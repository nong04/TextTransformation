"amber and ladonna at the starbucks on southwest parkway are always so warm and welcoming. there is always a smile in their voice when they greet you at the drive-thru. and their customer service is always spot-on, they always get my order right and with a smile. i would actually give them more than 5 stars if they were available.",5,Very Positive
"** at the starbucks by the fire station on 436 in altamonte springs, fl made my day and finally helped me figure out the way to make my drink so i would love it. she took time out to talk to me for 2 minutes to make my experience better than what i am used to. it was much appreciated! i have had bad experiences one after another at the starbucks that is closest to me in my work building with my drinks not being great along with not great customer service from specific baristas. niko was refreshing to speak to and pleasant. the drink was perfect! store 11956",5,Very Positive

"me and my friend were at starbucks and my card did not work. thankful the worker there, paid for our drinks. and was very nice about it, it did not seem to bother him that he paid for our drinks. this made my day, but made me look like a fool because my card did not work. all thanks to dillon. at shoreline wa in safeway. thank you so much dillon for the help, support and, kindness. i rate this 1000/10 if i could but, other than that, 10/10.",5,Very Positive
i am on this kick of drinking 5 cups of warm water. i work for instacart right now and every location of starbucks i was given free hot water because i asked for it without being charged. i really appreciate starbucks for giving me the opportunity to do such thing. that is why i give them five stars. they fully have my support. they are super nice and professional and the coffee is great. go to starbucks.,5,Very Positive
we had to correct them on our order 3 times. they never got it right then the manager came over to us and said we made her employee uncomfortable because we were trying to correct our order. the manager tried was racist against my stepmom (chinese) taking over her but when i (**) would talk she would stop talking and listen to me.,1,Very Negative
"i have tried starbucks several different times in different locations just in case it was just the one store. but it is not. if you like coffee that taste like dirt scooped off the ground at a garbage dump, then this is the place for you.",1,Very Negative
"starbucks near me just launched new fall foods and beverages yesterday. by noon yesterday they were out of all new items. the fall launch is huge and many people look forward to it all year. maybe if you do not have enough product to last even a couple of days, push back the launch until you do? i was so happy to get the email that it had come out that i left work on my break to brighten my day and so very disappointed to get there at 12:30pm and find out that it was all gone. please starbucks, do better.",1,Very Negative
"i ordered online for the reisterstown rd, st thomas sc 99000 and they gave me the wrong drink size so ordered a venti they gave me a grande. just a bit upset that i paid over 5 bucks for a drink and got the wrong thing.",1,Very Negative
"staff at the smythe st. superstore location in fredericton, nb often seen tired but today, a woman named senoa (senora?) was morose, glum, uncommunicative (even after i tried to engage her to sympathize, as there was obviously a bad mood happening), scruffy looking, almost rude. and, the americano i ordered tastes watery. i go to starbucks for a treat after a long day. it a difficult experience, to ease stress and have a pleasant experience. i am going to sell a different location after today is grumpy girl.",1,Very Negative
"i filed a bbb complaint last month because starbucks canceled my starbucks reward cards. i could not remember the balances, so i guessed about $9. starbucks played nothing but games and tried everything they could to avoid responding to the complaint. i received a couple of phone call messages asking me to contact them directly and discuss the matter. the number provided was the customer service number and when i spoke with one representative, linda hung up the phone on me. i did not use my card since 2012 which is my prerogative. because of this and other reasons, starbucks decided to close my starbucks account. i reopened one about a few weeks ago and added a new card that i have not used yet.",1,Very Negative
"every time i try to buy a strawberry refresher starbucks never has strawberries to put into the drink. how is the drink called strawberry refresher and you guys never have any damn strawberries. it seems every time we go on the starbucks to order a specialty drink you guys are constantly out of it. it is like calling a pizza place, and they are telling us they are out of cheese. i do not give you a partial payment so i do not expect a partial drink.",2,Negative
insulted by customer service representative as i called to complain instead of acknowledge they have issues and they are providing low quality. she called me suspicious even though i spend at least average 15 dollars a day. was so upset and i decided to close the account after being with them for more than 10 yrs. company that does not appreciate feedback soon to fall especially that it lost its quality.,1,Very Negative
"i would give starbucks zero stars if i could. i received an email that i would be receiving a birthday reward on the day of my birthday and it would be good on the day of my birthday only. the email also stated that the reward would be for any drink or food item. i went to an starbucks near my home. the cashier told me my coupon had expired. i told her i do not have a coupon. its a birthday reward. i ordered a sandwich. the cashier said i could only purchase a drink. i showed her the email. she said, let is try it and swiped my card. she said it did not take so she asked if i wanted a drink. i told her to just give me a venti hot coffee. she swiped my card again and said it did not work. then she asked, ""are you sure it is your birthday?"" i showed her the email that said in big letters, 7/15. i told her this is july 15 and this is my birthday.",1,Very Negative
"on june 21, 2023 i purchased coffee and a breakfast sandwich for $8.10 at the starbucks located at the target store in mays landing, n.j. i was not given purchase credit and “star” points for the purchase even though the cashier there scanned my starbucks app. i reported this to customer service the next day and was told to email them a copy of my credit card receipt to their customer service address, which i did. i have still not been given stars to my account or credit for this purchase. i have attempted to contact them on multiple occasions and they have not responded.",1,Very Negative
"my mother sent me a $15 gift card purchased from walgreens in june. she came to visit me this past weekend and brought the gift card receipts. i contacted walgreens to replace the cards. i was told to contact the merchant (starbucks). i called starbucks and spoke with a representative today, explained my problem. he asked for the card number. when i provided it, he transferred me to a different department that handles these issues. i got another representative. i told this representative why i was transferred over. she got silent and ended the call. it is like no one wants to handle issues or do their job.",1,Very Negative
"was handed a coffee in a drive through. the lid was not on right and the top edge of the cup was bent. when i accepted the coffee and was going to place it in my cup holder, the cup bent, the lid fell off and the coffee spilled all over myself and my newly detailed interior. not the way to start a day especially on the way to an appointment. now $$ for coffee and detailing.",1,Very Negative
i am at 20th and l in dc. there are a dozen people here and only one employee to make drinks. unacceptable. i have commitments to get to and i do not have time to wait. it is already been 20 minutes. i will not come to this location again.,1,Very Negative
i have been purchasing starbucks a lot using my cash app card. i reached out to starbucks customer service so they could add my purchases or receipts to my account for points. i emailed them and received an automated email back saying someone will reach out to me. no one has as of yet. i sent out another email and still did not get any assistance. starbucks is ignoring me about receiving help,1,Very Negative
"starbucks como lake. bad attitude of the cashier, demonstrative arrogance and did not greet me, misspelled my name, then laughed at me with the staff. orders are often confused, it is better to take a check in order to get the desired drink later. the order took a long time, one day we had to wait 30 minutes. bad place.",1,Very Negative
"this past sunday, 5/21/2023 we went through the drive in and bought 2 double smoked breakfast sandwiches, expecting it to have back and gruyere cheese and an egg. they did not. we got 2 buns pasted together with unidentifiable something. we were on the road somewhere or i would have turned around and returned them. i know their food comes pre packaged and only warmed at the store, so i fault the company for falsely selling food that does not meet the picture on display at the ordering kiosk. just how many millions does starbucks need to make on a daily basis? their food is already overpriced. i mean, how much does 1 egg, 1 small slices of bacon and cheese cost?",1,Very Negative
i was overcharged for a venti brown sugar shaken espresso. i looked at my paypal notification and there was 13.40$ taken from my account for the coffee drink. very unhappy about it. i would like a refund of the total price. if not i will never buy another product from you guys. i go to starbucks on the regular. i am just really sick and tired of being taken advantage of.,1,Very Negative
"i received a gift card on 4/20/2023 but not able to use it today, 5/11/2023. i believe no one should purchase starbucks gift card anymore, because this is the 2nd time i was not able to use a starbucks gift card...the first time was a thank-you card from the coordinator of our church is foster the city program; all of us ""support friends"" helping out the foster families with various tasks received a card but it turned out we were all told not to use it because for reasons unbeknownst to him the cards were invalid. sadly it happened—again...this time i received a card from a trusted friend and the same happened. i already texted her and let her know what had happened. i am having a bad feeling starbucks is having some kind of scam. i am so appreciative of my friend is kind heart and texted her about the card because i feel uncomfortable about what starbucks is doing and personally i will not purchase starbucks gift cards in the future, anymore.",1,Very Negative
"i spend about $30/day, is it asking too much to have a lid that does not fall off? i have contacted starbucks customer service for months being told they are addressing the issue but nothing changes.",1,Very Negative
during covid their restrictions were over the top and still require staff to put cream and sugar in my coffee. starbucks this is nonsense - no wonder you have 3 stars. why should your customers wait for a cup of coffee as if i had ordered a frap. dumb policy. sell coffee not politics.,1,Very Negative
"for me to come on here and leave a review for your store on town east (new store beside hs) y'all need to do better! tell your employees to stay off their phones and put effort into doing their jobs or employ people that actually want to work! i waited patiently for my coffee as did everyone else but my frappe tasted like crap! i do not drink starbucks very often and if i do i go to the one on military and never had an issue there whatsoever l! but today, i happen to be in the town east area and decided to treat myself to a frappe! unfortunately it tasted like crap, and seeing an employee on their phone after receiving my coffee irritated me cause if they put as much attention into doing their job as they do their phone it probably would get them more than one star!!",1,Very Negative
"me and my special needs son need to wait at a starbucks for an access van. the store has only teeny tiny tables, where two people can not sit at, as the table is far too small. and round, so the tables can not be joined. the staff, told me starbucks is making it extremely uncomfortable for a family to eat inside, and difficult for couples, people with special needs, basically everyone. the table is a little bigger than a stool. i was told the staff and many complained, though corporate office stated to them, star bucks is not a family friendly place, not a place for a group of people to meet. they said the corporate office said, despite the complaints, the tiny tables stay,",1,Very Negative
"it has chemical odors and makes me gag. my friend dared me to have some and i barfed all over the store. they spelled my name wrong on purpose, my name is kemmis but starbucks spelled it as chemist and i said, ""that is not my name, it is kemmis.""",1,Very Negative
"ok so, i already had in mind to stop going to starbucks since it was costing me like 250$ a month. when i saw on tiktok how unhealthy their drinks really are, i just knew i had slow down my intake. but today that was it for me. they told me that to have a free drink is no longer 150 stars - it is now required to accumulate 200 stars. no way, this is a sign from the universe for me to really stop drinking their unhealthy drinks. they can go and require 1000 stars for a free drink if they wish - i do not care because, i really am not interested anymore.",1,Very Negative
i bought a caramel macchiato last night on 03/02/2023 and there was particles of a white cleaning rag in my drink. pretty much starbucks is not doing anything which is awful and disgusting. i have lost my ambition to buy coffee from starbucks forever after this experience and with their customer service.,1,Very Negative
"my account got blocked, i cannot log in and i have a substantial balance there. i have already spent hours on the phone with customer service trying to resolve this. the issue was even ""escalated"" to a senior rep. but after months of going back and forth and me bagging to return my money, starbucks reps say that there is nothing they can do. they wouldn't issue me a card for the balance or credit me back on my credit card.",1,Very Negative
"all the money starbucks makes not only are they ungrateful to their employees but what is the point of being a loyal ongoing cu6 when you have to pay more just to start using rewards, why would they change the amount you need to earn? it is bad enough all their starbucks games you do not win anything big. it is like they are all rigged that way...not to win.",1,Very Negative
"in my opinion, i can not believe starbucks has now changed it to 200 stars for free handcrafted beverage!!! it was 150 so that means spend $150 and you get a free drink! not anymore. the coffees are already outrageous as it is, they ask you tip now with new card reader which is super uncomfortable in the first place. may start going to 7 brew, it is good, cheap and 5 minutes from them here in kingsport.",3,Neutral
"on 01/23/2023 i purchased starbucks beverage located in las vegas. upon receiving the beverage (caramel macchiato), it was drowned in caramel sauce. caramel was thrown in the cup and to top it off an excessive amount of caramel was put on top. i requested the beverage to be made again. upon departing property, i realized that the steaming wand was never wiped down. i returned home and contacted starbucks via email to leave a complaint. i was contacted back and was informed that i would be receiving a full refund for the purchase. on 02/04/2023, i received the gift card through mail. looked to see how much was refund and showed, 10 cents. due to the lack customer service, i will be taking my business elsewhere.",1,Very Negative
got to starbucks inside food city before 6 pm. asked for a large decaf. i was told they could only do a half caf. very disappointed in their logistics function. a viable business should have its ordering of supplies rather optimized by the time they are a mature business.,1,Very Negative
"i know a lot of people line up for this stuff but the coffee is not that good. i guess that is why they put in so many flavorings and sweeteners. if you like just coffee, try somewhere else. many to choose from. i will not name them here. this is not an advertisement.",2,Negative
i have had enough of this companies deceitful ways. a 16oz grande and 24 oz vente both have 2 shots of espresso. all you are paying for is more milk which weakens the taste. logically if a grande has 2 shots then a vente should have 3. the shots have already been reduced in size over the years. secondly tips are based on performance...to ask us to tip before we can even finish cashing out is no right. you are pressuring us to leave a tip before we even get our coffee. what if the service stinks? i think you should go back to using a tip jar that way if the service is good we can tip and if not we can leave. i am only one person but you have lost me as a customer and i will do whatever i can to spread the word.,2,Negative
they are always out of stuff at lakeport commons in sioux city!! so forger mobile ordering! mobile ordering takes your money then when you get there told out of something and you lost money. never have the sauces you want. out if matcha for green tea for weeks! out of ice coffee at least 2x week.,1,Very Negative
i had purchased a drink on my app at an airport. i went to pick it up and they said they could not make my drink because the blender was broken down and could not refund my money. i asked them how i would get my money back. they said there is a phone number on the app and the phone number goes to the store and i have called the store nine times and no one will answer. i send an email to starbucks corporation 2 weeks ago and have heard nothing. i will no longer visit or you starbucks..,2,Negative
"they wonder why they have to shut down locations. this company should be called makeothercoffeecompaniesbucks because they do not care in helping people out who can not get into their mobile accounts. second time this year i get locked out of my account and no matter what i do i can not get in and then when you call customer service they can not speak/understand english and say they fixed the problem when nothing gets fixed, then someone tells you someone will call you and nobody does. i am done with this company. thanks for saving me hundreds a month!!!",1,Very Negative
"yet another person with a horrible experience at a starbucks... specifically, the starbucks at johnson creek crossing in portland, oregon. i was trying to give my order at the drive-thru, but apparently the person who was taking it could not hear me very well. a short, decaf vanilla mocha non-fat no-whip. still, she had every thing right but the vanilla, so when she asked me if it was right, i said ""everything but the vanilla."" she said she was having trouble hearing me, so i said loudly ""va-nil-la!"" she said she was still having trouble hearing me, and for some unknown reason changed the drink to a grande vanilla latte, so i said loudly ""moch-a!"" and then asked her why she changed the drink/size? she said she more about not being able to hear me, so in a very loud voice i said ""short... decaf... vanilla... mocha.. nonfat... no whip"" at which point she said i was treating her badly and refused to take my order.",1,Very Negative
"so i went to starbucks at the kroger on lower fayetteville and there was this old man serving coffee there so i went up to there and asked for a tall americano and he asked my name and i said it but he said he did not hear me so i said it louder. so when i got my drink, i was just sipping it until i looked at the receipt on my cup, it said trenae, worst service ever!!",1,Very Negative
"i cannot believe starbucks closed off all of the outlets in their stores around me. i would visit sb solo and with clients at least 6-8 times per month. spending real money. one of my favorite past times has been catching up on emails while enjoying coffee and food. now, i cannot come back knowing that i can not be productive while there. ya just lost a loyal customer for almost 20 years. wow. just wow.",1,Very Negative
"starbucks had an ad on veterans day for complimentary coffee for vets. i go to starbucks at least once a day and my sherman oaks location did not know about it. i called corporate, who confirmed it was a fake ad. i asked my san diego marines about it, and they advised starbucks was honoring it. i went online to contact starbucks, and they said they would look into it, call me back, and even looked on my account and said they would gift me $10. all was a lie. i was never contacted, did not receive the $10 (unimportant), and reached out this morning and was hung up on. starbucks has lost a loyal life long customer. i will also tell every veteran i know that starbucks does not honor service members and they have no integrity. disappointing!!!",1,Very Negative
starbucks offers reusable holiday cups when purchasing a holiday beverage. they refused a diabetic an unsweetened beverage because it was not one of their “holiday” beverages. one would think they could have been more accommodating.,1,Very Negative
"refused a free coffee to me and other veterans in franklin, nc on veterans day as offered on starbucks' national website and offered in newspapers statewide. as a long time customer of starbucks, i am no longer a customer.",1,Very Negative
so mad. i go to the green bay starbucks here which a lot of the time i get great service and it is a good place to go but when i get a cold drink a lot of the time the lid does not stay on at all. i have so many instances where i grab the cup and it falls off. well today i ordered a green tea and then i was drinking it in my living room and the lid completely came off and fell out of my hands and now it is all over the floor and into my carpet. not ordering there again until this is fixed. it is a 5 dollar drink and i should be able to drink it and not have it all over the floor because of an issue on their end.,1,Very Negative
i did a mobile order and it gave a time of 11:35am.... i went to pick up at 1134am.... i waited 45 minutes until i went up to the register and got a refund. my problem was the manager on duty.... she told customers to stop bothering the employees and they could get orders out. as a retail worker that is unacceptable to say to your consumers. that does not react return business. that is a foul attitude. i will never visit the tilton starbucks ever again. they are unprofessional and rude.,1,Very Negative
"i love the starbucks on sunset! the new one on elms springs is not quite there yet! friendly which is amazing, just they do not quite have it down yet! my daughter and i went there yesterday and it was watery and not as nearly wonderful! so we will go the extra miles to go to the one that knows what they are doing! our money is just as important as your money!",2,Negative
"i have recently realized how difficult it is to find a starbucks that has electrical outlets available to customers for charging laptops and cellphones. at first i thought, oh this particular store just never installed them. however, that is not the case. they have purposefully removed them in order to save electricity, a slap in the face to us loyal customers who spend gobs of money on their overpriced drink and food already. i always figured, well it makes sense, i will pay the extra price for the opportunity to enjoy hanging around using wifi and tapping some power, but they have gone too far now. uh uh, you guys are not right! i still appreciate free ice cold water and whipped cream for my dog, but in the back of my mind lurks the knowledge that they have given and taketh away. i have banned you from my go to restaurants list, in fact i might never step into a starbucks ever again! that was a shameful thing you guys did!",1,Very Negative
"miserable customer service, executive department and website/apps. we have a starbucks account where our payment method is linked to our account so we may earn stars for rewards. the starbucks cafe we go to is in a market32/price chopper grocery store. previously, every now and then purchase history shows with the $ amount, but no stars, shows as 0.0 earned. then this started happening on a frequent basis. called customer service, most speak english with a very broken accent. explained the issue.",1,Very Negative
very stale egg product in sandwich. unusually weak coffee. unlike most starbucks. very crowded store. staff overwhelmed. go to caribou coffee instead. they need to test their products for freshness on a daily basis.,2,Negative
"i frequent this particular starbucks about 5 times a week. this is the edgemont branch location. my usual drink is grande in venti cup, extra milk. most of the employees know my face and some know my name as i go there quite often. today i went to get my usual drink. i know exactly how much coffee and how much milk goes into the cup. the coffee level is at the edge of the circle on the cup. so when i saw the amount of coffee was less than usual and had too much room, i pointed it to the employee. she then proceeded to go to the back to talk to someone else, then came back with a measured cup and said we can not do that and talked to me in a way that really ruined the experience for me as she was making a fuss over nothing.",1,Very Negative
"while on vacation, we stopped at this starbucks on 3388 poplar ave. in memphis tennessee to use the restroom. by the sink of the women is restroom, there were roaches half dead. in addition to the filthy restroom, everything else inside smelled damp, like old, used towels. you could also not wash your hands with soap because there was no dispenser. there was only one other restroom available which was out of service. will have to keep my options and eyes open from now on.",1,Very Negative
company continues to raise prices when they have been generating revenue for years. they do not pay or take care of their employees well at all and they continue to lay off employees. will never get my business.,1,Very Negative

"i used to spend over $100 a month in starbucks coffee and do the receipt upload for stars as part of the loyalty rewards on top of buying several drinks from the on site barista when i was near one as i am not local to any. then starbucks stopped the receipt upload for stars, so now i am boycotting starbucks due to receipt upload ending and now buying from black rifle coffee. over the years starbucks keeps chopping away at the loyalty star program. in the past you got way more star benefits but now it is super skimpy.",1,Very Negative
i am continually disappointed when going to starbucks. i am not sure they are reading the room… so to speak. the cost continues to go up… as all things. but there should be a level of competing with the competitor. in our town we have 2 new dunkin donuts and they are less expensive. no am sure they are pulling customers. it also seems they are shorting the cups. do not seem to be full on the craft drinks. service has been much better than last year. have been a consumer for a long time. just seem it is time to feed the customer more obviously than points.,3,Neutral
"2) starbucks has continuously cut their rewards program over the past few years. now, you have to ‘activate' double star days. they know the more trouble they put people through, the less people will get the benefit.",1,Very Negative
"purchased one cup of coffee and was charged 3 times for 1 cup so i am owed a credit to my debit card, however i was told after calling the 800 number that they will not be able to give me credit and the store will not likely give me a credit because it has been over 48hours. i suppose i should have assumed that they were going to rip me off with this triple charge and check my account and since i did not do that they decided to keep my money or offer me a card so that i lose my choice of where i spend the money that they stole. such poor business ethics.",1,Very Negative
"ok i know how the staff at starbucks at 23811 washington ave, murrieta, ca · (951) 461-1699 the service has to be one of the worst i have ever been to. i started going to this one over 2 months ago and they still do not know my drink. now it is very difficult. it is any hot coffee with 10 sugars stirred in then extra cream 1/2-1/2. now if that is too hard to get how the hell did they get a job. i have been to starbucks all over and in less than 3 days they know my drink but not here where 2 months ain't enough to understand something so simple and yes i go in every day.",1,Very Negative
"a place to be. the space i chose was starbucks. never in my life would i have imagined that i would be interested in writing a paper about this. i am currently traveling and it has been a place that i have been frequently visiting to sit down and take care of my studies. i am an avid coffee drinker also and love to sip on a beverage and take care of what i need to take care of. it is peaceful, although sometimes chaotic. i enjoy being able to sit down and do my work. i believe it is a great place for students like myself to sit down and be productive.",5,Very Positive
"i walk to the starbucks near my house every other day and get the same drink every day, chai tea latte. the service is usually great and i do not have to wait that long at all. the employees are friendly and kind. this goes for other locations that i visit. unfortunately, the quality of starbucks products has significantly declined and the prices have skyrocketed but that is understandable given the current economy. every time i get a chai tea latte, it either tastes like water or nothing but milk, and on top of that, i am paying a premium for the venti size.",3,Neutral

"the starbucks coffee drinks cost a good deal of money. so when i pay for a coffee drink. i expect to get coffee, not a milkshake. but there are milkshakes hidden in the frappuccino menu. if it is for kids. it should be labeled ""kids drinks"" or ""milkshakes."" that is just really disappointing. i ordered a strawberry creme frappuccino, thinking that it was like the strawberry funnel cake frappuccino, which was really good and had coffee in it. but they stopped selling that and instead there was just this disappointing strawberry milkshake that i ended up with.",1,Very Negative
"i am 58 years old, crashed my motorbike on a plastic starbucks sign that was in the street and was injured and my motorbike was totaled. i contacted starbucks and they promised me they would take care of it and agreed verbally on an amount that they would pay me. i agreed not to file a lawsuit if they would do the right thing and i have given them over a year to take care of this. they have not kept their word at all, completely dishonest and untrustworthy and never tell the truth. who would ever want to drink their coffee of a company so dishonest and untrustworthy.",1,Very Negative

"there is no social responsibility at starbucks. starbucks is one of the most polluting stores in our city. there is no recycling whatsoever. hundreds of plastic cups are tossed into trash each day at just one location, and thousands of them with all the locations in our city. when i asked the manager for the recycle bin, he shrugged his shoulders and said, ""i do not know how to get one."" i walked out and saw a recycle bin that was being used as a trash can. i contacted starbucks' website and gave my feedback, but nothing was changed at the local stores. for a company who pretends to be all about community, they are destroying our planet faster than most of other stores.",1,Very Negative
"regular hot coffee of different sizes is too insipid and tastes almost like hot water in several starbucks locations in southern california. one of the possible causes for the insipidity of starbucks regular hot coffee is that store coffee brewers are not replenished with fresh coffee in a timely manner, especially during store rush hours. we made store associates aware of this issue at a few starbucks locations but have not seen any tangible improvement. this is a quality control issue that warrants serious attention from starbucks' top management.",1,Very Negative

"we are at mco orlando airport by gates 1-9. i waited 30 minutes in line to find out there was no bold blend. the girl behind the counter asked me if i wanted to wait 7-10 mins for them to brew a pot. i told her no, that i would already waited 30. (there were 6 employees behind the counter but i think only two working - in fact i walked up to the second register when a customer left and the girl there told me she was not open). so i finally got my two pikes ventis - had to charge thru my starbucks acct because i was not going to wait in that line again and not enough cash for two coffees..",1,Very Negative
"i have done my research and it seems like starbucks does hiring people who hasn't worked in this industry ""coffee"". you just need to have good customer services. you can not teach anyone how to talk to people but you can always reach them how to make something. i have 5 plus years in retail customer services but both places said i have no experience. they both hired people who worked at starbucks or have experience. yes, it is very true i do not have the experience, but i have the customer services. i thought i did great in the interview. i feel like if they only wanted experienced people, they shouldn't had even given me a call or an interview me. i felt my time wasted and their time wasted too.",1,Very Negative
"when ordering this morning i clearly asked for a venti drink. after i waited for a while, they brought my grande drink and i told the barista that i had ordered a venti. she said that they had charged me for a grande and i said ""ok, but i ordered a venti"" the barista ""not happy"" started making my drink again and went to the cashier and asked her something which i could not hear. when she brought my drink over, she said to go to the cashier to pay the difference. me, being a customer service supervisor, know the importance of treating your customers with kindness and knowing that if we mess up, we take the loss. what happened here? they made $0.50 but made my experience at this location very disappointing. when someone makes a mistake, own up to it and do not make the customer feel embarrassed.",2,Negative

"once thought starbucks was a smart company but not anymore. customers are not so stupid that they do not notice the changes. reducing the rewards program, making store environment bad enough to discourage staying (less seating and loud noise level), cuts to service, products, stores, bummed out employees, low inventory on shelves, crappy sugar drinks and food, and more. i have cut my visits by at least 50% and so have others i know. keep it up and in time a competitor will step in and/or customers will discover other options. sorry to see the old ways go but maybe this company has seen its day. sold your stock. do not believe you care about customers. short term a ""go cheap"" strategy may look good but long term lost customers will drop sales. buh bye starbucks. you are becoming just another ordinary place that is taking more than it returns in service and product.",2,Negative

the fact that you do not even allow a one week grace period to use birthday rewards now is the stupidest thing i have ever heard and it is not right. starbucks is so money hungry now that you do not even let me decide when i can go get my free coffee. what is next? are you going to have to use your regular rewards the day you get them after you have already gotten coffee that day? the way starbucks ruins the free rewards more and more every year is making me dislike starbucks as a company and makes me never want to go there again.,1,Very Negative

"i received my bank statement and noticed two back to back unauthorized charges for 50 dollars each. i have called starbucks over ten times to get this resolved. three times they hung up on me. the rest were a mix of random options, none of which has seen my money returned. i do not drink coffee nor have i ever had a starbucks card. they have said that my bank has to do a recharge for the amount, when asked why they could not do it, they responded by saying they do not have my credit card info. i attempted to provide it they said no. i asked them how did they take my money and not have my info.",1,Very Negative
"starbucks is getting more and more pricey for a bad cup of whatever you drink. everyone is sucked into this need to spend half your paycheck for a bad cup of joe. just because it is trendy. the quality of service and product has drop over the years but the price keeps going up, up, up. i am coming from a place where i see my wife spend hundreds a month on her favorite a chai tea. the thing that gets me is they never ever get it right when she orders. ever. 99 percent of the time they forget to put the whip cream on even when she says ""do not forget the whip cream."" or it will come warm not hot. think about it. a drink that cost $4.80 you think you could at least make it right. just so done with paying their prices for a sub par at best drink.",1,Very Negative
"well, i have had a lot of issues using my starbucks card. i called customer service to get a new card over a year ago and never received my card. i did not have time to call and get a new card so i just did not use it. also, your customer service is god awful and i am upset that i go to starbucks every week to get a coffee, as well as, my wife and i am never able to get the point. next, i was never able to use my card on my birthday because it would not register that i have a free birthday drink. thanks for that. it is just disappointing that this company can give two ** about the customer. thanks for the ** service over the years. lastly, try to get employees that have a better outlook on life. they all seem to be depressed. thanks or should i say, ""no thanks.""",1,Very Negative
"i called customer service to ask them to add my receipt from the store so i can have a stars added to my account. i explain to the representative that i left my phone at home that is why i have to pay cash. and his response was rude, well it is a one-time thing and it is my fault that i left my phone home. seriously!!! this is how you treat a customer who spends thousands of dollars a year for coffee and food at their place! never going back to starbucks again, i do not want to deal with people like that when i need help! and it is not like i was asking for free stars or rewards, i pay my money and i want my stars to be added to my account!",1,Very Negative
"starbucks stores are freezing!! especially on days where the temperature is between 60-80 degrees. i have complained on at least 3 occasions, but their temperature controls for ac are in seattle. unbelievable. furthermore, coffee is bitter (most of my friends agree) and the app is full of glitches. another example of how corporate offices can be out of touch with customers.",1,Very Negative
"bought the milk frother at the official starbucks website. had been a client for years. paid twice as much as similar product on stores because i thought that a company like starbucks would check the quality and consequently back up their providers, all to find out that the product is of a very poor quality. used it for not more than 20 times, paid $59.95 + tax for a product that did not last at all. when calling starbucks customer service, they need all sort of information, to corroborate that it is actually one of their products.",1,Very Negative
"i went to a starbucks and asked for a small coffee. the clerk taking my order began to educate me about what the sizes of cups were called, what a barista was and what starbucks represented. i indicated to him that i did not want to learn any of what he was telling me, that i felt no compelling need to learn their corporate culture and that, please, may i have a small coffee. he became bellicose. i assured him that he would not suffer my presence in his coffee shop in the future. i will not be back and btw, the coffee tasted burnt.",1,Very Negative

the stores can make their own rules which contrast with corporate policies and the head office do not even care about it. we even showed the store manager about the policies but they are ignored. we spent so much money to get to gold level and got my benefit waived because of their inconsistency. i never got any phone call from their manager to explain why they did it. such a big disappointment for a big company.,1,Very Negative
"starbucks sends out an email indicating, ""you are upgraded to a gold card."" woohoo. they say they offer you a free drink or food item of your choice, yet at the counter they deny it. really. these programs are only gimmicks to get you in the store and spend more money. every stupid retailer or restaurant engages in this tactic. a pizza place offers you a free personal pizza but the clerks push drinks and other crap on you. you spend more than the free personal pan pizza. stay away from these gimmicks. i am tossing the card out. and, a big reason why we have the health problems related to diabetes and obesity in this country is due to these designer coffee drinks. do you really need a coffee with lots of high calories and sugar, milk, whipped cream and other garbage? one drink has around 64 carbs. you are better off eating a slice of pie. save money and skip the designer coffee drinks. skip the so-called rewards.",1,Very Negative

"it depends on the management of each establishment as to the quality of service, the friendliness of the employees and cleanliness. it is always nice when the employee gets your order correct.",4,Positive
when you get a good barista you get a good drink but those are hard to come by at starbucks. now if you ask them to remake your drink some of them are okay with it but others have a lot of machismo or just way too much attitude. the consistency of the drink tasting as it should from different locations is rare here in el paso. if i would recommend anything i would recommend mesa street in the westside. there is a girl there by the name of vanessa. she is actually a great barista.,1,Very Negative

starbucks coffee consistently is excellent; breakfast sandwiches are large and delicious; lunch options are less appealing because of esoteric offerings;  employees appear engaged and customer-focused.,5,Very Positive
"i am addicted to starbucks coffee. very unmotivated staffs though. if you walk into any starbucks, you will encounter a variety of “cool nerds” with absolutely no awareness of the customers' time. more often than not, i get to relive whatever dysfunctional evening/weekend experience discussed/debated between the employees as the line grows and people question themselves as to why they keep coming back. it is the coffee. i even grind starbucks french roast at home daily.",4,Positive

the product is always consistent and good quality. the customer service is dependable and highly competent. you can always count on a good product. they are available and easily identified.,5,Very Positive
"i love the fact that you can usually get your favorite sandwich with your drink, what i do not like is when you go and try to get this one sandwich (chicken blt) and they tell you either they do not have any or they discontinued that one. please it must be a popular sandwich cause they were out so why discontinue.",4,Positive
the star quality of the service that starbucks offers is fantastic. they usually have your order out in quick fashion. recommend this chain if you are looking for great coffee.,5,Very Positive

"i have lived abroad 10+ years and having a starbucks nearby was a touchstone to the us. i have seen that starbucks provides more than coffee and muffins - at times it provides a safe haven to be left alone. although i currently live in the us (tennessee), i regularly travel to other states. i base my ratings upon observations of many starbucks' locations in and out of the us.",4,Positive
"their coffee is somewhat bitter and is very overpriced. in addition, i would like to see more gluten-free, or at least wheat-free, items on the menu. the advantages? customers can take their time enjoying their food and beverages if they choose to do so on premises, and nobody hassles anyone to move along. perhaps if starbucks paid their baristas decent wages, employees wouldn't feel compelled to put out a tacky and obnoxious tip jar, something customers have been seeing more and more of in places that do not offer table service! did starbucks start this annoying trend, or just encourage it?",3,Neutral
"the employees seem to have the same far left elitist attitude as the ceo and general direction of the company. why anyone would spend $5 on coffee escapes me? for that $5 i can get a pound of coffee beans, store them in a vacuum container and grind fresh coffee every morning.",1,Very Negative

"a little expensive, sometimes slow service and/or long waits, and sometimes dirty, but people still go there. i tend to go when i have time to sit down and visit with people or do some reading. but careful with the blended frozen drinks, unless you are not worried about calories. also their espresso and iced coffee tends to be a bit on the bitter side.",4,Positive
the service at most of the locations we have visited has been very good. our local location knows our name and what we usually order. the staff is well trained in customized orders.,5,Very Positive
starbucks not only has a wide variety of great coffee but it has the most tasty and healthful food choices. i also like the products it sells and go there for small hostess type gifts.,5,Very Positive
"i went there was a friend, we went in there and got two drinks both of them iced or blended. basically we got to frappuccinos. they were very considerate. very patient while we ordered. and had a great attitude. however they did mix up the drinks. i was lactose intolerant and they put regular milk in besides soy. fortunately though they caught it and fixed it. and the service was very fast.",4,Positive
"their service on the drive thru is usually very slow and what they give you on the sandwiches is not worth the amount of money they charge, you would be better served going to mcdonald is.",4,Positive
you never had this tell starbucks twice what kind of coffee you want. i like the caramel coffee and scrape and it is always that way and always has been that way.,5,Very Positive
the coffee is so strong i can not drink it. other drinks like apple cider are fantastic and the dessert options are fabulous. it must seems to be extremely strong coffee that leaves bitter taste in your mouth.,4,Positive
"coffee is always fresh, and all the staff courteous regardless of crowding; menu could be expanded but it is not really intended to be a full service restaurant.",4,Positive

starbucks at an airport is not of the same quality in coffee or food selection when compared to non-airport branches. do not go to an international based starbucks with the same expectations as the usa.,3,Neutral
the mobile order is very convenient and customer service is consistently good at most locations (although i have a specific store i am loyal to when not traveling). their prices are ridiculous for their specialty drinks but i generally prefer my coffee unadulterated. also i do wish their non-dairy milk choices and whip cream did not contain carrageenan.,4,Positive
great service. never have problems with this chain unlike mcdonald is or burger king. however it is expensive. i cannot go there daily and too much calories.,5,Very Positive
"starbucks in cathedral city ca needs more baristas. service is very slow. i also wish they had more salads and greens instead of pastries, sugar, and even more carbs. the ambiance is generally good, which is why i return. there is a starbuck is in desert hot springs where i live, but it is too small, does not have enough tables, and store layout is not good. same general problems with menu, but coffee is always good at both places.",4,Positive
good coffee choices although the coffee is better and cheaper at mcdonald is or dunkin. good bagels. food choices are not great but they will do. biggest plus: the staff are intelligent. biggest minus: people (often young and healthy) hog seats without consuming food. and there are too few senior friendly seats (chairs with backs that are a normal height so that your feet can touch the floor).,3,Neutral
starbucks employees that gotten out of hand. they try and act too cool and they think that they are above a lot of people do not like the attitude there. too pompous and if you are undecided on what to get they do not want to really help you. understand that they are a busy place but attitude to make a big difference.,3,Neutral

"was charged for a regular coffee instead of a free refill. i am a gold card member and therefore receive them free. i did not notice till i checked my acct because this store had just allowed another customer to terrorize all of the other customers at this location and did not do anything until he made a sexual comment to an employee. typical, starbucks does not care about their customers only the money. the customers had to call the police and ask for assistance because starbucks did not want to be bothered. they did not want to draw attention to themselves with having the police showing up at their store. they would rather have another customer assault the other customers than provide a safe environment.",1,Very Negative

i have been going to starbucks for years now but recently started to try the breakfast sandwiches. the ones in the display you can clearly see the bacon is not fully cooked. this is the same mess they not only gave me here in philly but sides of attitude with it. location here on a popular street there is one barista that for some reason has it out for me. i have never given attitude or made crazy demands yet he is always condescending when talking to me and purposely messes up my food. one barista will twice cook my bacon like i ask so it is cooked. the miserable one however cooked the sandwich twice giving me burnt bread and raw bacon. i do not know if he thought i wouldn't notice or come back considering my job is right across the street.,1,Very Negative

"i enjoy their services and customer service. not a huge fan of their coffee as it is a bit bitter. their plastic tumblers only give you about 6 months of use before you start tasting plastic heavily in your drink. even with following the proper care instructions. i have thus stopped purchasing plastic tumblers. i have noticed that fellow customers are somewhat snobbish and seem to have a me, me, me attitude and want to be first and out the door. it is not at all uncommon to have people cut in front of me because i was half an inch out of line. or at least that is what i noticed in several of the king county, wa locations. at the company i work for, the employees leave free expired treats from their kiosk in our break room. yummy, but at the same time with a word of warning: i have on one occasion received mild food poisoning from this. appreciate the services though. just wish they did not monopolize the area so much.",3,Neutral
"i often go to this location to buy coffee or tea, because it is convenient. the service has been hit and miss. i order venti black tea lemonade without the sweetener many times during warm weather. today, i saw a barista making this drink purposely with tea and water and ice, with no lemonade and no shaken.

"the starbucks in seattle [83 and aurora] 95% of the time, will not put a sleeve on my venti tall extra hot latte. i politely tell them that cup is extremely hot to hold, thus adding a paper sleeve absorbs the heat. their reply is usually to point to the sleeves and then states ""you can put it on yourself"" or points to the sleeves and say ""there they are"". inexcusable conduct to a potential serious situation that can happen. the employees need to be retrained and know safety protocol to extra hot beverages.",1,Very Negative
"recently, i noticed that the card balance went down faster than usual. also heard from 2 friends over the past 3 months that money would be taken from their cards mysteriously. so, out of curiosity, i checked the purchase history. i discovered the unauthorized deduction (total of $12.05) occurred in 2 different starbucks stores. i asked the cashiers to redeem the rewards on food but evidently they deducted the value of the food from my card ""and"" redeemed my rewards. in a sense, i doubled paying them (real $$ and the rewards that i am entitled to use on food). i sent an email to its customer service and got an apology email of experience and an reimbursement of $12 only. i am very disappointed with the corporation.",1,Very Negative

"i am a daily customer of starbucks, and my experience is near perfect, except for the music. i would give starbucks 5 stars, but their music in the morning gives them only a 3 stars. they should stop trying to sell music and forcing music on us that detracts from an otherwise positive experience. (their latest attempt at this their ridiculous spotify.) furthermore, they should give each store a variety of choices instead of one-size fits all. no music is better than what they are trying to cross market. whoever is in charge of the music at corporate is way overpaid.",3,Neutral

"i had a balance of $27.93 showing on my card every time i looked at it for quite some time on my regular starbucks card. last saturday, i attempted to transfer it to the gold card and the transfer was not complete, but the balance shows zero on my regular card and did not show up in the gold card. they told me i had not refreshed my card on the internet. now i have looked at that balance on several different internet screens, so i am not sure what they are saying. on the iphone passbook it still shows the $27.93 balance, but nowhere else. what happened to it? they said i did not have a balance.",1,Very Negative
"this morning, i picked up the sunday edition of the ny times and paid a healthy $6.00 for it, only to discover that this freshly opened paper was missing sections. in the past, i had picked up the same paper and found 2-3 sections missing, and attributed it to someone rifling through it at the store prior to purchasing it. but this morning, the newspapers were still bound together and had not been read or touched by a prior reader. and again, the travel section and the book review section were missing - and those are my two favorite parts! now i realize that the prior incidents were not done by someone else and instead, this local starbucks receives and sells a partial paper for full price. has anyone else encountered this?",2,Negative
"i live in grove city, ohio and our starbucks employees are awesome and friendly! i go there so much they know me. so my complaint is not about our franchises here or the employees. i am bored of the choices that are offered and i think the mocha coconut frappe should be brought back! it is cool and refreshing and not too rich. it seems that if you do not like caramel, your choices are pretty limited, which i find annoying. i always look forward to the change of seasons to see what new things you are going to have but lately it is just the same stuff over and over again! so, i have resorted to trying frozen coffee drinks elsewhere because it is something different! and they are cheaper! i want the mocha coconut brought back along with the mocha malt frappe that you had summer 8 years ago or so. it was very, very good!",2,Negative
"i had to wait in a very long line 5 different times to get my order correct. all i wanted was my scone heated and served with a fork and napkin. why was that so difficult? toddler walked in with his mom and started hitting both me and my laptop. mom said, ""he was not hitting you that hard."" i said, ""it does not have to be that hard if you live in chronic pain."" starbucks' employees did nothing to help me. i had to quickly leave. police said that i should have called them asap. i did not want to cause a scene. corporate starbucks sided with the employees and said they shouldn't have helped me at all.",1,Very Negative
"the starbucks on north and wells has got to have the worst customer service of any starbucks i have been to throughout the entire country. why is it if they mess up a simple drink, they give the customer an attitude? no matter how many times i clearly repeat my uncomplicated drink, more often than not, they make it wrong. then, how dare i ask to have them politely remake it... how dare i! newsflash starbucks employees, if you make a drink wrong, you might have to remake it. shocking, i know. when you make a customer is $6 drink wrong, it is not their fault, it is yours. therefore, instead of giving an attitude, the right thing to do would be to apologize for your error.",1,Very Negative
"i go to starbucks often and this is the closest to my home. i most often drink iced coffee with milk. they almost always try to ""sweeten it."" i never order it sweetened, i always say nothing else after placing my order. this is not what prompted this review. yesterday morning at about 7am, i was excited to get a ""free"" drink and use my card on my iphone app (yes i go a lot). when i took out the coupon and was about to ask if i could get my usual (cheaper than the drink on the coupon), the barista said someone had mass produced the coupon so starbucks was no longer accepting it? how can you stop using a coupon with a good date on it? i did not want to be without coffee so i bought an iced coffee with milk and they got it right; but the guy in front of me brought his back because they added sweetener without asking. this is a newer starbucks, but it has been there long enough to not worry about 1 cup of coffee vs. losing a customer.",1,Very Negative

"i always go to the starbucks in oakland, on hegenberger, and i have never really had an issue with service until last night! the barista ** was rude to me and my children! she seemed very detached from her responsibilities and ability to be friendly. usually when i come, i only see two girls, ** and **, who are both very sweet and willing to do what it takes to satisfy me and kids. ** always puts a really big smile on my kids' faces and mine. she is a really sweet girl. unfortunately she was off tonight. but last night, my kids asked for pastries and ** (""person in charge?"") ignored my son, due to her deep concern with texting. she never even acknowledged him standing there. ** later helped him. i studied for some time to overhear the night shift complaining about the job to a guy who came in. if she hates her own manager and the way she is treated here, why not quit? it will probably do us good customers some justice!",1,Very Negative

"after numerous complaints to starbucks about an incident that occurred at the indian harbour beach, florida store, it is quite apparent that starbucks does not care how customers are treated. foul language is acceptable towards customers, telling customers to shut-up is also acceptable. slamming customers is also okay, from the rude barista at the starbucks in indian harbour beach, florida. be careful of writing to corporate as you will be labeled as a troublemaker, by the manager. and if you think you were treated badly before, it gets worse if they are told who wrote to corporate. i will never go back to this location. the main barista has had numerous complaints and still has a job, disgusting!",2,Negative

"i am currently a college student and i make it a routine to visit starbucks whenever i have a huge exam coming up or final exams. it is a great place to study and enjoy my favorite coffee at the same time. but the last couple of times that i have been to the starbucks by my house, i have ran into a crowd of extremely loud folks that hang around inside and speak really loud. they even arrange the couches and the chairs in a circle so they can talk. they scream across the place and even the employees working there are really loud!",1,Very Negative

"i really hate to complain but i felt i need to let you know that on saturday november 19, at a starbucks in nyc, when i gave my order 5 times to the counter clerk person, he could not get it straight. when i was given my hot caramel lattes, they did not have any caramel in the latte, just milk and coffee without any flavor. this is the first time i had ever had any difficulty ordering my lattes and my marble cake. if given this place a rating of stars, it would get the lowest being 1/2 star.",1,Very Negative

"starbucks has implemented a ""one button"" entry for a peppermint white chocolate mocha as part of their holiday promotion. this button rings the drink up as a single item, costing $4.75 for a venti sized drink. prior to this programming change, the same drink would come through the receipt as a white chocolate mocha costing $4.25 with a separate line item for the peppermint costing $.50. this difference is not visible to the consumer until the conclusion of their transaction. when the customer pays with a starbucks gold card, the modifier charge is removed, reducing the price of the drink by $.50 -- one of the specific benefits of the gold card. when the drink has been entered as a single item, there is no modifier line to be removed, therefore there is no deduction for the peppermint that was added to the drink.",1,Very Negative

(hello he has been there almost a year and still do not know the safe) any who, i was there yesterday there were 4 people on, one lady was pacing while waiting cause she was going to be late for work, another asked why such a long wait, another walked out without their drink. and i as well walked out without my drink, after paying for it because i had waited 10 minutes for a cup of coffee and i had an appointment i had to get to. it is horrible. i wish someone would just do something about this and take the customers complaints seriously.",1,Very Negative

"starbucks at 4801 west maple rd., omaha, ne 68154 is very unhygienic. a fly landed on their closed dessert shelves. i went to the store to get some frappucino on my birthday. i frequent that store at least once a month for the last 5 years. my daughter and wife was with me. my daughter noticed a big fly in the cake dessert covered shelf. this fly appeared to be landing on many of the desserts. my 11-year old daughter brought this to the attention of a starbuck service lady, but was given the brush off. i myself then brought this attention to the same lady a minute later. initially she tried to brush me off as well, but when i insisted on knowing what she intended to do about it since it was very unhygienic. she then mentioned that once she complete making my order, she would remove the fly and all the desserts to the trash",1,Very Negative
