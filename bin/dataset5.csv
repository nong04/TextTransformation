"food is descent enough desert options were also good
starrers were also tasty
one bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time",4,
"short review decent breads and starters bad shaam savera a little screwed up daal makhni but should be a oneoff case
better ambience at night and importantly good quantity
i wanted to give a 25 but that is not an option 
extensive
ambience it is better at night friends who had been here during the day did not like it much so if you prefer ambience go at night
food ordered a hara bhara kebab shaam savera daal makhni rotis and raita yes i am a vegetarian 
the good part quantity 
i was excited to see shaam savera on their menu but take it from me you do not want to order it it is no where close to what it should be they messed it up real bad especially the colors
the daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me it was not creamy too 
the breads and raita were decent
the hara bhara kebabs were decent too soft they had an extra outer coating of peanuts so if you are not a peanut fan on your kebabs ask them to skip that step 
conclusion it looked like they had made food in a hurry
would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases if things change you will know",3,
"excellent food and very good service by soumen das
ambience was good too with live music food was served timely decor of the restaurant was amazing as well",5,
my review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lot is of place even though the food is good in places like these special hey to papiya shuvro,5,
it was a very nice experience food was amazing friendly staff with welcoming attitude papia was very friendly and accommodating good ambiance i will definitely recommend this place,5,
had dinner with my friends menu is perfect something for everyone service was awesome and papia was very accommodating good ambience with amazing live music will be back definitely,5,
service experience was very good especially by papiya food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well i would like to visit beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price,5,
service  food and ambiance was very nice staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food live music was like cherry on the cake,5,
the food was  we ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all papiya shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all,5,
staff are just polite and responsive food is the best part here and it is better as ambience also awesome here i met two persons here named papiya and shuvro who are the best at their services food items i liked here were basket biryani and kodi drum sticks finally just loved,5,
i came here with my parents we ordered for thai peneer tikka kaju pulao and veg biryani the kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good this is a decent place to go with family shubro and papiya served well,4,
well we are new to hyderabad  and i can for a fact say that it is probably the best place i have eaten a buffet at in hyderabad period  especially id like to thank shurvo and papiya for their amazing service  double metha was just too good  overall a worthwhile experience,5,
wonderful place with awesome ambience best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods shubro and papiya were good with service,5,
"good ambience and great servicewe have had buffet for 25 peoplethe waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad
shoutout to shubro and pradeep took care of our entire afternoon",4,
"my review of the place comes after multiple visits that have spanned over 4 months and now i can safely say that it is one of the good places around
they are located near the biodiversity signal above fabindia there is ample parking for both two and four wheelers the ambience is a bit dim after dark and the seating is divided into various options including a pdr section
the menu design is in the shape of a bottle and the array spans continental chinese and indian cuisines here is the list of things that i have tried across all my visits

panko crumbed mozzarella sticks   cheese sticks that are coated and fried pure cheese bliss
veg lasagna   this place has one of the good lasagne in the town
crispy chilli corn kernels  the usual favourite this one has a slightly different presentation here
makhmali paneer tikka 
cottage cheese shashlik sizzler
italian nachos  nachos topped with red sauce and cheese and baked in the dish
cheese and cheese pizza   soft base pizza loaded with cheese and a few pieces of green olives

i cannot stress enough on how i have loved all that i tried here i have also tried out their lunch buffet the variety may not be as elaborate as other places but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings it is at least a onetime try but what i really adore here is their mocktails beyond delight is an absolute delight also a fan of the guava and chilli and apple and kiwi night drinks

the staff is ever so courteous a special mention to papiya and shuvro who were our attendants on the latest visit the place has zomato gold 11 which further brings down their reasonable rates a meal for two would roughly be around 700 that fills not only your tummy but also you heart",4,
"had lunch today at beyond flavors the food was very good and delicious and awesome service was provided by soumen das  shuvro would highly recommend the restaurant ",5,
the reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables we went on friday afternoon we waited almost more than 30mins to get a table we lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v did not get a table even aftr waiting for such a long timei think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer,3,
service is really exceptional cheers to manav who served us really well food was nice too loved the ambience too with nice music playing in the background,4,
"soumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soon
soumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soonsoumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soon

this was the first time we visited this restaurant and the experience was good in terms of food hospitality service and ambience thanks to shubro and papiya for their hospitality,5,
"we went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in zomato

the spread in buffet is too less just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters 2 main course in veg and non veg just one fried rice and chicken biryani
desserts are ice cream and jamun

the taste was ok and not to expect too much little disappointing when starters are not hot

fish fry was decent schezwan chicken was ok
veg spring rolls were too good
big surprise for me is onion rings as starters 

kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour
chicken was ok biryani is average egg fried rice was good

for the money we pay we expect some good food they use much of colour in food item is

suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters

overall experience is ok but they can be much better for the amount you pay",3,
the place is just beyond beautiful ambience is excellent and food is good the service by soumen das is extremely good highly recommended place,4,
"i have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes it never disappoints

we went for a team lunch such a worst restaurant food was tasteless service was very slow and ac was not working we have requested them multiple times but its of no use please do not waste your money and i strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,1,
"discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office walked in and ordered some food thinking it would be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet
but but the food turned out to be a saviour and the way they have designed this place is indeed remarkable the lights and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food",5,
"second time being here it is really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well very courteous staff and very hospitile
taste is good but the best part is presentation it is really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant 
very impressed with mr ahmed  pradeep and mr dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well good job guys keep it up",5,
we ordered vegetable lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka both of which were absolutely delicious the ambience is amazing and the service is good,5,
one of the best food experiences i had in hyderabad the desserts was yum appricot pudding is must have ahmed khan your service was unparalled keep up the good work,5,
"ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour he may suggest great food as he has good experience the staters and sizzler was too good the sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat
great experience in beyond flavors",5,
had dinner at this place and the attendant was papiya the staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome good variety of food and beverages,5,
"we happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really likedneedless to say the ambience and music was really good we had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seatthey served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really goodthe buffet spread was one of a kind
strters  veg  paneer tikka veg spring roll and veg cutletthey were lil cold but the taste wad good
non veg  chicken kebab  chicken manchurian and fish fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hotchicken was fair enuf
singapore noodlesegg salad and pasta  they were good but it was cold
main course mutton rogan josh chicken tikka masalapalak paneer all were equally good
biriyani egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great
desserts  moong dal halwa tasted really yumm ice creamgulab jamuncut fruitsbanana cake

the staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slowwe had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full

they could improve the above points to stand better
overall 32",3,
"good ambience with an absolutely delicious food
i have got best company here by ananya beyond flavours
the place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff
great place for friends",4,
"i have been at this place for dinner a few days back the ambience was good the restaurant was almost half occupied we immediately got a table but then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu that too after a few reminders we ordered a few starters main course items and mock drinks only the starters could be served in 30 mins there was no sign of mock drinks we noticed similar service issues on other tables noticed guests literally shouting on the staff

the food was just average dishes were not prepared well at least when compared to 41 rating on zomato

we finally decided to just have starters and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal",2,
"i have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences
1st time it was with colleagues and i loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly their special baked biriyani is work a try it is unique and tasty
because of the good experience i revisited this place with my sister she orders a mocktail and it was terriblethey replace it but it was still not good and then i asked them about a starter if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both it is disappointing to know that the staff does not know about the menu",3,
"it is one of the best places to hangout with friends seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etc
food was very good and the ambience was also very nice
loved everything",5,
"ambience is good and staff are polite and friendly food is super good and had nice time having lunch  keep up the good work thank you for your nice hospitality loved it   ",5,
i would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt if you add that yo your food it would taste way better so basically none of the food we ordered had salt we ordered fries panko mozzarella sticks tomato cream soup panner65  italian nachos not sure how that was nachos or italian they basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top the beans were not baked at all and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave the paneer 65 was horrendous might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt next was the mozarella sticks which was again cold and no salt the only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup thanks to gid we didnt order any main course all these came up to 1300 and odd thanks to zomato gold our price went down this place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve and talking about the restaurant in general the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots they really need to clean up more,1,
"hostile staff okeish food not so great ambiance not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 41
starters we are decent but main course was horrible
will not suggest this place",1,
thanks ahmed food is great will recommend to visit again and again service is excellent and ambience is good  we had a great time with my family,5,
this is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of moneyi am personally highly recommend this placegreat flavour of food and very much prompt serviceambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant,5,
food quality and taste is not good super slow service nice ambience but very poor in customer handling lot of items not available even if in the menu,2,
this was my worst experience at a restaurant ever first our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour then had to wait for another half hour to get our food and the worst of all they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna we figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it i do not recommend this place at all there are so many better places in gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service,1,
this is the place i really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food loverpasta and sizzlers are so yummy that i cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than otherservice is the part were you really satisfied,5,
i am very much impressed by the quality of food and service specially mr ahmed thank you for your politeness and readiness about food i can only say that it is beyond flavours loved this place must visit great ambience,5,

"here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in gachibowli area this colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh

ambience is quite good and has optimum free space this place seems to be set up for team lunches only  the menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you will not be able to taste each and every itemi do not even remember all the names

starters are mouth watering as i write may it be veg or non veg to begin start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it this section includes sushi golgappa aamras shot etc this is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds

delicious starters are served on your table the one of the attraction is the pizza oven you can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a master chef certificate  hoping you may use it in your resume main course also has some delicacies worth trying i am not naming any because i was having foodgasm that i hardly cared to read names

desserts ahhahahhhaa
you have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets i had gulaab jamun halwa pastries and pan ice creamwhich is highly praised here

the ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch you will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc

only drawback is that during high incoming rush staff is in a hurry and you can not have much leisure time

i would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang i believe that you will not regret trying this fabulous place

"hi
this time we are not satisfied in flechazo starters are not much hot most of them are room temparature or little warm we have asked for fish starter we got only two pieces bbq wings are not good tooo hard mango chilli prawns not much tasty only maida coating smell no flavour nothing we are not happy with flechazo gachibowli",2,
wide spread buffet taste is good too courteous staff very polite we had a family dinner there and all of us had a lovely time especially kids love the live counters,5,
"i am not going to this place again though the ambiance is good flechazo gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene we went there as a family the first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor the chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place you find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around another unique practice i noticed was that while the waiter serves you the starters he is constantly touching the serving spoonstongs to the half eaten food in your plate then you find him serving the same starters to the next table
the place is chaotic with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters the main course buffet has limited choices too
but for the well thought of ambience there is nothing positive i could write about this place",1,
"the starters were good  especially mutton starter  they are many varieties in chicken then other items 
the ambience is so good and the staff is great 
jayanta service was very good and food was on time thanks to them ",5,
"flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world the mediterranean and asian it has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings

food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in gol gappas kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the diy concept to the table

starters stuffed mushroom is a good option and veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content
main course you will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani rice and curries leave some space for the pasta though
dessert this section gives a whole new meaning to the term spoilt for choice

this place is indeed a foodie is delight",5,
"visited on 12 may 2019 for lunch with family awesome food comfortable seating soothing ambience booked table through zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes

went in early at 1130am brunch welcome drink soup and starters served at the table they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them super delicious

apart from the buffet spread they have live counters for pizza pasta chaats pani puri yummm sushi keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks starters are aplenty veg and non veg the servers are attentive and helpful

desserts was a mix of indian sweets pasteries cheesecakes fruits and their speciality liquid nitrogen icecream fun to watch though i am not sure if healthy

i was surprised with a mother is day cake complements of the restaurant that was a wow gesture a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food",5,
i was there on the mother is day and food was amazing  service by jayanta ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggd,5,
"i went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato

good things first the service is excellent the waiters literally takes care of you when you are there

food nothing great as am more of a starter person  i love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it is not served the way you like it the sushi and pani puri were very okayish type
main course was very normal nothing extra ordinary taste of the food was very normal
in dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good

service it is very good and all the servers are trained very well

ambience the place was jammed packed even for a tuesday lunch could not enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter

all in all a very okayish lunch",3,

there were many items on list but taste was not so good

do not be fooled by word unlimited beverages only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you can not choose the flavour

totally felt disappointed by taste but customer service was good",3,
good place to hang out with friends  the panipuri on the conveyer belt and making your own pizza are the main highlights for this place,5,
oh i had so much hope on this place looking at the descriptions and all but this just turned out to be an imitator of abs may be with few concept changes here and there ok the food is fine and all but it is just the expectation of being different,3,
an decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters the place was crowdy even on a week day servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying but the finger food on conveyor belt was cold the pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment could not get to main course but the spread seemed interesting would love to visit again,4,

"i absolutely loved this place let me begin how comfortable this place is the sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy we were served with welcome drinks few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of  chat and fish later actual starters were served to us on our place for a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try for vegetarian chilly paneer crispy corn chilly fries here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later the mediterranean pasta is better than the white one later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting the food was also good in sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good even try pan ice cream
the staff here is courteous and friendly as well
overall you can enjoy a happy long fun lunch or dinner with your friendsfamilycolleagues",5,

the fish served as a part of starters was the best i had eaten in a very long time
mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention
the service is good and the staff is courteous too
but sadly despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide this was disappointing and could have been avoided",4,

it is seldom you see a restaurant with 49 rating my friend and i had come with great expectations but the restaurant did not manage to live up to any of it even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there coming to the food the sushi is not good the chef is not aware that you do not give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi the starters were okay and we did not repeat anything in spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn then in aglio olio they used macaroni the main course had a terrible array of dishes and none was good the biriyani had no chicken the couscous salad had just quinoa and olives the chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk all in all a very forgettable experience however to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special,2,
i visited flechazo today with my family the ambiance is very pleasant the service provided by ranjit and ramjan was excellent food was nice we have several options for starters especially i liked fish starters very much main course is also very good coming to desserts i love the ice cream they made on the spot this provides several food options in all starters main and desserts one the best place to try with family,5,

apart from the starters the main course dessert the wonky table we sat on was just a big disappointment the ice cream was made with just cream and chocolate sauce with dry ice and that is not good,2,
very mild and refreshing taste best for starters and deserts thanks to ramzan ranjit and pritam for helping out with the dishes and continued follow up with the taste of the dishes,5,

this time i have experienced mandi it is very nice quality mandi lovers will sure love this here with i will request the restaurant add more pics of chicken r mutton,5,
nice taste of biryani and the price was also fair ambience was goodwent with my team they loved itstarters were excellent with crisp and spices,4,
"no that good when compared to tolichowki branch starters are good but not the main course and biryanis
tolichowki is the main branch for shah ghouse",3,
used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city to my dismay i ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12pm tastewise it seemed average but as i was hungry i finished it fast fell asleep at 2am to wake up at 5am with a severe upset stomach this went on and when i woke up by 10am my stomach still hurt i am pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards nonetheless if they keep this up they will gradually lose their clientele would recommend a place called cafe 555 their haleem is far tastier and does not come with the complimentary food poisoning,5,
food is good but for the second time around they did not send us our complete order had ordered 4 naans got only 2 also got daal tadka instead of daal makhani not sure if its the ramadaan rush but now twice in a row our online orders thru zomato have been messed up probably will avoid going forward,2,
best hyderabad biryani if you are visiting hyderabad and you are a non vegetarian you must visit this place and taste the authentic hyderabadi biryani,5,
"i just went for the biryani and it did not disappoint we ordered the special chicken biryani it was spicy and tasty and seemed proper hyderabadi one dish enough for two people easily decent service as well
ambience  355
food  455
service  45
cost  45",4,
its a worst thing happened with mewe ordered for mutton family packhere i got chicken familypacki dont know who is neglegance is thiseither restaurant person or delivery boyi made a call to restaurent to know what is the problem isbut they are not responding at allplease check when you asked for food delivery,1,
i have placed order for mutton haleem special  3 qty and biryani rice  1 qty shah ghouse and zomoto together delivered shortage of mutton haleem special  1 qty informed to deliver executive while collecting parcel and reportes to zomoto support zomoto team said that no response from shah ghouse regarding shortage delivery finall zomoto also not confirmed anything and accepted refund only missed item value packing also very unhygienic totally upset with shah ghouse and zomoto,1,
biryani was oily,3,
i heard haleem will be so good etc etc but taste is not that great as others said just boiled the meat and grinded like paste nothing special in it,1,
"it is a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems shah ghouse
tip ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me it tastes much better we also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious",4,
"always the best the taste of the biryani is so unique that i can close my eyes taste the biryani and tell that it is shah ghouse biryani

i deducted one point for the behaviour which could have been better not pointing towards any specific scenario but i would prefer ordering online from shah ghouse than going there and eating specially when i am late

the quality sets it apart from its competition it is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime 

i judge a restaurant by its consistency and shah ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality",4,
ordered kaju panner they have delivered chicken curry so disappointed enquired with zomato delivery boy he says we just pick the item and come,2,
i ordered mutton biryani for lunch today the mutton was not cooked properly it was hard and unchewable i had high expectations from this restaurant as i had heard good feedback from a friend i was really dissapointed,1,
i had shawarma so many times in so many places but no one can prepare like him it was so tasty and price was also okay and they always respect the customer instructions,4,
they send me wrong order i ordered mutton biryani and they send me chicken biryani and this app is worst app we can not even get in touch with customer care,1,
in regular days its a good place to have a good biryani but during ramzan the quality of food goes down in terms of taste but haleem is always good here,3,
"the place to have one of the best biryani is in hyderabad chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome the food is hygenic and well cooked chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at time

cheers rakshita nath",4,
ordered haleem from shah ghouse it has got really very good taste quantity and consistency really satisfied with the order but samll suggestion please add some more dry fruits,5,
my second haleem this year is shah ghouse and after that i have tried at 4 different places trust me the taste at shah ghouse stands out and it makes you go back at its crowded outlet and have more of it 100 delicious,5,
forgot to send the spoon,5,
awesome taste must visit in hyderabad good place to visit with friends or if its for team lunch recently added mandi also yummy taste especially haleem,5,
shah ghouse is a best place for hyderabad biryani their quality and quantity are really satisfied they have all the branches with same taste,5,
"i have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and i have never been so upset of course i have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which i ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now orders can not go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city yet another incident today where my order was wrong you can check with my name what i ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th may19

hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes i wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either they deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time guess zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right",1,
when you will order you will get other item surprising restaurantwheather you order chiken you will always get veg cheap cost item better to do not order food my suggestion because i ordered more then twice got less cost cheap unordered item save money,1,
perfect place to order for mutton biryani and mandi superb taste but a miner issue with this restaurant is it is so busy on weekends and they will not concentrate on ordered items and some times they deliver incorrect order otherwise it is awesome,4,
the waiters were very rude that the hotel is very busyif you ask for starters and soups they say it will late order biryaniinam shocked with their behaviour with customers,2,
"the contact number in the true caller shows best cheaters in the world good
i had ordered for mutton biryani nd i got noodles which are ugly wow i am so happy for that
good keep it upbullshit
how careless they are for delivering this type of service to customer who orders for food
this is really disgusting and bullshit
i suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurantshah ghouse gachibowli
better remove service from zomato
many of our friends had many issues from this restaurant like delivering different food from ordered food and delivering one shawarma instead of two and others
zomato authority should take of all these problems which are spoiling the name and fame",1,
food and taste is fabulous nothing there to complaint but the way they use containers for delivery need to improve sometimes for curry orders packages are leaking out to be top all the facilities provided by restaurant should be in best quality,4,
ordered special chicken biryani biryani was great in taste but ambience was not good also this restaurant is too unhygienic and over crowded,3,
"absolutely everything about shah ghouse is amazing you wouldnt mind the ambience much as food is finger licking good you can tell that the place serves good food as it is always crowded they serve the best mutton biryans shawarmas and murgh musallam  not sure of the spelling
5 stars  only for the food ",5,
"will be visiting this place at least twice in a month
chicken biriyani and chicken lollipop will be fab here
prawns curry and rumali roti is goodmust try dryfruit falooda and butterscotch falooda",5,
shwarma was really good biryani was average with hard huge chicken pieces paneer dish was also average they have seating for everyone from bachelors to family,3,
the biryani here i found very delicious worth of money all spices were blended and mixed well but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste,4,
amazing taste as compare to all other restaurants around gacchibowli telecom nagar hyderabadthey follow all instructions care fully so 5star,5,
i ordered an egg biriyani and got a chicken piece in it disgusting never ever going to order from this restaurant again disappointed,1,
not at all fresh,2,
the chicken sp biriyani was just delicious wonderful service first try in hyderabad definitely one of the best experiences high speed delivery and hot food,5,
ordered veg biryani here the vegetables they used especially beans are awful the are almost became like drumstick on chewing and cant eat them will never order again neither recommend to any,2,
shah ghouse biryani is better than paradise it is is very soft and warm when you open a packet and nice spice scent good quality of chicken its uses for biryani i always prefer to eat first this one in biryani category,5,
me and my friends has a mandi at shah ghouse restaurant which was at gachibowli and our experience was really poor comparing to others restaurants in hyderabad,3,
"worst food no quality this would be the worst biryani i ever i had in my entire life this the chicken biryani without chicken and the chicken is mashed up and keema and i would say this is chicken keema biryani ",1,
food taste better here the food servicing is not that much good the food preparation time is bit high if you have patience to wait then you can give a try for it,3,
the taste of biryani is so good rate is pocket friendly i recommend shah ghouse for good biryanigood food good taste like shah ghouse biryani,5,
delivered on time,5,
no onions for any biriyani full fake delivery do not order and believe them they are delivering false biryani and fake identity of original,4,
biryani is good but tandoor was not up to mark but still for non vegetarian this place is heaven plenty of items at reasonable price,4,
"we ordered egg biryani and we were delivered chicken biryani with chicken replaced with eggs he tried his best to pose it as egg and biryani but he forgot to remove bones from the biryani

wouldnt order egg biryani from here again",1,
ordered sechwan rice from here the rice was not cooked properly and it was too dry and hard to eat with full off oil i have not expected such food from this restaurant they should have eaten the food first before it is sending out for delivery,1,
ordered regular chicken biryani but the rice was not cooked and the i ordered double masala which i did not get and the taste was not that good which was great when i ordered before,3,
biryani is always tasty the best part is restaurant remains open till late night whenever we have party plan we use to order from shah ghouse,5,
"taste is good but the service at gachibowli was really poor which compelled the guests to look for another option despite wanting to stay ",3,
mandi seema lovely items should definitely try it but item should be hot  to better its taste service in the restaurant were not that good for the family orientated people there will be late what ever you try,4,
very very bad experience for me the waiter servicing was very bad i really irritated a lot by this environment  very bad feeling to me i requested u please improve customer servicing l they not even response us i should call 5 more times i really feeling very bad for me first time such a bad experience to me,1,
the food served here is good and mutton biryani is super tastythe service is friendly we can order from our car like a drive inn one of a kind biryani i have ever ate,5,
"the biryani is awesome you will surely crave for it but only nonveg biryani
chicken shawarma is toooo good and yummy yummy starters are also very tasty",4,
"was trying to go to ter charminar branch but due to small mistake in cab bookings ended up at tiz branch took ter ac hall in d 1st floor typical resto arrangement and ac was mild and filled with biryani aroma
ordered chicken tikka 230 juicy well marinated and perfectly cooked chicken qty was huge served with mint chutney splmutton biryani 280 biryani had huge portion which can easily serve two good eaters biryani was served with a egg and about 1012 pics of tender mutton pcs biryani lived up to its legendary status vfm 55",4,
this is my first order in shah ghouse nice food perfectly cooked i ordered prawns biryani and i never had this taste in hyderabad especially aroma of rice was so tasty temperature of food quantity and packing is awasome,5,
this is bloody disgusting i had to wait for more than 120 mins for my order and after that got a call for cancellation of the order if you can not sever the order let the customer know about it do not made him wait for a long time 120 mins of sunday is precious for me to hell with your service,1,
"i visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on zomato though the restaurant claims to be authentic original hyderabadi taste the gachibowli branch was open in 2015 given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic it looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining
so for ambiance and hygiene it is a complete no
food was okay we ordered apollo fish starter which was very hard and spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and paradise or pista house has better taste than it quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us and it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings
i would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone",2,
one of the finest biryanis i have ever seen my favorite biryani rather than paradise or pista house very tasty food and good looking restaurant,5,
i have ordered egg fried rice and some roties from here at night 11o clock the food was okish i do not know if i ordered in time roties were also not that much good,3,
i ordered chicken biryani online zomato delivered it ontime but food quality was very bad honestly i doubt whether they are serving chicken or some other meat i had to thrown the biryani that they delivered very bad restaurant that i felt,1,
not good,1,
worst food received low quality rice was used egg fried rice was almost spoiler unable to eat worst experience ever does not recommend,1,
"it is one of the famous restaurants in hyderabad for hyderabadi biryani it serves several non veg items this restaurant is quite crowdy it is a good place for family lunch or dinner

"great food okayish ambiance decent service exactly the place you want to dine with good ol friends

one of the best biryani restaurant in hyderabad kebabs and other mughlai dishes are also delicious highly recommended for all nonveg lovers,5,
"visited this place on 24 march2019 as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there we went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there but we managed one not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded such is popularity of this place lets find out how the experience was

ambiance



its a multistoried restaurant and every floor was full to the brim with several biriyani crazy people we got seated at the second floor the floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table the seats were well laid out  comfy and spacious ratings  355

service



the waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food he paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help overall service was fine ratings  45

food



here comes the big deal lets find out if all the craze that this place generates is worth it actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended family pack chicken biriyani along with reshmi kebab and ginger chicken for starters the starters arrived and they looked yum the reshmi kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping made with the nonyolk part of the egg  the kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth the ginger chicken was tasty as well must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces which was pretty filling for even four of us then came the family pack biriyani which was more than enough for even four of us we even had to parcel the leftover the biriyani here has a very different taste here its not that spicy but its delicious no wonder this place is so famous ratings  455

value for money



all these food for just thousand bucks need i say more pisa vasool ratings  55

lets calculate

rating  ambiance  service  food  vfm4  425

loved the chicken biryani totally mild spiceswell cooked rice4 big chicken pieces but somehow got disappointed by the butter naan and chicken masala anyways heaven for biryani lovers,4,
shah ghouse hotel did not deliver my order after making payment online zomato to ensure my online payment to be refunded as early as possible,1,
our regular place to have chickenmutton biryani the flavour is awesome can not get the same anywhere most favourite is special chicken biryani the biryani will be completely different compared to the regular restaurants style,5,
ordered chicken briyani and vegetables briyani it is was good as usual if they could increase the paneer in the veg briyani that would be brilliant,3,
"please do not visit this place in the night if at all you are going along with your family
no service after 1200 as the zomato says it is open upto 200complete missguiding and fooling customers
i am a fan of the biryani served herebut the staffthe timingsand the cleanliness over here is a clean bullshit
better to visit the other branches like shalibanda and tolichowliplease do not visit this holy hell
i posted some pics just look at the table where we dine to eatyuck",1,
i have ordered through zomato 1 chicken and 1 veg biryani and received chicken and egg biryani  this is second instance happened  i have thrown away the egg biryani and also the taste of the chicken biryani is not so good,1,
most disappointing experience ever ordered for vegetable biryani during midnight hours from this restaurant delivery through swiggy was quick and swift but to my surprise i received only biryani rice absolute no vegetables or masala very bland taste too i do not understand why these restaurants cheats customers if they out of stock i would not recommend anyone to trust this restaurant,1,
horrible biryani this is what we got when we ordered on swiggy it looks like you just want to make money selling biryani and left over pieces,2,
offers one of the best biryani is in hyderabad also their irani chai is awesome both of them are must try you will not be disappointed place is little crowdy though,4,
i had heard a lot about this place so i went there the dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins food etc i anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy but then i saw a rat nibbling on the scattered food i reported this to the manager and he told me it is okay and ek do galti toh ho jati hai and they literally forced me to pay for my order which i did not even touch the staff was highly rude and it has been one of the worst experiences in hyderabad,1,
"original hyderabadi and ghee flavoured mutton biryani is my fav item from this restaurant and i am totally addicted to this dish

best quality too not 300 i am ready to spend 600 for a dish like this",5,
food is decent and tastes palatable not the best though not very comfortable with the hygiene ambience is average service is poor good value for money if one can ignore the ambience and service,3,
can not ever say no to this place how much ever crowded it gets or the time one has to wait to get a seat here biryani is simply amazing definitely among the best in hyderabad,5,
the hotel never updates the status of the order i called zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order then the zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order next them mention it will be delivered by 111pm but again no update i called again at 115pm to check what happened to the order they again called the hotel to get an update then they mention your food is still getting prepared its in the kitchen what the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys do not mind to update or apologize i asked to cancel the order and zomato said it can not cancel as it will be waste of food great and i am stuck with the hotel is will to deliver it or not pathetic service,1,
good and polite delivery boy,5,

"went for team lunch on friday overcrowded and hard to get the place after 30 minutes of waiting got the table ordered tandoori platter and dum biryani

the managers are so rude to the customers twice they declined the entry on two consecutive days we came here looking at the reviews but the behavior of the staff killed the mood they seemed bias towards the guests and prefer people whom they know at the entry,1,

"if trying brewed beer is what you love to do  this place is a must visit  it is has a very rustic and welcoming ambience one of their best beer would be the otm lager for starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when i say it is one of the best vegetarian starters i had in a while  the lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate the sauce is sticky  sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors i would strongly recommend this dish as a must try also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture the chicken tikka was one of the best tikkas i had the meat was tender and perfectly cookedthe mint chutney was a perfect match to go with
if you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work  this would be the perfect place",4,

"this place was on my hyderabad bucket list for a long time the ambience was awesome to top that it was ipl 2019 final the live dj was great coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of belgian brewed  warning it is a jug rather than a pitcher but that is the best beer i ever had the beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza both of them were outstanding
the worst part was the service the place is short on staff one waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table",3,
over the moon name is not matching with ambience there is no roof top seating for this brewery outside seating was just average atleast the same ambience can be in the second are third floor service was very quick and fast because there is no other brewery in surroundings we can visit to this place,3,
"very slow service food was very cold and tasteless tables were not cleaned properly
not worth going again although ice tea was decent enough",1,

extremely delighted by the service by mr kundan indubitably one of the best brewed beers in hyderabad great service levels and ambience offered by this place,5,
i have always loved this place but my recent experience was horrible even after booking the table well before time  they gave me a table on 1 st floor with all stags around me  the worst part was that it was a friday where they say they allow stag entries the service was equally poor,1,
nice place to go to catch up with friends over a couple of drinks live music nights are really soothing and the ambiance is great service can improve in house brew collection is good but can add more variety to it since customers look for ranges thanks,4,
"i was really excited about this place as i have heard great reviews about the food so i went there with a friend to try out 
ambience its beautiful and so lovely and happening 
food  we ordered irani chicken tikka and a mexican pizza the chicken tikka was a lil undercooked and also it was bland 
dint like at all  the pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggies
service  its bad  really bad  might be the only reason i would not want to go again 
there are some great reviews about this place  but my experience was not nice at all so dissapointed
1 is for the ambience",3,

only reason am giving a 4 and not 5 is the air conditioner for some god damn reason was not effective enough be ready to sweat we had to remind waiter who was attending us constantly to keep it cool

nice place and food is outstanding service is very good american ale is very good vietnamese rice bowl and boti kebab tastes authentic niranjan service is very nice,5,
actually i struggled between 3 and 4 for this place where drinks are so good and buffet does not last to it but a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best a little costly caution if you are a stag majority of times they will not allow u on ground floor in evenings which is kind of sucks though finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive,4,
the customer service was very bad we ordered lobster and they served us prawns with lobster shells after a lot of argument chef accepted that yes we add prawns but as per me there was no lo aster meat also everyone from waiter to manager were telling different things,1,
"it was an awesome experience the staff specially kundan was really kind and attentive beer was really nice
thanks for the great experience ",5,

i went with my friends the apple cider beer is a must try in the starters the 3 cheese layer mushroom the burmese wrap is also a must try in starters pizza was good the crust could have been little crunchy pasta was ok ambience is nice the dj did not play the latest songs but the floor was filled with people the waiter sarvesh was courteous,4,
do ask for makhan if you visit great service  good beer fermentation smell can get some people uneasy but beer lovers will surely appreciate,4,
lit ambienceloud music and great beer apple cider is probably the best in town service is a little slow coz of the large croud perfect for an outing with friends on weekends,4,
"ambience of the place is amazing with good music they have three types of seating arrangements inside lobby and open space all options are good book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends hospitality of the place is also very good they serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers

apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer i have ever tasted the alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter must to try at this place froscher is another good brewed beer

veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach corn and cheese it was served with three different kinds of dips one of the dip was spicy one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all north indian food lovers though the naan was not chur chur it was plain naan paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of north india the best starter was burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce it was extremely good in taste

if you are in hyderabad i will highly recommend to visit this place",4,
parthu was awesome towards my guests he gave me the service i was looking forthank for your warm service which is beyond and above what i excepted,5,

if you are a fan of brewery u should visit this place i have tasted three of there beers they taste good food is very nice we ordered chicken and tandoori fish style murgh everything is perfect here serving is also fast zomato gold is additional bonus i felt they should allow stags on weekends on upstairs at least with a entry fee rest everything is perfect,4,
awesome experience and courteous treatment from deepak a great hospitality manager and his team great place to spend your leisure time thank you otm for all you do for your guests,5,
awesome service food and drinks especially the lunch concept if pretty cool here love keshav for his service and hospitality try the lager beer,5,
the place and ambience was goodonly sour point was our waiter kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him welli had zomato gold membership and showed him the sameinstead of taking a photo of the samehe started surfing the phone when i objectedhe denied checking the phone though the food and place was goodthe waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude which cost the two stars,3,
nice brew to hang out serving us really fast should thank partho for it next to highway is the only the negative stand for this limited choice for vegetarians nonvegetarian is really good,4,
"excellent food and service niranjan and karunakaran made our day

nice tender chicken and german wheat beer uttar wonderful place for hangout",5,
the place is awesome ambience is great food beer is just the best and the best part is service especially niranjan guy is very kind and polite,5,
went here to catch up with a friend very near the orr entrance and right beside the main road the interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there the seating was plush and comfortable the choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely the preparation and plating everything was about perfect but we did not liked the lemon soda it had some weird taste in all it was good,3,
over the moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from we tried the apple cider35 stout 45 and two others  think one was called moonlit 55 which were pretty good the food was superb as well we had the burmese parcel 55 nachos 55 french fries25 prawns 55 chicken kebabs55 chicken poppers 55 and mutton kebabs55 the place jas good music and later in the night people can dance overall an amazing experience in hyderabad which seemed to cover everything,5,
makhan provided really good service must place to go must try is belgian beer and stout chicken platter is good and fries platter is good to go for vegetarian,5,
"one of the best restaurants visited till date in hyd the have amazing ambience delicious food and extremely courteous staff
they are pro at making all the different delicacies and try to make sure that the customer walks out satisfied
it is a must visit restaurant and has amazing north indian food specially dal makhni and paneer butter masala the desserts are also amazing all in all complete value for money",5,
"special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare dinner last night at fisherman is wharf was one such memorable experience spread across an acre with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast we choose to sit in one of the mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture

now coming to the food started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best i have had in recent times chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar  

sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla icecream  to complete the meal the setting food and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us after redemption of the zomato gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child",5,
undoubtedly the best restaurant in gachibowli get a fresh fish masala  you will love it for suresit at the roof top and enjoy nicenbreezy air and feel of goa,5,
"if your a lover of seafood and goa is vibes and charm this place is definetly a must try a good weekend option for a lazy lunch
they have a huge variety of sea food cuisine live counters live music a bar section lots of activities for kids and ofcourse the elders too the vibes of this place will make you fall in love with it
ps choose the outdoor seating for a lively atmosphere ofcourse have the weather of hyderabad in mind too depending on the season",4,
"this place is very huge and rustic and gives you the real goa vibe you sure would get amazing non veg and sea food but they have good veg options as well and in my five to six visits to this place i have covered the entire vegetarian menu it is mouth watering and delicious
they also have live music on friday s",4,
"on a sunday evening my wife got some serious cravings for sea food so the first name that came to my find was fisherman is wharf on my last trip to goa i had the opportunity to visit their outlet near mobor beachsouth goa i will not say that i had an awesome food experience but i was blown away by their ambiance although they have opened an outlet in hyderabad for quite sometime  but somehow we were yet to visit so on sunday 19th may 2019 it was time for redemption we visited the place around at 830 pm in evening  and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked i could figure out that it was a full house

ambiance

at the reservation table we were courteously greeted then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at panjim restaurant we would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats but unfortunately all were reserved starting from decors live music the lighting well all i could say was that place was lively the ambiance may not be as good as their south goa outlet but its not lagging that far either ratings  45

service

as we were seated indoors at the panjim restaurant himanshu was incharge of our table he was polite  courteous and efficient  he was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time topnotch ratings  55

food

tada here comes the big deal my wife had prawn curry rice and i had fish and chips   the prawn curry had thick gravy prepared with coconut milk and goan spices and tasted yum  it was served with steamed rice for the fish and chips fillet well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well it was served with tarter dip i was really impressed with the food and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in hyderabad is a pure bliss ratings  455

value for money

hmm its a very important point is the food served worth the price absolutely yes my bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner and i am not complaining ratings  45

lets calculate

final thoughts

 
if you love live music goan shack kinda experience and good sea food then its a must visit probably one of the best place to chill out in hyderabad",4,
visited this place about a month ago and they werent very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out asap they were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food tried the fishchips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent,2,
"one of the best fine dining restaurant in hyderabad  superb ambiance and great service i personally loved the place and the way they treat 

tried spring roll tempura squid drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao fish tasted awesome overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed

coming to main course tried mixed veg pulao and dak bungalow chicken pulao could have been better one more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao

overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food better to have a reservation during weekends

"goan food at its best this place is as good as it is sister outlet in goa mimicking the goan ambience this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience

good for a nice sunday brunch the buffet for two is 1500 inr and worth the deal i would say the ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options would recommend,5,
this place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling designed to make you feel like your on vacation it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goamaking it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation we had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourfulmushroom tonak and mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well it is the place if u want to try goan cuisine,5,
perfect place for corporate dine outs had a great time with my team dinner wide variety of goan dishes and other food as well as beverages a bit expensive but ok the private space was good at margarita lounge,5,
overpriced coming to the weekends they does not make the food tasty fish was not good there is no flavor at all i the food  and 3 only for the ambience,3,

wonderful ambiance one of the must go places in hyderabad good food however reduced one star coz they have stopped their brewery and serving draught beer,4,
"ya i started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy yum and many pieces were given toothis hotel is famous for sea foodthought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in india tooi felt like limited edition of varities are a available herethen my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280this hotel gave a goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music toococktails and mocktails are available toothe waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also

this place is really good n relaxing because of the ambiance loved the place food was good it is worth giving a try live music is an add on to this,4,
went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet the place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either ac or outside because of the heat we went inside the starters and soup were served on the table there were numerous starters and it was very good the starters actually make you full the waiters were very friendly and helpful they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated the main course was good and there was a huge spread there the best part was the desserts which were awesome next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience,4,
great place to have seafood in hyderabad goan style beautiful ambience lovely live music must visit place for food lovers overall great experience will visit again service was quick and friendly,5,
very bad,1,
"the ambience of this place is amazing as the place is usually away from the city there is a sense of calm wanted to try seafood in hyderabad and i guess this was the best place available
the only complaint is they have buffet lune up till friday so the options for weekends are usually limited",5,
"been to this place couple of times but finally found time to share my review
great ambience with tasty food more of the chicken was delicious and juicy
one should also try the fries of this place

"beutifull indoor and outdoor sitting delicious foodwe ordered man how chicken soup  ok
loose prwans was good crispy chilly pork so yummy service is good",5,
bad for a sunday lunchthe place might be good for evening ambiance but afternoon inside the closedmost ordinary rooms with no music just chatter of other guests is a mood spoiler extremely slow service food is tasty and that is the only reason one could visit the place,2,
all kind of food is good here wrt al a carte go for famous dishes here eg crispy chicken not a disappointment for experimenting either dish of the day was not up to the mark sometimes pricey for regular visits,5,
"absolutely loved this place highly recommended

food delicious exotic hygienic we tried lobster prawns and red wine we wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available maybe they should keep the menu items in stock you may not get all the items listed 1010

ambiance beautiful live music great lightening for parties and a nice dinner 810

service satisfied they prepare food just like you would like it asking for instructions waiters were polite and nice they served us cake as we went for birthday celebration it was just a pastry but still nice gesture 810",5,
the ambience tells everything the place reminds of goa the must place for dinner the food is tasty and they should try the goan delicacies,5,
"waste of money
the worst place nd the waiter is was not cooperativewe have to call nd ask them to bring the starterzero starone of the worst experience ever had",1,
"6packfoodie goes the fisherman is wharf

food55 why 35 in the main review then
ambience 55
courtesy and staff 15
zomato gold experience 15

when we reserve table we expect to get the seat preference i booked the table for 2 with seat preference as outdoor seating the issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you have booked indoor seating when i did show the details about my booking then she said outdoor seating cannot be reserved if this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page disappointed

finally after the discussion we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view since outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking moving on lets go to food

ambience the entire olace has goan vibe to it the area is huge and there is a lot space between tables the sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in goa

drinks liit one of the best liits i had in hyderabad the lime mint juice was also tasty

food ordered beef chilly fry the tenderness of the meat was perfect spice level presentation was worth the price they have as per size menu for their specialities such as lobsters prawns pomfret we had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns again the presentation and the taste was class apart the spice balance was fantastic

now comes the worst zomato gold experience

before ordering as you woukd expect i unlocked my zomato gold which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary beef chilly fry in my case since it was lower priced among the two

the guy who served us did not come with the bill another guy came up saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary because as per size menu is not included in the zomato gold which means you have to pay for everything

this was never mentioned anywhere neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere

we had to pay for the entire bill irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff

later ordered one more dish as a take away which was made complementary

if potion size and value for money is what you are looking for then this olace is not for you if you are a sea food lover and want goan ambience in hyderabad then thumbs up

peace",3,
"went here while i was on my trip to hyderabad the place is really huge
best things about this place food variety of drinks dessert and fish

sea food lovers this is the place for you amidst all the hills in hyderabad
tawa fry fish is a must try
service is fantastic
music is mostly great
ambience is hands down a winner and good food along with a perfect mix of cocktails
goan style dishes would take your taste buds literally to goa
special occasions like diwali and holi are also welcomed here like home
family or friends fits in good for both
finding a place in the weekend could be time taking so recommend to pre book a table",5,
"if you love goa this place is nostalgic it has sectons divided with the names of places in goa like panjim colva baga etc

you do not need to give a second thought to the ambience at all its perfect for a date or a group

good place to have corporate party

friendly staff

food is awesome veg as well as nonveg

must try chilli paneer  nachos fried rice  chilli chicken prawn

all the alcohol they mention in the menu is available so not to worry for that even the beers

cocktails to try mojito cosmo mai tai sangria  these are what i tried and they are best",5,
had been here a couple of times nice ambience lots of place to sit courteous staff members wil want you to visit this place again the food is also nice i think we indian restaurants should start asking spice requirements so that we do not end up getting spicy food,4,
"i love sea food a lot and there are wide number of animals to eat  great ambiance friendly staff a non  vegetarian will enjoy this place for sure liquor prices are not goan prices ",5,
"fisherman is wharf is basically goan themed restaurant with a huge seating area they have outdoor seating facility as well as indoor seating arrangement they also have buffet area pub area rooftop area etc the ambience is beautiful now coming to the food we ordered

"food 4

ambience5

this is on the list for a long time and checked it off well it is an goan themed restaurant and they nailed the whole decor coming to food we went at 530 pm so not much of a choice in menu so ordered fish fingers and chicken starter both turned out good will definitely try again",4,
"the place is open seating gives a good airy feeling music is good and it had occupancy on a week day

we ordered catch of the day lobster  pomfret fish was very ordinary the lobster was done well main course was super prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours the star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like palak paneer at the first but had a distinct goan flavour spice on the higher side

nice place i would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day",5,
this has become my go to place now we went on a sunday evening and really had a very good time with some delicious food and the band performing was also very nice we ordered stuffed crab and i would say it is a must try dish it was just mouth melting in main course we had goan prawn curry and rice and it was good they also have fresh catch counter where you select and customize your sea food,4,
it has got just awesome ambience must visit place for sea food lovers the live music adds to elegance to your moments the food quality is amazing  the staffs are polite and kind,5,
"went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try 

during lunchtime the place had few patrons but the service was good we took an outside seating 

ordered a nachos platter chicken drums of heaven tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken accompanied with butter naan

the nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese the chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste the chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy we really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside 

overall the dishes were a must try with a large menu and varieties i know i will be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish prawns and lobster fare

dun bombard the menu with so many things great hospitality and tasty food is what makes a place happening not coming to this place ever again,1,
"this is my third visit to the restaurant and surely im going again it is a huge restaurant with very spacious seatingthey have outdoor seating indoor seating bar areabuffet area roof top area its pretty huge placeand every bit of the restaurant is amazing ambiance is spot onwaiters dress code is good too service is amazing they have perfect knowledge of what they are servingand always ready to help dinners hospitality is awesome but only one washroom is a meh
coming to the foodi tried many dishes like thai green currybutter garlic fried rice stuffed crab fish and chips alfredo pasta cheez garlic bread
i order thai curry every time i goit comes with rice its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistencyit tasted different all three times i tried it was good but different consistency matters
stuffed crab is amazingoverall must visit resturant its a expansive one but worth the visit i sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go",4,
this place has good ambiance but i had a weird experience with food the menu drums of heaven mentioned chicken wings but we were served drumsticks instead upon enquiring the respective guy tried to convince us the drum sticks are drums of heaven when we had to show him menu and explained the difference for crying out loud he said there is a mistake in menu and went next u guys be the judge,3,
"we have visited the place for thursday dinner buffet and kindly do not try it they have very limited options of starters and the choice of spread was really poor even the selection of alcohol was very basic
service could be much better in the buffet section as the drinks order need to be provided overall it is a total disappointment

kindly do not try the evening buffet as it is very bad",2,
i have been there with my girlfriend on a weekend the ambiance was soulful a bit expensive but the food was too good the staff could be more professional and my girl enjoyed a lot i should say hitting the gachibowli road for long ride do stopby there,5,
"been to this place on wednesday evening for family dinner  on a weekday also the place was crowded
the place is very spacious and there is not much to talk about ambience  it is pretty simple  service is at its best 
ordered  veg machow soup  fisherman wharf special soup  butter garlic prawns  masala fried prawns  fried fish  badami broccoli goan prawn curry  chicken wings egg fried rice  curd rice all tasted decently good except egg fried rice
must try  badami broccoli  butter garlic prawns  chef special soup  these tasted extremely delicious and special mention about curd rice ",4,
"the ambiance and setup basically the theme is just superb
very cordial staff and efficient too

the highlight is of course the food try the fried squid and butter garlic prawns a bit expensive but worth it

music is a little over the top and unpleasant at times",4,
food was not up to the expectation friendly staff the ambience was really good live music was very soothing would definitely visit again overall thumbs up for replicating goa experience,4,
"this place is good for your friend and famlilythey have good variety of appetiser
 their service is very freindly i have visit twise in this hotel  and also seafood verity is superb the dj was also great my over all experience was very nice
thakk you",4,
"situated at end of the city very spacious and ambience makes us feel like it was in goa  theme restaurant like a fisherman is place  number of sea food items available we can select a fish and make them prepare in customisation way  we visited for a friend is party  ordered many items but we are not satisfied with the taste  soup tasted so bad  prawns and fish items are not so much tasty  potato starter was good  squats in fish was good  ordered lemonade but not much great than i tasted before ",3,
awesome food and ambiance as alwaysbest place to spend weekendprebook your table to avoid waitingzomato gold acceptance is good,5,
should visit this place for dinner coz in summer you feel too much hot in afternoon that you can not feel the taste of the food nice place for corporate team outing food was good and absolutely taste desserts first,4,
"hi guys

i went here as part of an office party so can not really comment about the al carte

the ambience is really cool full marks to these guys for replicating goa in such a great way

the seafood variety is superb all in all this place is good for people who eat sea food the dj was also great we had loads of fun",4,
"goa in hyderabad these guys have cracked this juggernaut 

ambience  910
service  1010
food  drinks  910

if you love goa  this is the place to be in hyderabad no wonder they were packed on a weekday  wednesday",4,
excellent foodand amazing service by jamiruddin fishes are very fresh one must try their prawnslobsters and bebinca in short complete worth its price,5,
"been to this place 4 times the best in hyderabad for sea food and ambience service cost all worth it 1010 best of the best love it

we have ordered tandoori pomfret which was very fresh and perfectly cooked prawns excellently done not over cooked drums of heaven and heavenly main course was absolutely mouth watering food was served hot staff were very courteous anoop one of the staff was very helpful and kind

would recommend to families friends couples anyone who enjoys good food and ambience",5,
"i never knew i had such a great place near my home to chill out on weekends has really good beer non veg starters good ambience and quick service and the best sea food in hyderabad ",5,
very slow service it took us more than 25 hours just to have dinner totally disappointed with respect to the amount of money they are charging,2,
wonderful ambiance and staff were very pleasant the music and food was extraordinary good place to hangout with all office family and friends,5,
"the best restaurant to chill out but food was surely not up to the mark  chilly chicken too sweet  
they say 22 drinks but when you order cocktails they say it will not be applicable as they use 60 ml
in that  they should have told this before ordering  fish is too good ",4,
"every time iwe visit this place it never fails to amaze with lipsmacking food a 5 service with 5 food taste keep spreading love and warmth through your kitchen to our stomachs ",5,
this place is a paradise for seafood lovers especially it gives you the look and feel of the west coast the ambience is something you can get no where in hyderabad a goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too it is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money the look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise this place is for friends family and your loved ones they have good variety of appetisers their service is very friendly they do have valet and ample parking space i have visited this place twice and i am so in love with the food and the ambience,5,
"after so many recommendations we been there yesterday for couple of drinksthe ambience purely reflecting a typical goan bar i can say it is simply unique place in the city where you can sit and enjoy fresh air along with lite music  the staff where amazing i should thank specially mr dinesh mr rahul thanks for the suggestion on food and drinks your recommendations satisfied our pallets and bellys hehehe the quality of food and drinks where awesome the service was very prompt thanks to ashishzamirlalu and naveen who looked after our table  cheers guyz you people are rocking

"food 910
ambience 910
service 1010

a beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date the live music was a soulful experience even without it it had the right playlist the ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical romantic evening the music is light if you are interested in a good conversation the mutton roghan boti kebab was delectable the meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy the goan prawn curry was a delight too mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour the place has a kids play area too with those with children overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location i would definitely go back there for another amazing experience",5,
"good breezy sitting great food friendly staff the place is a must try for all seafood lovers the goa themed restaurant makes you miss goa the minute u enter the gate with a goa 0kms milestone

must try cafreal chicken for starters southern chicken

phata poster nikla hero noodles and blueberry cooler

parking ample

music not too loud but entertaining and lively

service super quick

seating ample and comfortable

served by mr ashish

dessert try the goan delicacy bibinca layered cake



visiting again definitely yes

thanks mr prajit and team",4,
"fisherman is wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in goa excellent food and bevs
then we moved to hyderabad fmw followed
we were so happy to have a goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home
in the beginning it was great place to dine then it started getting local fishes started getting stale fewer varieties not so great
now  after about 3 years it is more a typical curry point
we ordered mutton xacuti and kingfish richado
fish was so firm and overcooked richado overloaded with sweetness
mutton was out of the world with heaps of curry leaveskadi pattakaria paku  super high on heatreminded me of a rayala curry in dindi godavari distt  meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum i really thank myself for not ordering more
fisherman is wharf such a disappointment",1,
nice ambience and live band we have been visited with our family delicious food and nice cocktails had enjoyment time with nice sea food verites we like fish starter with spices and indian main course the service was nice by ashish komal and zamirthe cocktails taste good and boozy we all are happily enjoyed with our family,5,
i had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night while we were driving along the financial district road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work as we entered the place i was just mesmerized by the beachvibes that it was radiating the place was already full by 9pm but we could not resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood thereafter we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then the food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds i would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you goa trips,5,
"i went to this place with 7 friends the ambience is really nice the staff are polite n friendly we had good time here food is really nice ",5,
surprisingly well versed ambience the place is massive with a getawayfromcity feel they serve wonderfully cooked seafoodsgoan focused a tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages i would recommend to book table before hand there are variety of sit outs to choose from i would highly recommend this place if you are a seafood lover,4,
"visited with family wonderful ambiemce and live band nice food and service by ranvir teja kiran and mukul friendly and smily thank you guys we will vist again sure ",5,
"perfect for date nights

beautiful place with great food and amazing cocktails especially there raspberry liit is great options for both vegetarian and non vegetarians you can order anything from the menu and i can assure you it will be great the only set back is the service really slow just place your order in one go",4,
"been the place for lunch and i loved the ambiance over there which resembles the same as goa and the person who loves sea food will be attracted to this place ",4,
i love the ambience food is mouthwatering if you think you do not like coastal food do go here trust me food will get you there each time if you crave for sea food crowd is nice a peaceful place to be with friends or family do go there,5,
sea food cravings close your eyes and reach this place in hyderabad a very wide spread variety of sea food can not pen it here coz you have to visit here i have always been here for the love for 2 things crabs and only crabs it is a must try speciality of the restaurant the goan preparation made with recheado masalawould rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied thats the fun of it ambience awesome  staff too good feels homely love this restaurant more than anything 55 for everything,5,
a must visit for sea food lovers brings in goa to hyderabad would love to see more seating arrangements in the open area great food and lovely ambience a must visit  do not miss out on the simple yet amazing fish curry rice,4,
ambience is really good lot of space laid back ambience mist sprays  perfect for a lazy sunday lunch coming to food recommend trying only goan cuisine did not feel the buffet was special or so but their ala carte is real good sea devil is a starter that stands out  prawns wrapped in beacon perfectly grilled butter garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice  chicken vindalho if you are looking for spicy or chicken xacuti if you want something less hot,5,
"great ambience great food i would recommend the pan seared fish 
it is a little outside the city but the rooftop seating makes up for it",5,
"visited this place on saturday evening
had stuffed crab  fish starter chicken in goan style  was very spicystuffed chicken

in drinks we had bull frog drink was strong and tasted good

we went to have sea food here only one crab was available that is very big one 

ambience is nice i did not liked the food much
this place is very expensive also

overall not very happening place",3,
"a place with great ambience and good food here you pay for the experience which is great and rear
would love to visit the place again soon",4,
i had ordered gobi methi paratha it was ok not good it was too oily not much taste it tasted like it was a reheated paratha not fresh,3,
food was good but it was all leaking from the plate and so quantity was very less as compared and i expected rice as well with the thali but it was missing,3,
intially yesthe food was really good they were maintaining quality standard of food very wellwhich is rare in indian restaurant nowadays i do not see that happening thesetoday i have found hair my fit thaliwhich shows how much hygienic they are apart from this so many times i have seen they miss on cutlery or few items i mostly order fit thali so i know very well what it consist of not just one time so many time items are missing,3,
hyderabad is most worst and ugliest biryani i had yesterday from the restaurant eat fit and this worst restaurant people not allowing zomato people quick to the destination delivery points it has been 2hr late i have received from the biryani from eat fit just disguised about the biryani of the eatfit alaasss this is a horrible biryani i had ate in hyderabad,1,
very good at quality guyseven packaging is extraordinarybut chicken curry is not good which came more liquid with less tasteso quality quantity wise thumsupbut have to improve taste,4,
thank you so much for the excellent foodit tasted great price quality everything good i ordered via zomato online app delivery package was also greatif there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great,4,
"order no  1127326452

ordered rajma rice and what i received cold and badly smelly rotten food completely disappointed

and zomato is not even helpful to resolve it",4,
last time i ordered the foodtofu keema wrap dal makhni and parathe from here i was delivered spoiled food the wrap was literally smelling sour and parathe were like they have been prepared in the morning and sent to us for dinner i always order from this restaurant and since it was the first time i wanted to ignore this but still putting out this review so that management can introspect and figure out if this was process fault delivery fault or a manual one,1,
whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from it offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from indian continental oriental and even caribbean the food is prepared in a way that it is healthy but does not compromise on taste also the dishes are reasonably priced my only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly,4,
"i had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome healthy and tasty as well food quality was really very good i had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review i could not help myself fantastic keep it upp u have raised a bar do the good work always ",5,
i received food with a live green insect in it what food standards are being followed this is not expected from a restaurant with an excellent hygiene title,1,
zomato please help me to give them negative rating to this restaurant i fell sick after eating their roti how awful it is if your food not good your packaging will not give u business,1,
food was open,1,
"i ordered dal makhani with paratha  the parathas were good so soft and tasty dal makhani was okit was tasting some different but it was good ",3,
"very delicious millet and chicken dish
i feel so good ordering and eating from eatfit bc i can see the nutritional value and no where else i have found this yet i love that they give a mini free desert too  perfect sweet treat after a meal",5,
"till now ordered chef is special veg thali oat meal parantha in super breakfast
pros
 calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
 ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
 taste quality are great

now i felt few things can be improved
 delivery i felt it is slow and more than half an hour also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well
 plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
 price and quantity ratio  i felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing
eg oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds oats honey fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140 
 i strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20 so that they can get more orders and new customers to",4,
great food no oil soft rotis tasty gravy and juicy chicken it is a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals,5,
we have multiple options to have food but thinking about healthier options  there are very few i would like to appreciate all your effort to provide us an option to choose heathy and hygienic food great place to order healthy and tasty food,4,
very less quantity and food taste also not gud,1,
"ordered chef is veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome 3 rotis paneer curry which had so many paneer  salad dal makhani sweet everything was equally good and tasty ordered for the first time from this place and with all the discounts i paid just 61 for the food and got 50 as cashback
i totally loved it and would definitely order again

it was a good experience ordering food from this place
ps this experience is when i ordered from cult app later on when i order using zomato things were quite different like delivery was late no sweet",5,
ordered lunch from this place the taste was good food was not spicy or oily packing was good and quantity was sufficient i would prefer to order again,4,
"the food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavours
literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap
have u hv had this kind of feeling  

service was real quick comprising both order acceptence and delivery

suggestions
plz add cocktail onion with the meal
portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 34 of the brim

tu sum up this review i would say kuddos and you deserve ur brand name ",4,
they do not deliver your food they charge for food but may deliver only half of the order and when contacte zomato tell you that restaurant no is switched off strange are they in food delivery busines or this is something else beware,1,
i ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for zomato to deliver zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but i am never going to order from this restaurant also the food was below average i ordered tofu keema roll,1,
ordered a wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset the quality of food seemed really bad that time although i tried reaching out to zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eatfit team will get back till date i have not received any response from either zomato or eatfit,1,
hey guys i ordered chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this was not a good experience at allthe only plus point can be given for good packaging but packaging does not count as we pay for good food the biryani did not even taste like a biryani it was more like fried rice with chicken dumped  had a very bad experience,1,
if you want to eat something delicious without feeling guilty about eating unhealthy food then eatfit is your go to place delicious tofu keema parantha having no extra spice is and perfect balance of flavors,5,
"for the first time tried the light lunch meal from eatfit which has 450kcal as mentioned

decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil chapatis were homely soft and warm something a bit hard to get in hyderabad a less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier not sure if i would order this again but could maybe try their salads",3,
"why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry unless the buyers are fools
terrible pricing and quantity for the money
2 stars just for decent taste of curry
all those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can not have sufficient food inside
oh boy will never try 

btw the dish name is chefs special nonveg thali ",2,
forgot to give spoon and tissues,3,
"worst food  i would never order from this again i ordered lucknowi biryani  that turned out bullshittt it looked like timato chutney rice ",1,
eat healthy eatfit tried their nutty dates pudding and detox smoothie both were very good and it is good to have healthy food like these,5,
we ordered 1 luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees the taste was okay strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani but i have not had lucknow biryani before so can not really judge how it exactly supposed to taste,3,
ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me by bread omelette i was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate omelette tasted good bread was plain and hard there were only two normalmedium sized roasted potato wedges it tasted ok along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato english style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down this was a major let down there was rajma type curry which tasted ok this whole dish was out of the way,2,
delivery boy was reluctant to the deliver the order and was unable to navigate the maps he reached to different location and when i was trying to navigate him he said he do not know the address which was mentioned,1,
dal tadka awesome rajma chawal soso too garlicky,4,
food arrived wonderfully packed  i ordered an omelette for breakfast and in the tray were also some beans small portions of bread potato wedges and roasted tomatoes  a very pleasant eating experience  though the omelette and sides were slightly cold upon arrival  i might add  for 160 rupees including delivery  the meal was an exceptional value,5,
ordered the breakfast combo from zomato the taste was good and simple feels just like home made food and healthy too the breakfast combo had a breadbun omelette grilled tomato and sidecurry kinda  for the bun,3,
i ordered from this place from zomato the amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant i ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes the juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml the potato flakes nothing more than normal haldiram mixture i am definitely not ordering next time,1,
"a 35

well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks

so i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their chicken keem paratha wrap its was oily and tasted ok not bad at all it tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus

yes it came with sugar honey coated peanuts and some green chutney am not sure how it makes up the diet fit but yes a nice concept though",3,
"great hygienic and health food good packing
all the ingredients look and taste fresh more importantly you get what you see
i hope they maintain the veg non veg segregation
a little expensive",5,
"food quality and quantity is not up to mark a family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 rs and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less no raita or salan given not at all worth for money
quality is also not very good did not feel anything great about  worst place to order food sorry however that is the reality thanks",1,
i found a small wooden stick in the tofu keema wrap i ordered from eatfit apparently not so hygenic and healthy as they claim themselves to be,1,
an easy choice everyday among so many others for dinner not only is the food tasty hygienic and healthy their services discounts and the entire cure fit package is just amazing and a well deserved hype success,5,
"i had ordered veg pulav and egg masala bowl no egg and no taste pulav have no vegetables even restaurant took 1 hour to give it to the delivery boy this is ridiculous ",1,
ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again it is very delicious i see that this time different type of oatswheat based are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher like the combination of oats sabza seeds and milk  the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear cranberries besides apple dates pomegranate,5,
have ordered from here multiple times but today the food was not up to standards ordered chef is special combo for 2 the salad and raita smelled bad werent fresh had to throw them away you folks have made a name stick to its standards,2,
"had ordered veg pulao  rajma it did not seem fresh  however i consumed it  could not sleep whole night because of vommiting  loose motion
will never order food from eatfit again",1,
"super delicious nutty dates pudding simple dish made with wheat milk natural sweetener jaggerygud it was topped with almonds dates kishmish there was no cashew nuts as specified in menu else would have rated 5
pomegranate protect was simply amazing one can feel raw pomegranate coconut juice satisfied with quantity for both itemsbought on zomato offer",4,
"fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing surprisingly it is not what typical oatmeal bowls are oats soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear apple pomegranate dates and mint leaves superb taste enough for a person
all eatfit drinksjuices are amazing and so was guava glow could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon the pepper was unidentifiable in juice",5,
less quantity,5,
"really healthy and tasty food quantity is a bit at the lower end for the given price hence expensive

would recommend dal chawal the sweet they as complimentary are really good should try to reduce plastic use in packaging as they are heavy on it due to marketing stunts",4,
quantity too less for a meal,3,
"ordered chicken thali for two from here loved the effort they put in packaging and attaching printed labels of your name to the food
a wholesome meal for two it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each daal chicken gravy raita salad pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar
a healthy alternative to oustide food if you are working out  enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well",4,
not valued for money,4,
i strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories i would suggest eatfit to look after the quantitybecause i think it is very little with this price tag apart from this everything is extraordinary like packing presentationquality etcall the best eatfit,4,
i have ordered kachori  chana chaat for home delivery from zomato i was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eatfit  previously ordered food quality being good as soon as i opened the box bad smell was coming then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori is the chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori is were also smelling bad i had to throw away everything i do not think i can order again with trust on their food quality,1,
"dates tea cake was good i was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates it was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier
topped with chia seeds the lemon tea cake was surprising as i could feel cinnamon it was slightly oily at first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake
these cakes are wheat based just as described which is a good thingthough the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes i wish it could have been more just as shown in cult fit website",3,
"health consciously designed menu and quality food packing is also very nice
keep up the good work  provides you a daily dose of health taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast lunch or dinner",5,
"eatfit is is the next level service witch can offer you the basic and simple food with all required proteins calories and energy and their packing is awesome ",5,
"totally love the food the food tastes great is not fried oily or too spicy just the way i like it has helped me check my weight also thank you what would i have done for my everyday lunch without you ",5,
i ordered tofu keema paratha and it was really good with the right measurable quantity of healthy and delicious food the food was perfectly packed,5,
the taste was ok and food seems healthy for the prices that we have the quantity is way less does not fill half your stomach overpriced worthless,2,
chicken was goodmix veg is very sweetand small roties,3,
"eatfit you beauty 

if there is one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong it has to be eatfit outlets

i have ordered tofu burji and lacha paratha for breakfast this morning there was also yummy tomato chutney apart from burji

if you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free tasty and with great packing it has to be this place

eatfit provides you a daily dose of health taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast lunch or dinner

i never ever ever knew healthy food can be so tasty

order now",5,
ordered this delicious healthy dish  massaman veg curry and thai rice bowl loved it curry is so smooth and contains everything as described in the eatfit menu,5,
"everybody is talking about eat fit these days i was curious to know what is causing so much buzz so i ordered chef is special veg thaliit contained 3 wheat flour rotis paneer ki sabzi daal makhni salad pickle and a healthy dessert

i really liked the way the daal makhni tasted it was tough to believe that it did not contain butter
paneer ki sabzi also tasted good the paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger

but i would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut the cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch also i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot

overall if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape eat fit is a great choice you get calorie count proteincarbfat count you can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout daysrest days accordingly

it is great to see that people are so health conscious now eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution hope they keep inspiring us ",4,
very poor food and my items were missing,1,
i had ordered chilly chicken hakka noodles it taste good chicken pieces are well seasoned and juicy iam impressed with the presentation taste would have much better it not taste like real chinese cuisine but i recommend to try atleast once,3,
"healthy food calls for eatfit good packing and decent food price is a bit on the higher side
rotis could have been better will definitely order more from here",4,
avoid this place is a scam if there is even a place i cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address anyway i ordered a healthy chicken breast dish they claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos then you get regular oily fatty suspiciouslysaucy indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand the only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion no wonder it is low on calories you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites there were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it maybe 25gr total submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce i doubt it was even grilled it looked and tasted more like it was fried although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows the picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only plus the sides on other plates i should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but i was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food at least it was not too expensive but definitely not healthy not cheap and not good quality food,1,
can you explain how spicy food is healthy in addition to this the chapatis were super dry and both vegetables were tasteless not worth the wait and money of course,1,
the food was amazingly delicious i ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious,5,
"i wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around gachibowli i did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eatfit was my saviour this was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in india few reasons why eatfit is better than other places 

1 they do not use any processed ingredients 
2 they do daily sourcing of veggies  meats  that is the real secret for the consistent taste 
3 they use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4 no maida no sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5 daily cooking they cook a limited number of portions 
and there are various other reasons as well 

the calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the indian meals are very tasty especially their no cream dal makhni nilgiri chicken hyderabadi chicken mangalorean chicken kashmiri chicken tawa subzi paneer gravy in chefs special veg thali to mention a few not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day the healthy desserts smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos wheat chicken momos chicken baida roti are filling these help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening

the only downside for me is that it is a zomato exclusive and zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery they promise to deliver the food any time between 30 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour by the time food arrives it is already cold which i hate personally this happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location the algorithm being used by zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless zomato needs to check this and also eatfit management also should take some actions against zomato they have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on zomato exclusivity many customers are disappointed 

verdict

overpriced crap on the name of healthy food the food industry has become a dark business nowadays looting customers on the name of healthy food quantity is too less at the price they sell,1,
i have been wanting to have food from this place since a while as it had a good rating and reviews as well and the main thing here is healthy food unlike the other restaurants were we wouldnt even know how many calories we are consuming and i was thrilled to order food from this place so i ordered vegetable pulao brownrice and egg white masala curry and let me tell you it tasted yum and the packing was excellent damn i guess i am gonna be quite regular in ordering food from here now,5,
"excellent food everytime i order just love the way they present their food and the freshness nd nutrition it has perfect food place for fitness freaksss keep up the same honest work you give
kudos",5,
you need to improve your packing had ordered veg thai green curry with rice by the time it was delivered to me curry had splashed all over the container  even leaking from package zomato delivery person said it leaked while getting it had second thoughts abt whether to consume it or not,1,
"it is really difficult to get tasty healthy food eatfit is kinda solving this problem food quantity is good display of nutritional facts made me happy i know what i am eating and can plan my day if following a diet

ordered chicken peanut curry  woktossed millet bowl gravy tasted good with mix of veggies quality of chicken in the gravy is less than normal portion millers were kinda dryoverall good experience for me",4,
great place to order decent food have ordered dinner from them on multiple occasions the taste is definitely great  especially their exotic chicken dishes the indian menu is also very satisfying have developed a deep liking for their date pudding it is great comfort food the food is not oily and does not leave you feeling bloated,5,
the berry blast smoothie tasted very good could actually feel the taste of papaya watermelon blueberriesetc and can even make them out the quantity was a big disapointment the bottle was thin as well the smoothie was finished in few gulps,4,
taste is not good and also not freshly prepared it seems food was cooked at afternoon and delivered during evening for dinner also not spicy,1,
"highly recommend this place the entire menu is so captivating and pleasing at the same time with a thought left in your mind that yay do not worry you are eating healthy and the food literally looks healthy no excess oil no hints of butter etc it is simply delicious and perfect i tried dal makhni paneer curry masala chaach and tofu keema wrap all were fantastic in order of my mention ",5,
i ordered thai chicken rice first of all it is on the expensive side second the quantity was not good third it was spicy seems like they are spending more on fancy packaging than the actual food,2,
not tasty,3,
"i have ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl and it was delicious and it contains green apple and basil seeds and pomogranate and banana and also dates its the most healthiest diet that one could ever have in an affordable priceit tastes delicious and oats taste good if you are on diet and want to choose a perfect oat meal this is the best one that you have ever asked for keep it up guys ",5,
i have ordered for one item oat meal and received another item ghar rasma veg pulao which is not satisfactory and wastage of food and money,1,
it said thali but not adequate quantity,2,
an awsumm place where u can order variety of healthy food strongly recommended to try everything on the menu as it is healthy fresh and hygienic everytime its ordered u dont have to worry about the caloriesevery dish comes properly labelled with it is nutritional value so you know what you are having,4,
ordered the paneerdal combo for 2 people it comes well packed in a big box the quantity of the food is great 3 chapatis for a person raita dal makhni paneer salad pickle and super food supplement we also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake so in terms of quantity a 55 coming to the taste  the paneer was soft the curry was well cooked and was tasty dal was decent probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind wasnt high on spices or oil the curd was fresh and good in taste as well loved the over all parcel,5,
"dear eatfit  what on earth charging you 180  for this 3 rotis 2 spoons of veg curry enough dal and little salad with spoon of raita
i am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness

3 star is for taste and quality but quantity does not even meet expectations
very poor",3,
"i ordered from eatfit and sorry to say the food was at all not good both taste and quantity were below my expectations
the food i ordered was masala egg curry with vegetable pulao with order id 1676056120

zomato delivery guy when delivered i realized that curry was spilling from the box when enquired he said this is packaging problem
after zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eatfit seems to be not bothered 
after opening the box the food was just half a bowl rice taste seems to be of very low quality bad service from eatit and from zomato

my first and last order from eatfit already uninstalled zomato  overall very unpleasant experience",1,
quality of food and packing is good quantity is less in the bowl my advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity will not be sufficient for an individual,5,
great food came up with neatly packed and the delivery person was handled the package with care and delivered on time thanks to zomato to be a partner with this kind of great restaurant around us eatfit is unbelievable and marvellous food making and packing,5,
"this restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web page
and after a long hard work i found one contact through zomato customer service which was also wrong
this shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurant
they have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact number
moreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from them

poor show

i would give a half star

horrible experience with eatfit",1,
"ambiencena
service na
food very tasty and healthy dry fruit laddu is best part of athletic meal
matar patti with tomato curry is very tasty soft rich flavour of tomatoes enhanced the tast even more

dal makhani with parata

i had lachha paratha and chettinad chkn lachha paratha was cold and was very hard to chew for the amount you guys are charging i expected a better experience,2,
"eat fit  name itself suggest healthy food
i have ordered it from zomato and the delivery was quick
i ordered veg paneer keema paratha and lucknowi biryani packaging was good and food was hot
paratha was delicious it was flooded with lots of paneer and finely chopped veggiesit is healthy and tasty too

loved their lucknowi biryani too veggies were coated with delicious spicesand that aroma was soo goodthey served raita and salan which was tasty too

"the biryani here is very delicious one should must have this biryani if they visit hyderabad you will compare all but this tops the chart in satisfaction ",4,
i have ordered khabooz normal which is with saladi liked the portion size very much i have never seen that much portion size in any other shawarma outletit was very much for me the taste was also goodwould like to try their other shawarma is,4,
was surprised to know that sg runs a shawarma hub too all thanks to sg biryani is which made me order chicken special rumali shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it the delivery packaging taste and quantity was perfect trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy it came without vegetables and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end it is always best to have little extra mayo,4,
"i ordered their special chicken shawarma from zomato first look it was quite heavy for one shawarma the quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a qualityit is not at all good the chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also it usually stays open late night but do not order from here stillthe quality needs to improve a lot
stay healthy keep eatingnot from here
cheers",2,
super taste and packing was nice this is one of my favourite food and we had with friends everyone gave same rating we enjoyed a lot thanks zomato,5,
i bought food from them twice rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma both were good and tasty i liked the libby shawarma more and the rumali was also good but libby better the rumali was fat shawarma means the shawarma was mota the only concern i had was there was a lot of coriander leaves i should have given instructions the taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well totally i am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well,5,
"delivery review 

ordered a chicken rumali shawarma

the chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew

also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy

overall it was okayish

had to throw away half of it as both rumali and the chicken were very chewy

giving 2 star because they did not add mayo as requested

overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city",2,
shawarama from this place is like heaven  no doubt we enjoy every bite from it  try dry fruit chicken shawarama for sure  thanks zomato and shah house for such mouthwatering dishes,5,
while i am eating my food i get this in my food the steel wire it cut my tongue inside the worst experience while having my food i am suggesting do not buy shawarma from shah ghouse,1,
delicious and timely delivery dont miss the roomali shawarmas im on a business trip to hyderabad and this shawarma kept me company while i worked into the night,5,

"had tried chicken shawarma lukmi samosa veg puff egg and chicken puff
chicken shawarma was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok it tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark overall did not meet my expectations

both lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation just the shape was different better to go for samosa instead of lukmi the taste was ok though

comming to the puffs all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery not a big fan of these",3,
"some pieces of chicken are totally uncooked raw and important thing i had ordered for two shawarmas and i got only one i do not know what went and whose fault it is
one who delivered he was saying that you had ordered only one when i spoke with the person of hotel who answered my call said that it may be delivery boys fault
seems that no value for customer queries",1,
not very pleasant experience with shawarmas here was very tasty but got hard time digesting unpleasant burps until took medicine and it was not only me but my friend also experienced same,2,
"as in the name the shawarma is truly special and it is more than the money it costs tastes heaven delivery is quick as well
so it is the right thing to order if you want some tasty chicken to kill your hunger",5,
i tried 5 highest rating shawarma places in hyderabad and this is the best  most filling place simply amazing the special rumali is the best,5,
i ordered a chicken rumali shawarma just now from this place and added instructions in my order not to put that slimy greasy mayonnaise some of these places are famous for lo and behold  opening the food parcel was the item with the awful slimy sickening mayo i had requested not to be added  and i might add  there was only meat and mayo  no vegetables such as included in shawarma ordered from better places this was listed as special shawarma,2,
the dry fruit shawarma is awesome and every time i have ordered two for my self and i have finished as well the only hotel i love in entire hyderabad is shah ghouse,5,
"one of the best places where one can visit to taste shawarmas and can get easily addicted just in love with your chicken malai special hands down ",5,
"best shawarma near gachibowli affordable and worth every penny delivery valet was also very customer friendly
really enjoyed every bite",5,
i must say i did not expect much after trying a few so called famous shwarma shops in hyderabad but i think this one equalled if not bettered istah shawarma house the chicken pieces were cooked amazingly well loved the cream packaging could have been better,4,
the shawarma roll had uncooked meat i got pieces of bones too i am very much disappointed with shah ghouse spl shawarma the quantity may be sufficient enough but quality matters more if uncookedit is good for nothing,1,
excellent to taste,5,
late delivery almost after 30 mins,1,
it was not the same like before there were big big pieces of chicken instead of cutting them into smaller pieces,2,
good for late night cravings,5,
authentic biriyani must try the platters its an old and good brand the service is not up to the mark given their confidence that people will come no matter how they treat customers the food will cool you down even if their behavior is not good overall okay experience,3,
ordered special rumali chicken shawarma was delivered uncooked chicken with a soggy rumali roti not worth the name never ever gonna order,1,
very spicy shawarma not for people like who do not eat spicy based on rating went to try but it was very spicy could not finish it and ended up having upset stomach,2,
delicious shawarmas i tasted over here so try here once in life time  especially i like samoli and khaliooz rumali is not so good nice nice,4,
never seen any place that is so unhygienic and dirty place is so dirty i have no words never seen anything like this not sure how people order and eat here,1,
yesterday i ordered dry fruit shawarma from this restaurant nd it disturbed my stomach so much at olden days it was so good but now they are giving worst shawarma i instructed to add extra mayonnaise but there is no minimum mayonnaise also chicken is so hard to eat cant eat iti informed about this to zomato they are not responding nd either restaurant not responding dont try shawarma here nd ruin ur health,1,
one of my chauffeur in hyderabad recommended this place for authentic persian food and i was disappointed this place did not live upto the fame and name the meat wasnt well cooked the taste was bland the service was fast however the quality of service was a disappointment a cold finger bowl at the end made it worst ambiance 05 service 255 staff 355 food 15 value for money 155,2,
this place promises to be one of the good shawarma outlets in gachibowli drive down there for shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles so sit back and order online my order contained 1 shah ghouse chicken special rumali shawarma and i have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more filled with hummus and the chicken was just cooked right it is surely at par with the shawarma served at shahi dastarkhwan lakdi ka pul the search for a still better shawarma continues my 5 star rating is still pending for the best shawarma,4,
i did not expect like this from shahghouse 1st time sharwarma with bunand it is spl and on the cover it s g is shahghouse or another doing on your name in onlineplease check and do better,1,
for the first time when i has shawarma here it was great and thought of ordering it again but the issue with these kind of places is that they just serve good food until they are famous and once done the quality descends drastically the best shawarma i had is at sk shawarma dlf and other opposite to food bazar nizampet,1,
chicken taste is not good,2,
was a great having one of the best shawarmaeverything was just as perfect as it could have beenand specially try the the one shawarma with that malai onethat is the yummiest,5,
i ordered chicken shawarma it is a worst experience the chicken gets spoiled and smells we threw it away very worst experience stay away from this restaurant,1,
not a great one and not a bad one either can try it once the packaging isnt great and it spill off easily give a try but dont expect too much,3,
one of the besstt places to order shawarma this is a shah ghouse chicken special rumali shawarma the chicken is so tender and juicy the spicy shawarma with mayomalai hits right on your taste buds the quantity is filling and overwhelming i love this place and i do recommend this place to all my non veg lover friends great quality  quantity of food keep it up  wish i could give more than 5 stars,5,
"i ordered chicken shawarma from here suaces got leaked completely as you can see in pics packing was badzomato delivery was so late i do not it is mistake of shah ghouse or zomato delivery executive i thrower that shawarma bcz of it
generally we get best shawarmas here but i had very bad experience of packing and delivery executive",1,
excellent taste no replacement for shahghouse shawarma quantity is worth no delay in delivery with unique taste try once and without any doubt you will addict,5,
ordered malai shawarma it was very tasty and mainly not spicy but when ordered for 2nd time it was very spicy but overall it is good and one of the best places to taste shawarma in hyderabad,4,
"this is a restaurant provides a lovely juicy tasty spicy shawarma 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice i did not do that though

"every foodie i met in hyderabad recommended this shawarma i had just started loving the one from istah is but i am up for a new challenge my friend ordered one and we shared it was awesome it was spicy and tasty then i ordered one myself but i ordered the one with salad what a slap in the face i came with cucumbers and almonds what the rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle nevertheless i liked the shawarma it is not the best but it is in the high ranks
edit 1 yesterday i went to shah ghouse again i really wanted to try the special shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion to be honest i was blown it is the best shawarma i have ever had the meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much i relished every single bite take a bow shah ghouse",4,
if u look at the they make it u wont even try it but once u try it u wont forget it its aswum place is dirty and lack cleanliness and hygiene but taste is really gud and pocket friendly too,4,
shawarma here is the best it tastes different from every other shawarma joint the way the chicken taste is just amazing do not know about biryani but if you are looking for an amazing shawarma experience you must try this,4,
"a very popular shop nearby the hotel i was staying in gachibowli just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big shah ghouse complex housing the restaurant pan shop tea shop and this shawarma joint 

lot of crowd and filled with online orders delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas amidst all this rush i ordered for a special rumali chicken shawarma for rs 120 got it in a jiffy and i have not had much shawarmas before
 
this was absolutely delicious and filled with chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise sauces etc i guess i checked out the reviews here beforehand and i told them to make it less spicy do not be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling  a somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack",4,
best shawarma place in hyderabad quality and taste is too good eat to have best shawarma in hyderabad go to shah house very rush during night time,5,
the best shawarma you can have is here the quantity and the quantity both are awesome one shawarma is enough in terms of dinner or lunch i always prefer to have from this place,4,
food is good,5,
worst taste i ever had,1,
ordered special chicken shawarma rumali and special chicken shawarma samoli the taste is amazing and the quantity is also good and sufficient for one person the online order facility is only available through zomato giving minus 1 for oil and the amount of spice as the shawarma is oily and spicy but it is taste awesome feedback for this great place would be to make it a little bit less spicy,4,
goid service,5,
"waah kya shawarma man

really succulent chicken sweet flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti this is a fullsized dinnerreplacement wrap that is bangon with the flavours the only shawarma in the twincities worth craving for do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life let it be this and thank me later
ps the chicken is on the spicier side though",5,
"rating 355
although very little resemblance with the lebanese shawarma wrap the rumali roti shawarma tasted good the wrap has good quantity of chicken stuffings and the sauce was good too but once again the chicken was quite spicy so if you are looking for healthy food this shawarma is not your call very fast delivery",3,
shawarma is not tasty need to improve in taste,2,
wrong item received,1,
shawarma was really good and full of chicken but but but chicken was too much roasted and there was lack of mayonnaise which should be increase to make it feel like juicy,4,

chicken inside the shawarma got spoiled and smelling too once opened it and was smelling spoiled before ordering only i thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time but due to the trust on shah ghouse ordered it and initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it i last order i thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday i ordered shawarma and he repeated the same food quality in shah ghouse getting bad day by day,1,
"man this place hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill eat and drink
the food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite part
we tried almost everything on the menu perks of zomato gold and nothing really was a disappointment
the place looks amazing and has a cost feel they have a setup on the balcony from where the view is just amazing",4,
best place to be to hangout with your loved ones  ambience and taste of food one no need to comprise on that friendly staff staff sandip very humble and understands your taste worth being there good value for money,5,
the fisrt time i came here fell in love with the ambience the food is good and priced nominally sandeep was so helpful in choosing the right choice of food  drinks,5,
my peace of advice pls do not waste your money over pricy but buffet spread has very less items very much disappointed and the food was not even hot,1,
had visited for lunch buffetto my surprise at 2 pm most of the dishes were hardly left and were not replenisedalso service is slow had to wait even to pay bill inspite of the fact that it was half occupiedhad much more expectations for that price rangedefinitly not value for money,2,
food was not that great just ambience was good very very conjusted sofa area worst ac service was good but i dnt recommend this place for food,1,

"visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and i must say one of the best places to party in and around kondapur the place is huge and divided into 3 sections interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony
if you ask me can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony my favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day
when it comes to food
first dish was 
green veg galouti  mince of green packed with galouti masala onion  cashew paste and smoked with clovelaung the kebabs are so soft that they just melt in mouth
 achari daal croquette  achar flavoured daal puree rolls coated with panko crumbs and deep fried and the tomato chutney served with it just enhance the taste
moong daal cheese chilla  minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa it was decent
chole bathure  the chutney was so good served with potato curry
 galouti is are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and mutton galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal
had few mocktails but my pick was kiwi based mocktail full marks for the presentations
chicken tikka this can never go wrong it was very good
chicken taco  will make it simple just loved it
heard alot about desserts next visit will be desserts will keep you posted friends 
over all the experience was good interior might not be the best looking one still looks decent but the balcony i must say fell in love with that area",4,

of course a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chapbecause it aint mentioned on the menuand there is a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest

experience
incredible in one wordtoo good a musical festplenty of area be it by the table or at the floor for comfortably dancingdrinks enhanced the italian experienceand it is a must visit place when the hangout is with saturdayish buddies",5,
very nice and cozy place with good ambience food was also great staff was also courterous we were served by sandeep who happened to be a really polite and gentle person overall i would highly recommend the place,5,
good place to hangout and party place is for party lovers can enjoy good food watch ipl and music  staff is polite  zomato gold is accepted,4,
the overall experience was good just one thing i particularly did not like it and it was tacos rest the order the ambience was really good,4,
"shame on the management do not even consider the regular customer benfit please do close it shame on you ppl please do not visit hyper local any time ",1,
"i and my friend went here to watch the ipl live screening and have some good time one good thing was that they have 22 on drinks through zomato gold the food pretty decent too but what i did not like was that it did not have good options in drinks especially nonalcoholic we eventually went for masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad we asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldnt take it back was not happy with the service

also the live music there was not great",3,
"love to be here again
 the way nitish has done a job
cant express in words
i recommend each  everyone to have a great time
here
thanks nitish for giving your valuable experience with us",5,
all services delayed menu changes very limited options in snack and food when asked they say it is menu from delhi and can not help inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table asked for french fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in ok last one came finally when the manager arrived after being aggressive they want to offer free drinks but it is not about money but experience will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back,1,
"this was my second visit to the place and i am very disappointed for the following reasons

1 the first time i visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue

i dicided to give it another shot and came again

2 ordered cheese chilli toast never order it it is as hard a a rock cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3 ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4 dj was pathetic it was supposed to be bollywood hangover he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter is ear let alone having a conversation with your friends

ps if you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good dj you need feel the pulse of audience",2,

just have been here for a team lunch  they said they offer buffet and when we sit to eat  it is just one non veg starter and two veg starters  when we enquire they say that sandwich is a starterlol  and even the starters look like prepared for breakfast and served for lunch  would never ever recommend this place for buffet  worst experience would have given 0 rating if it existed,1,
i really want to give nill rating but i couldnt because zomato doesnt provide option please note that this is the second time i went to hyper local1st time was my engagement party in feb2019 and we loved everything about the restaurant be it servicefood quality ambiencei strongly insisted my friends for office party so we went on may1stwe took buffet and that was the worst decision that we tookfirstly there was no foodwe requested multiple times to refill but they didnt at allnextservice was tooooo poor they were not even respondingno platesno bowlsfood quality was worsewhatever the left over food they have in the bowl were not hotnote that i went at 130pm to restaurant fullyy disappointed for coming and wasting our day out,1,
it was an awesome experiencethe staff specially nitish was really kind and attentive food and beverage was really nice thanks for the great experience,5,

"pathetic experience i have had in recent times arrived for buffet at 2pm i saturday afternoon the food was cold as ice no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers

the only thing that was severed as per it is level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience

until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold

later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience

will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option

really disappointed",1,

my favourite seating was outdoor from where you can see the breathetaking view of greenary sky and sunset  the best view while having our food i soo loved it i completely had a pleasant view and seen some peacocks as well

delhi is famous local street food in hyderabad

hyper local has a fusion of modern yet local dishes which makes every foodie a must place to visit

they recently launched summer special cocktails which will blow your mind with there innovative ideas
starting off with

thyme of your life  it is seriously a thyme in you are life this drink is as refreshing as u take a nice gentle massage your mood replenishes and keeps your day refreshed it is actually a gin based cocktail topped with thyme which has a strong aromatic flavour of spices

the green lantern before one can think it as smoky melon but as soon as it arrives u get to know it is made with the green apple and green peas puree with a dash of vodka comes out in new soothing effect

pirate punch the presentation is very pleasing it looks as a giant
drink of cocktail but it has its own dressing of pirate look inside the glass the drink is a bacardi rum based with the combination of indian herbs which just spice is up your palate and yes this drinks is also healthy

blood diamond bloody maryis a drink for the people who likes to make their own cocktail it is actually a four different types of test tube which has a portion of tabasco worcestershire sauce tomato juice lime juice vodka which is poured out in a jar and shake it off really well and it is ready this drink had very pungent tangy flavour and just a tease of mustard can be know

golden trumpet beer cocktail the beer is poured into a truck shaped container which is very appealing to see and tastes spicer along with a zest of herbs


coming towards the food hyper locals most popular dishes
vegetarian
chole bhature  one of the most popular dishes in delhi region it is a must dish to opt for the bhature here are thick and fluffy with is perfect for dipping in the chole along with aloo in its side is very satisfying dish one should have here

aloo tikki chat  another dish which is also very popular in delhi region this tikka had good chunks of aloo in it with a beautiful presentation everyone will surely want it

achari daal croquette this crispy golden brown croquette have a savoury flavour tastes best with mayonnaise along with green chutney my recommendation

moong daal cheese chilla this pancakes made with moong dal stuffed with cheese is great option for breakfast and lunch

chole calzonethis italian folded pizza has an indianised version of chole inside with the combination of chole and cheese brings out a tastyful delight

nonvegetarian
mutton galouti kabab an dish which needs no explanation it is a signature dish which has ample amount of spices in the minced meat it just melts in your mouth as butter melts on heat the presentation of the dish a top notch

shahi malai tikka this dish is milkier version of chicken tikka the chicken is drenched on a mixer of cream  yoghurt  cheese  ginger and garlic paste then heat it on grill it is mostly more milder than spicy version

chicken tikka the chicken is well dressed in spices and grilled it was very spicy than compared to the shahi version

all the above dishes are unique in its own

totally recommend  chole bhature my choice

"review 

recently we have received an invitation from hyper local it is on the 3rd or top floor of sln terminus gachibowli just next to platinum cinemas the place is located in a good open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer and if you go there before sunset you can enjoy the dawn the ambiance is pretty good with

full bar

nightlife

live music

private dining area available

wifi

live sports screening

indoor seating

smoking area

buffet

if you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues this is the perfect place their food is pretty good with reasonable price i find the prices are on the lower side than any other nearby cafes

they are serving ipl live screening with bucket bonanza where you can get 4 pints of beer including a vegnonveg starter but you need to remember the entry is restricted to adults no kids allowed

anyway yesterday i went to keep the invitation it was around 615 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday i asked to serve their specialty so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail first they served lsd which is a kickoff cocktail made with 5 types of liqueur like gin vodka tequila rum  triple sec and made with freshly squeezed orange juice triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter  sweet oranges and with the use of fresh orange juice the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well i was eagerly waiting for the mocktail thought of trying the nonalcohol drink first then the cocktail the mocktail was served along with chicken taco

the mocktail was made with fresh kiwi  mint the flavor of fresh ingredients were significant made the drink so refreshing usually in bars they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice

after that i tried their chicken taco those tacos were made for indians so you can not get the blunt taste but the real fusion works here those tacos were stuffed with indian spiced grilled chicken and topped with mint raita and served in malabar ghee fried parotas taste wise they were so good but the only thing which bothered me the malabar parota as the parotas have layers so it was difficult to hold the entire thing so i suggested to use plain wheat fourmaida tortillas i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken and yes the tacos were too filling i could have only 2 of them

now it is time for the cocktail which was literally inviting me to taste it and believe me it was kicking offso strong but nice orange flavored  very refreshing i could only finish the 34th of the entire portion

the stuff were insisting me to try something else on food i left it on them so they suggested me to try their signature dish chicken sambousek what is that that is baharat spiced chicken keema cooked  folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried served with 3 types of dip mayo mint raita  sweet tamarind  saffron chutney i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney it went so well together

now you might be wondering what baharat spice is as per the chef the word baharat actually means spices in arabic and not a single spice but a blend of several spices in this blend you can find black pepper coriander paprika cardamom nutmeg cumin cloves and cinnamon so the chicken keema was cooked with these spices though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa but the taste was very different and that is why the 3 different types of dips were served

i felt the food quality  quantity is quite enough  satisfactory as per price definetly overall 45 out of 5

already written about the ambiance  5 out of 5

location is also easy to reach  45 out of 5

service was a professional  efficient  5 out of 5

as per my experience young people have a great option for a bar cum restaurant which serves both quanlity  quantity of food  dink on reasonable price with nightlife  live screening  beautiful ambiance",5,
they have worst north indian food i believe spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food but other than that chinese and continental was good their safe sex on beach deink is great just,3,
"monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have got being screened then things get better yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of got i had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails yes they have a new menu for that to try now they are fancier than you are 

i ordered for  blood diamond bloody mary to start with which was different when they added dijon mustard you can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail the bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving my next cocktail was thyme of your life well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice now this drink actually gives you a kick  in first sip itself the   peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste i would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink coming on to the food after going through the menu for a long time i finally ordered the indianised version of pasta fusili in kasuri methi and coriander sauce the name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce it was full of medium size diced veggies like zucchini bell peppers broccoli and  mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread  

it was good experience on my first visit the staff was courteous polite and very patient with their guests overall i would like to rate it 45 you should definitely try this place for hangouts",4,
amazing place and best to chill out with friendsspecially the outdoor ambience we simply loved it as well as the food was also nice and along with the service,5,
"food is delicious and great hospitality too by sandeep would recommend others to come over here and taste the delicious dishes and friendly staff thanks all of you ",5,
nice place to hang out food was really good as well as drinks ambience and music was really goodloved the dj for friday night worth visiting the place,4,
as here the food was good and they serve all the cusines chinese north and hyderabadi and buffet the chinese dishes were delicious compared to others can go with friends for hangout,4,
"went on a saturday night it was ladies night i enjoyed the feel ambience music and dance floor i wish there could be a better system for ladies night rather than queuing up across bar counter n shouting to be heard amongst over enthusiastic young ladies pushing you around
feel was just right n music was bomb danced till we drop",4,
pizza is goodnice staffambiance good but better to visit night time to see the beauty of lightsplace is very quiet during day time,4,
excellent drinks and some great starters suggested by the courteous staff superb ambience must visit for all and come long with family to have some good time,5,

i visited the place last week the food was tasty and so was ambience but i have serious concern with the services

we asked for regular water  and they brought dirty stinky water just to sell the bottled water the waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free

it was highly irresponsible
also we had to literally beg them to bring the cheque

please train your staff if you want to ",2,
"nice place for hangout and sevice was too great n server nitish is treat like as friend
and his suggestions is very amazing  so plz meet him before service",5,
amazing place to chill live music and ambience is up to the mark food is fine they should include some options in mocktails and drinks overall a good place to hangout with friends,4,
one place to order pasta when you are hungry in office also stomach filling with two toasted breads if your hungry want to order something quickly without scrolling down much just order it and wiat for the food,3,
menu needs a major overhaul not for a large group of people not for everyone due to limited items in menu mocktails are damn expensive ambience not as good as few competitors,3,
the place is within the sln mall in gachiwaliwe took the inside seatingthe ambience is petty collwe had couple of beer  long island ice tea with chi 65 which is yami,5,
"there is a cafe named hyper local cafe in manikonda i do not know if this belongs to the same one but went to this place with certain expectations but was disappointedit has quite a good experienceespecially outside there is a nice setup leaving that apart food was not upto the mark had butter naan and two chicken curries which really did not make me happythey can improvise and can work on the taste

hyper local is the perfect place for a saturday night for a party scene great ambience a dance arena with a good dj and a tv screen for those cricket buffs in d group they have everything for everyone the fries are a must try with the lavish assortment of drinks served here,4,
the experience here was so good the managing staff were really polite to every single person the food was wayyy too good and the ambience was beautiful too had a lovely experience,5,
a great place to have fun good food variety of choices grand menu caring staffwonderful ambience the best part i liked about the place in the use of space for marketing and customer handling everything is just superb staff were very polite and friendly,5,
best place to party in town hyderabad gachibowli sln terminus great service good food nice ambience new place in sln terminus we had a great time with my friends outside area looks amazing thanks you so much guys team hyper local see you soon,5,
i had the worst experience here on april 5th 2019 i came here with my friends they first served cold non veg platter however the worst came in when we ordered momo is the container had three cockroaches running around we returned it immediately the music was pathetic as well we left the place as soon as we could,1,
we liked the chhole bhature as it was not at all oily they serve good italian dishes as well pizza crust is baked well service can be improved,4,
"bartenders are very courteous and well behaved great place to hangout on saturday night
good crowd and beautiful indoor and outdoor seating is available
service is really good
starters are good",5,
"they have this amazing ipl offer
600 for 4 pints  french fries
nice ambience
a bit expensive otherwise
the view is really good spanning the whole city",3,
"oh my god what a horrible place they have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar and in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside they serve cocktails but i would rather drink water than those cocktails 4 of us ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks cocktails including lit a glass of ice and very little juice cost 650 sotb a glass of ice with a little of some another juice old fashion even smaller glass of ice with a slice of orange and pinacolada this i have no idea what they put for the white color apart from that it was bad juice again 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high

all this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom

again that being said when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me we had two zomato gold discounts when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 22 discout the answer strangely was because its the highest priced drink did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer when i implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected

during all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations i guess that too is the part of the cheating plan

be aware people avoid this place",1,
"the drunch trend has picked up in hyderabad and hyperlocal has joined in too
the ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up the utilisation of the limited space is done well a good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set
moving on to the food we tried the newly launched drudge menu priced at rs1200 this was an expensive affair however if you are early ie before 430 pm then you can avail the same drunch for  799
they had a theme which revolved around delhi street food
the drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks we tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler

the buffet consisted of golgappe dahi bhalle sev puri bruschetta mini veg and non veg pizza dahi kachori chole bhature red thai curry with rice chicken tikka fries noodles and chicken tikka pockets

golgappe sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste dahi kachori was a complete let down
the bruschetta stood out and pizza was average
chole bhature were okay but the bhature werent crisp
the red thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a chinese preparation
noodles were randomly kept with no gravy
the chicken tikka pockets were dry
the chicken tikka was good and marinated very well
overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole did not go together the idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just does not sound correct
the music was extremely loud for the place
overall we had a below average experience

based on the drunch menu i would rate it 255",3,
"been here with office colleagues overall a good place to hangout with a gang but the sitting arrangements during day time is very tight as people would want to dine inside rather than out in the hot sun

the food was excellent in taste the chicken dum biriyani had a very different taste and i loved it",4,
the service captain roshan was very friendly and helpful to order non veg plater mutton curry and chicken biryani and drinks very good i am very happy thanks roshan visit again,5,
lovely place with decent ambience the food is really good one of the best service in the city in hyper local roshan was really amazing overall ouder dahi kebab chilly paneer super spicy wings really very good thanks roshan will visit again,5,
want on saturday night has a good outdoor seating the service staffs where helpful quick service hot  fresh food was good fish tikka mutton glooti smoked chicken pizza was excellent overall i have an awesome experience service is very nice thanks roshan will visit again and again,5,
this is a quite happening place with good food and perfect ambience order tawa fish fry and chicken tikka and pasta verry good service all so very good thanks roshan coming agen,5,
simple and elegant ambience polite staff food was really verry good music also good food menu verry less add more food menu service was verry good thanks roshan coming agen and agen,5,
the place is good not the staff untrained few of the staff behave like we owe them some money and they are doing a favour for us  even though music and ambience are good,1,
"we went for a birthday party we ordered the drinks  the alcohol was very less so i called the bearer informed about my issue and guess what he said apke paise se bacardi or coke hi milega  and drink was for 349 what i paid for that drink

although the manager was sweet enough to get me another drink",1,
"simple and elegant ambience 
polite staff 
food was really good 
especially the nonveg platter must try theme 
comfortable seating 
they really make the best and must try cocktails they just enjoy serving their new trials with cocktails  served as complimentary for me when they tried it and the immediate minute it is worth an order of it ",4,
its a decent place for dinner decors and the service is average but the food is good and the bar is fully loaded with great drinks and the offers are also very attractive,3,
"tried two places in same venue on saturday evening in hyper local first seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 630pmordered drinks and snacks spicy chicken wings very hot average taste 35 chilly cheese toastdrab dry 35 drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one i got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka after getting one when asked for plus one  reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small now ok i can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks when told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing

people who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation good bye for ever",1,
i had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place we were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation it separates balcony from the bar we told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing you do not have to worry about anything till that time we had ordered our food but seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out,1,
"we have ordered mutton galouti chholey calzone pesto roast vegetables pizza and penne arrabiata chicken the detailed review are as follows
mutton galouti enriched with spices made up of succulent meat do not try if you do not like spicy food
chholey calzone a treat to the taste buds kulcha pockets filled with chholey
pesto roast vegetables pizza a thin crust pizza with adequate amount of toppings
penne arrabiata  chicken added separately  nice cheesy pasta loaded with vegetables and chicken
nice ambience and satisfactory service",4,

had a great time dining at hyper local the nonveg platter chicken tikka and assorted wingswere very tasty all food our server for the day nitish kumar was very prompt and friendly,5,
one of the worst restaurants in hyderabad very bad service and they did not have most of the things that they specified on their menu card took friend for lunch there thinking to have good time but was one of the worst times,2,
"visited hyper local for their newly launched drunch buffet the buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200 per person the place itself is located in a good open area inside sln terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer

my experience with their food was decent the drunch layout comprised of north indian inspired starters such as dahi bhalle dahi vade gol gappe as well as papdi chaat i would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things my favorite of the lot was their golgappe

speaking about their main course they had a really limited options consisting of chole bhature veg hakka noodles red thai curry chicken pizza steamed rice chicken tikka chicken wings and chicken pockets looking at the price of the drunch i feel a bit more items should have been on offer their chicken pizza and chicken tikka were simply delicious however they need to work upon their thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout

the best part about the place was the drinks section loved the preparation of wet garden cocktail sangria and cranberry cooler special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks one can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place

all in all the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes happy eating ",3,
"hyper local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs despite that it has a reputed name and hype
the place is widely spread evenly with three sections two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area
the first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar the two sections are contrasting with each other the bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink
hyper local has introduced the trending drunch a sundowner party on sundays from 3pm to 7pm
it includes unlimited food and drinks in rs 1200
the food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters main course and dessert
the drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations
coming to food the menu is inspired from the delhi region thus has the typical delhi street style starters like gol gappe papdi chaat matar kulche
chole bhature and dahi vade
the main course has a subtle style including thai red curry noodles rice chicken pockets chicken tikka
dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm
drinks were amazing here my personal favourite was pina colada fall alert and sangria wine from the menu

i tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 22 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well the waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 11 for starters then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we do not speak hindi of course we left immediately and do not think that will ever come back,1,
i went there two times both for lunch first time food was very tasty and service was great but second time there was a little rush which detoriated the quality of food and service both a little bit but overall nice place and a must visit,4,
"situated at the top floor of sln terminus along with food court area
ambience and decor is pleasing
buffet does not do justice to price paid in terms of variety and service we had to wait for bowls spoons and refill of chutney etc
they serve one veg soup 2 veg starter live pasta which was also not upto the mark 3 curry ricebiryani and different bread option gulabjamun and ice cream in dessert",3,
nice and friendly place food was tasty and delicious service was very slow not able to manage for a bigger crowd of 15 people overall a decent place for food,4,
this place is within the sln mall in gachibowli we took the outdoor seating the ambience is fantastic had couple of bears with fries chilli paneer dahi kabab and spring rolls the chilli paneer was very tasty  kabab a bit sweet for my taste buds i feel the good options can be increased overall good experience,4,

"i had death by chocolate from here i can not find words to describe it it was so good

taste 55
amount 55 it will be hard to finish by only one person

just because of a silly reason your customer care executives are talking about rules and ruthlessly saying customer has to bear the costs for uber mistake,5,
"staff is very polite and helpful
services provided is simply amazing
decor is comfortable
the menu contains variety of flavours and each one of them has unique taste to offer
prices are pretty decent

they have different flavours to pic from we had alfanso fruit exotica and ferrero rocher exquisite desserts with unique taste i loved the alphanso they chopped these mangos over the yummy icecream
highly recommended ",4,
we ordered alphonso ice cream we got it with only 23 pieces of mango this is not expected from cream stone as we r regular customer,1,
willy wonka is my favourite it is so delicious and so chocolatey the taste is so good and the choco chips are so crunchy and the brownie is so good totally it is fab,5,
this place is heaven for ice cream lovers used to visit this place everytime after having biryani in paradise  best part abt them is they prepare orders on stone counter only so u see things live happening,5,
"it is summer try to grab this delicious alphonso mango icecreami loved it
i thoroughly enjoyed having this one this is to all the mango lovers out there",4,
quality was bad they just scoop ice cream,1,
i ordered death by chocolate ice cream and as expected the taste was awesome and the best part was the delivery packing it was so nice that ice cream did not melt a bit also overall a good experience,4,
the ice cream is really good the ambiance is cute and the staff is courteous no complaints as such i like my ice cream to be a little subtle sweet but would highly recommend this to all the ice cream lovers,4,
do i have to write something about this ofcourse all of us love it i especially love their alphonso mango  really like their nutella brownie as well,4,
i liked the way they present and the staff were all ladies who prepared the order ice cream was too good that i felt better than naturals at that time i ordered fresh fruits and nuts and it was amazing,4,
"rich taste exotic flavours 

it is my favourite place for desserts and birthday cakes

would definitely recommend everyone to try their ice cream cakes ",5,
"very good concept and unique flavours  my personal favourite is fruit exotica and tiramisu  would certainly again and again just to have these two flavours

eagerly waiting for season special alphonso ice cream ",4,
i have had a number of ice creams here and all the time they are different flavours but nothing can beat their forever amazing brownie break absolutely love it,5,
"when you are craving ice cream and a burst of fresh fruit and nutty flavours cream stone is my go to i always order the green apple ice cream with nuts but when i placed an online order that was not available so i picked the fruit and nut overload and it was heavenly the rich texture if the ice cream combined with the fresh nuts is a delight cream stone can never go wrong
taste 55
service 55",5,
had their nutella brownie ice cream in a cup great tasting it got delivered with proper packaging and dry ice great to the taste just wish they were priced bit lower  will definitely try their other offerings,4,
basically i hail from kolkatamy inlaw gave a treat at this plcjust fell in love with this plceagerly waiting for opening their outlet in kolkata,5,
i have ordered nuts loaded ice cream and also dry fruit ice cream really both ice creams taste was worst they have added more anjeer rather than other dry fruitsreally i did not feel like i am eating ice cream because of anjeer i never going to order ice cream from cream stone people who wants ice cream taste do not go for cream stone dry fruit nuts overloaded and afghan ice creamprice also not reasonable,1,
its a awsm experiencei just love creamstone is ice creamvery fast delivery nd never delayed me orderi wish it will remain sameice creams are so tasty and once someone order frm here am damn sure they never think to go to another icecream shop to eat icecream,5,
my fav past time and this is mine nd my bestie is favourite place to chill out i do order any tine required and their delivery packaging is even quite good best part is it is opened till 1 am,5,
never disappoints me always up to my expectations great choices and i love the extra bits like the oreo is mm is etc to choose as toppings,3,
"good place to order ice cream
hyderabad icecream lovers milksheaks lovers try it from hrere  where the cream stone gachibowli hyderabad",5,
"doesnt entertain ordered placed through food ordering apps had to wait for 45 mins before cancelling the order i even talked to the cashier
after assuring the order will be ready in sometime there was no update",1,
i did not have a good experience here the service was not good the ice cream looked good but i did not like the taste too many nuts the listing in the menu was a bit misleading and did not have anything mentioned about nuts,2,
great taste nice quality affordable prices effective varities plus zomato on time delivery i order here almost daily only problem with this place is caution  you will get addicted for sure,5,
if you are an icecream lover you might have already been here cream stone is one of the best places to get many variety flavoured icecreams at anytime,5,
"i am wondering if i had ordered thick shake or an ice cream thick shake will have better consistency than this most of my previous orders were in the same condition yet i gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand  not any more spending 150 on something like this is utter waste if you guys could not provide ice cream in proper way then please stop giving home delivery despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner i wonder if i can actually call this as an ice cream some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted  not satisfied with your ice cream  not worth spending a single rupee on this one

i was trying to take a pic and then this happened i did not keep pressure while holding you can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture i did not had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out both quantity n quality was not good i understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate i place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes despite of the distance and presence of dry ice the ice cream melted completely",1,
"the quality is good
but found hair in my order which is not good  please be sure the food is good while delivering it 
hope it would be better next time ",3,
i used to crave for the place before i visit and now it seems the waiting was worthy in each bite i can feel the delicacy but we had full stomach when we ordered fruit overloaded and chocolava but i would suggest for one for two people,5,
awesome ice cream shop had waffle nutcracker and lichi lake would recommend to all taste was good and quite budget friendly try out magic pops if you have not tried before,5,
though busy but an awesome place to hang out grab some delicious combinations of chocolate  nutty icecreams shakes waffles and you could probably have the best icecreams to satisfy your cravings,4,
one of my favourite cream stone loved the taste with brownie chocovala i was completely satisfied with the chocovala  i will suggest this to my friends they can also enjoy this same feeling,5,
"masti time helped a lot  refreshing memories office time best choice for the ice cream shops nearby gachibowli  do try death by chocolate ",4,
"as we all know that cream stone is a good place for hangout and it is quite famous for best ice cream

i love this place and i was in my office so we are thinking to order but again we decided to go there and have fun

so me and my friends was started our trip and it was a fun while reaching there

we reach there and have some stone ice cream it was a really good concept of making ice cream on stone and it was a perfect way to make because i have seen many place of making stone ice cream but it was totally different and perfect way 

we enjoyed our night at cream stone and it was really good time with my friend at cream stone",4,
look at the quantity of icecream charging 175 and the product should be worth to it right and the brownie is not at all backed its completed rock chilled,1,
"i am a huge fan of cream stone is death by chocolate ice cream i have never personally been there and i always got it delivered
the packing is always so amazing it is one box of chocolate cake with loaded chocolate sauce and another box that has a mix of vanilla and chocolate ice cream
it is a must try for all the chocolate lovers out there",5,
cool place which will be available till 1pm in hyd beat icreams and very unique especially they have wide range of varieties in chocolate types and service is also quite good except their gm singing in the outlet p,3,
"the best shop worth to buy desserts i brought a caramel sutra its osssssom
from packing delivering to food taste everything is fine
my first order after reaching hyderabad",5,
visited this place a while back their ice creams are totally worth it i would suggest try their listed sundaes rather than make a custom one the prelisted choices are just so much better the only issue is their seating space is a little less so we took our ice creams to go but would recommend it just for the taste,4,
i had dry fruit overload ice cream from this outlet it was the most amazing experience i had on that day if i have to order an ice cream again i will surely choose cream stone again damn it was so amazing i am out of words right now,5,
interior is good but small one and quality of ice cream also good but some of the items like chocolate u can not eat alone bcz of it sweetness,4,
i am not happy the way it is managed no proper response from the workers my order was not yet prepared and these people are not ready to replace my 1 order out of 10 items which i have orders  these people are not working for customer satisfaction they are working for only money not at all happy this time,1,
the more you have the more you crave one of the best icecream concepts ever the way they serve icecream blended in the taste itself is just awesome,5,
i had gone to this place and ordered nutty overload icecream and chocolate icecream with waffles the nutty overload icecream was really good,5,
"ordered nuts overloaded tasted like nothing you could have ever tasted with every bite of the icecream you get loads of nut in your mouth
cream stone has variety of self made ice creams which will make you feel specialye maine kuch bhi likh diya could not think of what to write",5,
cream stone is already aware brand chain as we all know and their quality and making of icecream and shakes are super and every one should try once its costly but the quality also high,4,
i have ordered willy wonka for home delivery it became over frozen by the time i received the same i did a complain and very next day cream stone sent another ice cream for free keep up ur good service,5,
"cream stone is just an amazing place to have some dessert they have almost all the flavors that you can ask for in icecreams they have shakes waffles ice creams sundaes and what not

the ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoples

i tried the red velvet and willy wonka icecreams they are served on a cone which is also very crispy
willy wonka is made from chocolate brownies and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one one ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly

must try if you have a sweet tooth",5,
ordered fruit exotica and fruit and nuts icecream on two different days once from swiggy and once from zomato the icecreams were both melted and lacked the flavour and quality that is usually offered by cream stone highy disappointed i was a fan of cream stone icecreams but i will not recommend this to anyone ever again not worth spending money on,1,
"a must try for all the ice cream lover loved thier way of delivering the ice cream they put ice in the packet  which they deliver ice cream so it can remain frozen awesome concept loved it you could try all menu  but personal favourite is willy wonka do give it a try guys ",5,
ordered fruit exotica and i do not know what the hell is this ice cream but sure it is not what i ordered  not the experience what i wanted but that was indeed a surprise,1,
we ordered fruit exotica it was worth the money had many fruits overloaded into it had many seasonal fruits along with other fruits can try this anytime,4,
"one of my weekend chill out place
my favourite ice creams are
nuts overloaded
arabian nights
dry fruit delight
ferrero rocher
fruit exotica",5,
"one busy place especially in the evenings
cream stone has created a special place for itself since beginning all the ice creams are tasty and the mix ins

wide range of ice creams  cream blends home made waffle bowls and cones makes it unique

my personal fav are alphonso mango icecream death by chocolate and brownie break

one good stop for ice cream lovers",4,
taste was pathetici did not like it roadside ice cream would be better than this,1,
very good on time delivery,5,
"it was great butthe standards have lowered my choco lava was like stone and ice cream was like cream anusha has done the worst job
i now do not prefer this placethere are much better places where people at least listen when you say how your ice cream is looking",1,
best place for ice cream in the area the ambience is also nice the nutty concepts range of ice cream is a must try the rates are higher but the quality is good,5,
best ever ice cream i have ever had for the last few years and i have a lot of people who feel like me ijust love you so much for the great ice cream you have made for me,5,
i loved the taste of qvality of ice cream and i love the response of the restaurant and its delecious mostily i love the afghan nuts ice cream,5,
wonderful place for ice creams my favorite would recommend this place to my friends and family great ambience great taste and consistency of the ice creams is very good,5,
quantity was less,1,
ice cream got melted even before reaching memy place is 5 min from creamstone,4,
"nice place staffs are friendly and create great icecream experience

location is perfect just in the heart of gachibowli one of the favourite hangout places for people",5,
ordered nuts overloaded ice creamfantastic taste,5,
delivery was before time 5 star for delivery person,5,
cream stone is the best hangout place when it comes to latenight drives  only issue is the place can become a bit crowded and order takes a bit extra time to come,5,
its a creamstone what can i say goodnicecream is my weakness but this branch has just become super busy can you see how many zomato guys have lined up for the order,3,
well i love love love all the icecreams here having said that i have my favourites three to be precise death by chocolate chocolate overdose and karamel sutra when i am on a diet i get their diet fruit concept icecream i am that mad about their icecreams this is one of those places where i gawk on my food and forget to click pictures,5,
it is too crowded with delivery executives all the time do not find place to sit mostly it would be better if they provide some way out preferable to online order than physical visit,3.5,
cream stone is always best but even when the cake that we require is completed they are still showing the cake on online deliveryit can be changed so that customers do not face any trouble,5,
whenever i have a craving for ice creams cream stone is the solution i am a coffee lover so the first thing that i tried here is coffee craze the taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts the next thing that i tried here is the chocolate overdose it is a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie the icecreams are extremely rich and intense overall i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours,5,
"i could not finish ice cream at all not at all good
never like the place as specially sitafal taste is very very bad very crowdy place but taste is not at all good",1,
goo blend of ice cream good flavours as well they have many varieties in fruit and chocolate flavors try ice cram but big no for waffles they are very hard,4,
poor service have ordered ice cream and it took 1 hour to reach meby the time when it reached it is not like ice cream it is like milk shake completely melted they did not add solid ice inside the package at all too pathetic online delivery service by creamstone gachibowli branch never expected this from them because am a big fan of creamstoneit disappointed me badly by it is poor service,1,
"cream stone is always a best place if you are found of variety of icecreams  been here for many occasions and when we thought of visiting a place in the late night 

taste is very good and prices are moderate and variety of the items are so good 

i would definatly recommend all to visit here",5,
ordered nutella brownie and got brownie and vanilla ice cream it is a shame that they write the name of the ice cream correct take the money correct but fail to make the ice cream correct not expected from cream stone your customers are not fools dont insult them by assuming that they are less intelligent,2,
i love treating myself to cream stone every once in a while it is the perfect treat i have tried almost all their flavors and i love every single one my favorite would be willy wonka i love chocolate i am not fond of their waffles though but the ice creams are to die for  definitely visit cream stone,5,
good timing,5,
"i have heard a lot about this ice cream parlour from my friends of hyderabad and chennai i did not miss to visit this place when i was in hyderabad i ordered one ferrero rocher it was like heaven 
the place is very small for indoor seating i think  the management should increase their indoor seating arrangement due to their large crowd

if u r a icecreamlover  this place will be the perfect bliss for you",5,
"a perfect dessert for you and a must have surprise gift for your partner  try the chocolate over dose and enjoy the pure bliss of chocolate in your mouth  can reduce the sugar content a bit ",5,
it is a ever busy place that reeks of laughter  sugar in the air the cream stone brand is ever known  but what sets apart gachibowli from others is it is courteous staff  ambient seating area its a go to place for isb iiit  hcu students,3,
"totally recommended for crazy ice snowppl
ambience 25
taste 55
pocket friendly 35
this place is not at all for dine in because of crowd
there is flavour for every one",4,
super delevery,5,
delivery behaviour good,5,
"i have ordered several times from cream stone
one of the finest place for ice creams quality and taste of ice creams are top notch you will fall in love with this ice creams",5,
please look at the below image this is how i got my order when i order from zomato i had a confusion to eat it or gulp it however i gave 2  for the browny,2,
not ggod,1,
they did not packed the ice cream nicely ie did not keep any dry ice because of that it got melted and spreads in the pckage a bit disappointed other than that taste is good,3,
ice cream was melted before it reached me and i did not see dry ice pieces in it either service was too bad,1,
ice cream was good  but it is totally got melt as delivery boy took a lot of time to reach he mentioned it as delivered as soon as he picked order he took nearly 45 minutes to come,1,
"1half of ice cream spilled inside the package only
2i ordered caremel sutrabut i got brownie ice cream
3and i cream is in liquid state like a milkshakei did not expect this from cream stone at alli have pic of them with me",1,
the food is economically reasonable the north indian dishes including chole kulche chole bhature and paneer butter masala are comparatively better than the chaats,3,
oh ho this place serves amazing parathas and their combos are worth it you experience it to appreciate it lot of crowd at meal times so u might have to wait 1520 min for your parantha to be made but worth the waitthey have a small seating area inside too,5,
today i was very hungry as i had to skip my breakfast due to the workload moreover i did not want to spend more than a hundred bucks on the brunch this was the only restaurant on my mind you can order a paratha soaked in butter with raita chutney and onions it is heavenly all for less than 100,4,
ordered vada pav and pav bhaji they had a variety of chats  both the dishes were too delicious a good snacks joint in hyderabad their dahi papri should top your list,5,
"order rajma in 200 rupees taste is not that good and quantity is too less as per charges

too too much spicy was not able to eat it without water

if you cant cook properly better dont sell it",1,
their gol gappa is a must try it is different from what we get in hyderabad chole bhature was also good ignore the attitude of the staff especially the one at the counter,3,
aloo onion paratha was awesome delicacy to have  sardarji tussi great ho  mouth watering would love of you provide some more at cheaper price lassi is awesome as well thank you paji,5,
been there for couple of times hoping that they will improve in terms of quality and service but honestly if you really want to eat some dumplings mix with 2or 3 pices of potatoes or paneer or whatever then go there and i bet you you will curse yourself later the funniest thing is that they do not even know how to make a proper paratha or kulcha they are just making fool to everyone on the name of north indian food instead search for another joints in madhapur or gachibowli like parathas and more or just paratha there you will get the real authentic food,1,
dropped down my expectations ordered aloo tikki which was worst and palak chat which ended up delivering dhahi chat that tasted sweet i regret ordering,1,
i ordered dahi bhalla papdi chaat and this is how they packed they should pack it in a plastic box the dahi was spilled over the polythene and hardly 20 of the dahi was left in the container i paid money for nothing they should give my money back for it,4,
i have been visitingordering from this place for over 2 years now chaats here used to be amazing but the quality these days has gone down,3,
i love the gol gappe here at hyderabad the gol gappe are different they add dal in it where as i am used to masala aloo filling and they provide it best in gachibowli,4,
if you are craving for a chaat you must visit this place i tried karara palak chaat dahi poori and paani poori its not as good as we have it in north but definitely a must try,4,
"i ordered aloo methi paratha and i am it was awesome just feel lik i am eating ghar ka khana its yummy
previously also i have ordered from this restaurant and the food is so good i think people should go there and have food its really good",5,
the food is delicious from this place very meticulous packaging i have tried pav bhaji chole bhature and almost all the snacks the place has to offer reasonable prices and good food quality i would definitely recommend this place to try for various chaats and snacks,5,
"i had food from this place many times i was glad when i found north indian chat in hyderabad its not that good as we can have in north but still a good chat place as compared to others whatever i know
quanity55
quality 45
packaging  55
delivery 55",4,
"lods of lods of lods of food

are you veg lover then it will be like paradise for you they server many varities of kulcha paratha vada pav sand wich   chats loved aloo kulcha and dal makhani like hell paratha and vada pav are yummy we have mixed veg paratha and the taste was good with many veggies in it vada pav was considerable nothing can beat mumbai is vada pav had lemon juice but did not like that we have opted for this as there is no lassi point in time over all good food with good price",4,
good delivery,5,
have been eating in sardarji is from a long time but now i feel they have lost the taste in their food nothing is good not even chat will have to look out for another option in hyderabad for good chat,2,
amazing chaat and street food just like back in north the taste and hygiene is awesome which is why this place is in my list when it comes to street food their chats are delicious i would ordered pav bhaji sev puri and vada pav all was yummy will recommend this place to anyone who is fond of north indian food,4,
"sardaarji is chaats  more serves really good punjabi food if you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food this place is a really good option in and around gachibowli as the name suggests they have amazing chaats

i have tried parathas from a lot of places in gachibowli and found the perfect places for parathas but this place not only has tasty parathas but the price is also very reasonable the only problem is the packaging it is not horrible you can work with it but comapared to a lot of other places it is not that great

aloo paratha combo had two big parathas pickel raita and onions it was delivered hot and fresh papadi with dahi was delicious the curd was smooth and creamy not at all sour and had a tangy sauce added in it the papadis were very crispy and crunchy it was topped with green chutney
the quantity of the chaat is not a lot so if you are really hungry maybe order two of these or order something else with it
i will definitely try their other chaat options soon

since i never visited this place can not talk much about the hygiene of this place but overall the experience was good",4,
in plain simple words overhyped very greasy and oily and bland taste order chole bhatire mix veg kulcha daal makhani and aloo tikki everything was very poor in taste better to put some effort and visit bikanerwala in jubilee hills,1,
not the place if you belong to northern india no doubt the hygiene is well maintained but food is not as delicious as i expected it to be service is quick though also they dishes are quite overpriced,3,
world class tasty,5,
maybe all these 4 and 5 star reviews are paid ones ordered aloo paratha first of all quality of the food is bad bad odour from raita and then instead of sending pickle they sent something where i can only see mirchis but no pickle,1,
"the chaat that this restaurant offers is amazing and never ate such delicious sevpuri ever in hyderabad amazing taste satisfying quantity chaat lovers must try ",5,
"went two three times after that decided to give the rating 5 
what ever the item i consumed are very tasty like paneerbutter masala aloo paratha paneer kulhca samosa ragada chole batura not enough place packed with people still delivering the orders in time is good overall you can visit this place",5,
"its simply awesome  one of the best places in gachibowli to have proper delicious authentic north indian chat items the real chat palace i do not think anyone would get disappointed with the food here 

nice place to go in the evenings and have something tasty like kachori pav baji  dahipuri  vada pav etc etc  i would highly recommend everyone to taste food here ",4,
"it was too good we ordered bhelpuri dahi papri and aloo tikki with chutney i must admit three of them were equally good the dahi papri was sweet n tangy bhelpuri was well balanced with spices and lot of shev and finally aloo tikki with dhaniya chutyney was tangy and spicy in a balanced way with well balanced spices and awesome taste this place stole my heart

atoneplaceonlinecom",5,
"we tried aloo tikki with dahi although it was not bad but it was not like authentic delhi side aloo tikki
i will definitely try other dishes here",4,
"yesterday i ordered chole bhature and tawa butter pav bhaji chole were lip smacking it is a must try for all pav bhaji was a bit of disappointment the quantity of bhaji was less and taste was just average that is why i deducted 1 star but chole  definitely deserves the rest 4 stars ",4,
food had no flavour  does not have any flavour of authentic punjabi food food is too plainwould not recommend this even as last resort  try to,1,
the food is great but they can improve on the ambience especially liked the golgappe and chaat though ordering food online was not a great experience once i recieved incomplete order while other time packaging of chaat was not great,4,
i had tried the paneer kulcha combo and aloo tikki it was delicious and their chole is the best price is very reasonable and delivery is also good,4,
"ordered paav bhaji chole bhature and papdi chat
but they forgot to deliver the chati was a bit disappointed by thatbut the taste was good",3,
i ordered paneer butter masala paneer quality is best but gravy is not tasty,3,
missing cutlery,4,
"i ordered paneer butter masala with one butter naan and lachha paratha and my alltime favorite punjabi chole bhature

chole bhature was yummy paneer butter masala was not that great in comparison of chole bhature",4,
"this restaurant is famous for quick bites and street food it is located in indra nagar gachibowli which is the most accessible place for techies in hyderabad this place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintained

we get all kinds of street food like chaat pav bhaji paratha chole bhature rajma chawal etc we had chole bhature and this was the best that i had in the recent times if you want you can get extra chole curry and the butter milk and lassi here has the punjabi essence in it you will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with butter milklassi

if you are in search of proper north indian snacks or street food do visit and try food from this restaurant the cost in this restaurant is very affordable for the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable",4,
"delivery by zomato by quick they have removed sandwiches from their menu some of the food items are priced high overall good experience
chole bhatoore 55

chole bhatoore were amazing do eat those bhatoore at the outlet itself",5,
"sardarji is gives you a feel of north indian chat and chole bhatoore outlets they have that similar arrangement outside where everyone have to stand and enjoy their chatpav bhajichole bhatoore on high tables

i recently visited sardarji is and tried lot of items of it

gol gappe 355
gol gappes were good but the paani can be made more tangythey only have one varieties of paaniand of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in it

aloo tikki 45
aloo tikki was very good red and green chutneys were perfect

samosa 45

chole bhatoore 55
chole bhatoore were amazingdo eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at homecholes are also very tasty

looking forward to try more of their itemstheir naan size was huge and other items looked very tempting

must visit place if you want to enjoy some tasty chatchole bhatoore and that too at a very affordable price",4,
taste not good as expected ordered a dahi papdi chaat but not worthy taste not good as expected ordered a dahi papdi chaat but not worthy,1,
"chat section is awfulvery bad

ordered aloo tikki chatdahi tikki chatand papdi chatgot messy papdi and spoild food

taste was very badshitty

it was like cheatinga customer who paid u",1,
food here is decent for the price paid paneer paratha was awesome and huge could easily fulfill even when one is very hungry tried others like paneer butter masala did not like it that much,4,
no cutlery no seal on the box poor packing,2,
"a very good chaat and snacks stop reminds me of north indian street chaats taste and am a regular customer here now especially of papadi chaat worth a try and you will love it ",4,
i have been here many times i like the food but never order food online you will get very cold food inspite of instructions to name a few samosa is veg biryani etc you will definitely regret,2,
"sardarji is chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi

the sandwiches especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome the dahi bhalla dahi papdi is are good too 
however off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food

another complaint i had with them are their parathas they are bad polar opposite to their chaat dishes i would never recommend anyone ordering paratha is from this place and i tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked this is the reason i have rated them as 3 out 5",3,
better to take away or ask for delivery cost is fine but the taste is the specialty north indians can find their taste and dishes being rediscovered here,5,
the perfect north food with perfect punjabi taste from the chaat to bhature all the items are good if you are looking for northpunjabi dish order you will love it,5,
testless foodnan are almost burntdo not like the food at allthe paneer butter masala tests like sumberthey have send tadka in place of dal makhnitotally wastage of money,1,
awesome food  i tried chat and samosa and it is one of the best in hyderabad must try and zomato provide the facility to order online which adds to your likings,5,
i received wrong orderi tried to contact with restaurant but they did not received the callthis is the worst experience ever i ordered online,1,
excellent taste,5,
"i went to the himagiri hospital and when i came out of there i really felt hungry and so my sister suggested that we should go to this place as this place serves excellent punjabi food i ordered chole bature and lassi trust me the type of lassi which i had over there i had exactly that kind only in punjab and nowhere else the chole bature too was delicious
but i did not like the ambiance just try to work on that otherwise everything is upto the mark

ambiance255
food55
service355",3,
if you are from north and you miss its chat then this place is a must visit for all chat lovers they have tastiest samosa chat and bhel puri and their pani puri is so so amazing,4,
"we ordered samsa chola kulcha chola and sandwichs the taste quality is too much low i did not eat this type of quality food from different restaurantworst taste and worst quality i ever had ",1,
this the the beat place to have real punjabi food the taste and aroma of delicious food is juat mouth watering you will not regret any single time to eat here,5,
nice taste of north indian chaat rahi bhalle and chole bhature chole bhature is one of the favourite for us most of the time ordered from here specially for that,5,
roti nd nan both u gave me without butter nd i ordered with butternd both are burnt even paneer curry quantity was too less manno1 can eat a single chapathi with thatnd panner pieces were in burnt condition,1,
"they will accept your order even if they do not have the items after 40 mins they say they do not have it and doesnt cancel it and delivery boy will also mark your order as delivered in short words  go for dine in or choose different good apps to order ",1,
too bad service does not accept the order multiple times  does not receive calls too and the best part they cancel the orders after money gets deducted very bad experience i mean worst experience,1,
really good with the taste and the quality pocket friendly and worth giving a try dal makhani with rice is what i would recommend to try,4,
"i have been to this place after six months i have tried chaat and aloo naan with daal makhni but all tasted average
there is some serious issue with the person sitting at cash counter he was very unprofessional with customers",2,
packing is not good,3,
no spoon  no tissues,1,
"located in indira nagar this outlet serves chats along with limited tandoor and punjabi style main course dishes ordered paneer butter masala half along with rumali roti and butter naan prices were reasonable and pocket friendly less than 200 bucks ai

paneer butter masala was extra tangy unlike traditional restaurant style dishes paneer quantity was very less 4 small pieces served in a cup of smooth textured gravy tandoori items tasted good ordered earthen pot cooled milk in the end with chat masala added 30 bucks per glass",3,
tasteless dal makhani eating kulcha with it made it tasteless too,1,
"hyderabad and good north indian food was wondering where will i find such good north indian food until i landed to this place

taste  ordered chats and dal makhani  alu kulcha combo must say such tasty punjabi food made me very happy
service  good service

the counter is busy on weekends totally if you crave for punjabi food this is a must visit place",4,
the best vada pav i had in gachibowli chaats are just awesome you will love alu kulcha with dal makhani although they should increase the quantity of dal makhani but overall it is a great place to eat,5,
"ordered via zomato delivery great taste and packaging however portions can be increased a little though also dude no onion or green chutney along ",4,
it was the second time i ordered something from here and both the times food was delicious  first time i ordered for an alloo paratha it was huge in size and was not able to eat full  and this time ordered aloo cheese sandwich  it was yummy  loved it  will definitely try some other things from here,5,
this is something one would definitely like they serve n number of variety in north indian food must try once they will never disappoint you l bet,4,
one of the better places to go for north indian style paranthas chat is also good not that great though if you want north indian style have been here quite a number of times and always find it crowded has never disappointed,4,
"had samosa pani puri  kulcha combo here
best food 
hygiene wise a bit low food was far better to ignore all other lows
highly recommend",4,
yesterday there was leakage of water pipepossibly drainage pipeat restaurant  instead of repairing that they are shamelessly kept counter open  customer had to stand in line while water is leaking beside and at the same time eat beside that water leaking pipeline  i would suggest first repair pipe line and then open restaurant serving in this condition to customers shows no value of customers,1,
ordered bhel puri from this place and i found an ant in while i was eating these guys are unhygienic and dont take necessary precautions to ensure that they protect the food they prepare from all the insects around the area be careful,1,
"if you dont want to deliver the food then dont accept the orders in the first place and the cancellation call from zomato comes when you expect your food be careful while accepting the orders or at least dont make  the hungry people wait even to know about the cancellations 

giving 1 star bcoz cant rate below that",1,
"punjabi food gets youwell go there soon then their chole bhature and club grilled sandwiches are something which are really amazing even the best joints can not beat

there is no ambiance or proper sitting but it is worth it",4,
"worst daal makhani i have ever tasted in my life kinda weird taste it was
minus rating is not there otherwise i would definitely have punched that",1,
the delivery guy did not return the change he said he ll be getting change in 5 mins and he disappeared,1,
this was very first time in south that i heard alot about northern delicacy chole bhature but i would say i am disappointed with the taste as it is nowhere near to what it should be and prices are also very high,3,
delivery on time,5,
if there was an option of putting up 0 stars i wouldnt have hesitated look at the kind of food they offer i had ordered this aloo kulcha combo from this restaurant a burnt kulcha and not even a bowlful of dal was served the combo mentioned pickle as well but that was not sent either despite complaining them with requisite proofs no action was taken terrible,1,
i order a veg biryani it was cold when it reached me the taste was just bland and they had 14th of the biryani filled with half cooked beans even the cauliflower was not cooked properly they should just remove the biryani from their menu forever,1,
had the worst experience ever having ordered paneer butter masala and getting mix veg paranthas was not at all expected so guys be prepared if you get a totally different dish than what you order online,1,
again left the salad in the order,3,
"ordered samosa aloo tikki with chutney papdi dahi bhalla sev batata puri
samosa with chutney was good liked it
papdi dahi bhalla was good
did not like the taste of sev batata puri
did not like aloo tikki it was not freshly made  felt like the potato was spoilt
chole bhatoore was good and pav bhaji was ok
did not like the taste of bhel puri",3,
ordered sev batata puri mumbai vada pav mumbai samosa pav samosa cheese grilled sandwich and veg club grilled sandwichtaste was goodnot spicy as preferredonly disappointed with the packaging,4,
"wahh ji waah dilli ki yaad dila diya apne toh

after staying in delhi for 3 years i was looking for a chatwala in hyderabad here i found the chatwala now the taste can be improved but something is better than nothing",4,
if you crave for some mumbai style chaat then this modest place is for you absoultely pocket and taste bud friendly i would definitely recommend this for a casual snack time yet to try the main course here,4,
very impressive delivery amazing work,5,
chole was too oily,3,
great place to have good chat very well made dahi papdi and aalu tikki especially because their dahi tastes very fresh and feels like home made only order one full paratha for yourself if you are extremely hungry though the filling is great but it is very heavy,4,
heard a lot about this small food joint and the north indian stuff they make should say i am disappointed looks like the quality is not the same as before even the price is a bit high compared to other places with similar taste,2,
got the chole bhature for  66 only through fav50 was craving for some good old punjabi flavour and this was perfect,5,
have only one packet of curry instead of 2,3,
great good,5,
they have reduced the quantity a lot,2,

ramadanspecial
reviewmode

bbbq nation has come up with all new dawat e  ramadan where they have bought in few of the best street foods of ramadan which really makes one visit and satisfying their foodie soul is

i was pretty excited to try out their ramadan special menu and the moment i enter i see a big raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot mutton chops searing on ghee that view enticed me and i just walked toward it to see that beauty happening i could not wait to try that super appetising chops and delicious raan

besides they also got chicken shawarma and mutton haleem which is another different delicacy storyline
i had to take a big bowl of haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and final touch with two spoons of ghee yes that is my style 

i walked to see few more exciting dishes and i found the legendary badami gosht yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides murgh mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers

cannot miss thier gosht biryani  one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well perfectly tender meat and soft and fragrant basmati with a touch of ghee

only because of the taste and being foodie i had two rounds of everything and was full
but there is always a another stomach for kulfi
panpistamalai voila",5,
this is one of my favourite restaurant with grill concept ambience was really fascinating food quality was too good  my favourite recipe is grill pineapple it is delicious,4,
"have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013 have been to the restaurant in different cities and have noticed some significant differences across all locations
this gachibowli bbq nation has some items missing from its live counter but have curd rice which was not available in any other location i have been to
the staff is extremely courteous we were served by rajib who was really warm quick in his service
the overall quality of the food was satisfying just like most of the other outlets i have been to",4,
"as usual it is fab place to have grill in a buffet non veg is awesome here chicken mutton prawns fish are served on the grill some days you also get crab curry now they opened tawa starters as well

nice place to go for team lunchdinner",5,
"food quality is good but not so many items like crabs octopus kofta are available  particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of bn or abs so it was really disappointing

also service was a bit slow we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between that really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good i think the number of waiters are less

ac facility was good very cold

but i do not recommend this place",2,
this is an amazing place for veg as well as non veg starters there are so many varieties in it as you will be already full you do not generally go for main course and also it is very average i really love their service suppose you do not like item they will replace it by customising according to your requirement,5,
service was excellent biriyani and service excellent very nice food very good staff and servise drinks was excellentbbq chiken very test and fish pine apple very test service and food quality is excellent,5,
was wife is birthday and our anniversary as well naresh and bipul made it point to make it extra special the hospitality and the culture of the employees keeps taking me back there forever,5,
this place always exceeds expectations friendly staff customised orders and finger licking good food and of course you need a second stomach for the desserts,5,
"it is barbi bossno comments
it is was sudden plan from gang to visit this place fortunately that day was 10 years celebrations day of bn
we got some discount on bill also we all from coastal area basically and sea food lovers
believe me or not i loved and felt happy wit prawns hereyummy and yummy
it might sillywe did justice to my money may more also
that was a weekday and i want to try this place on some weekend",5,
had to wait a bit to get a table that is a good thing  great food and best service such a great staff sudeep roy naresh ur a star i have seen him doing everything keep up the good work guys,5,
"i am a big fan of bbq nation since a decade now this however was my most dissatisfying experience to date after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past

the only thing they handled well from the word go was the seating i booked a table for 14 from zomato it was ready for us when we arrived

everything else seemed to be falling apart their team was struggling to deliver

the starters took forever to be served most of them tasted similar though were called different things refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things the mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this some were duly replaced

the chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes when we held our ground he went back to personally create some dishes his version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then

i would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table

hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together",3,
"had a worst experience today at barbq nation  gachhibowli hyderabad

taste is not as good as remaining branches non veg items seem to be frozen few days back then coocked feels like a was while eating",1,
this is the worst barbeque  i have ever seen in my life barbeque for name sake no barbeque item like paneer fish was baked properly waste of money,1,
we went to this place as a part of corporate outing it was my first time to barbeque nation i must admit that i was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction the starters alone were enough to fill up my belly when it came to having the main course the options were not many but it suffficed i would say the waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies,4,
"barbeque is mostly my favorite but if i compare barbeque nation with abs  sahib is barbeque obviously i have to give one point less to this onefood is good but limited itemsbut if you have kid go there my son and my friend is kids enjoyed a lot there they were given car and balloon by staff and lots of fruits and french friesthey enjoyed to the core ambience is gud service excellent

food 35
ambience 45

this place was really amazing as usual the staff is very polite appreciate their work in maintaining professionalism loved being serviced by saif ali khan and staff,5,
been to the place recently the service was on a slower side strangely but the food items on the grills taking a little longer to arrived food good as usual,4,
"friday afternoon we planned team lunch veg  nonveg in gachibowli barbecue nation we were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food  variety served was average and was not upto standard wrt taste  variety

in short it was not value for money 

i think it would be better to choose absolute barbecue over barbecue nation as customer you get value for money seems like now barbecue nation is just riding on its legacy",3,
inside atmosphere is goodand serving and way of treating everything i loved itand very reasonable price for partieswe can enjoy with friends,5,

located in the heart of financial district it is very convenient place to visit on a weekday with colleagues their service was simply superb they tried to understand the requirement of the customer is on each and every table and customized the spice level etc based on the request had good number of options in veg as well over all food was very good service was exceptional,4,
kirak bole tho kirak hyderabadi language just loved it had a nice time enjoyed the food mainly pan kulfi loved iiiittttttttttttttttttttttttttt,5,
"the staffs at bbq gachibowli are very good from start to end they took care which dish is goodany modifications needed
food was very tastystartermain course
you can try fish fingerchefs special made on request",5,
"friendly service
the restaurant ambience is good
the food tastes good
and they need to increase the desserts
and jst increase the items
awesome finally",5,
been many times here and the place is not crouded during dinner time the best time to visit this place is during dinner time only as lunch time too much crouded with office guys specially mon to fri coming to food  prawns and fish starters are too too good  other kebabs also too good staff is too good in service and they treat us like kings and queens i strongly recommend gachibowli branch as less crowded during dinner and weekens,5,
the taste of increase when its bbqits taste doubled when is comes to barbeque nation service is more jet spedfood was excellentneed little improvement in ambiance,5,
waiters butter customers more than the kebabs  jokes apart the service is too good and they do have a decent range of items eventhough they lack in terms of number of items but it is compensated with the quality level the place feels a bit cramped up bt got a good vibe to it definitely would visit again,4,
awesome place awesome food lovely staff azaad hussain was tremendous at his work one of the most polite guy i ever see in any restaurant,5,
this place is good when you come empty stomach just kidding  barbeque nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts has a lag in my order when i had been there last time but i guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine a very good place with very welcoming staff,4,
went yesterday to bbq wonderful service special thanks to roy who took care of ushe kept checking if everything was fine or need to customize anything food was yummy became a big fan of bbq good going guys,5,
"early christmas celebrations we were dressed up and wanted fine dine we were told that barbeque nation is always booked we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 930
from the greeting to serving and the host was so nicei must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service
the starters were amazingi love prawns but it is kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned 
but their prawns are the best grilled prawns i ever tasted they could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine  the starters were so yumm that we did not want to try the main course my personal favs were grilled prawns and rosemary chickenmmm  mmm mmmmm yummy  

thank you so much for your excellent service and great foodhope to visit you guys soon",4,
who does not like bbq and having it from bbq nations is a good experience chicken tikka nadi fish are really tasty as part of new year celebration there were some new dishes which was passable expected better in desserts,3,
"we have been having a grand time whenever we visit barbeque nation gachiwoli be it the food the ambience and the hospitality of the staffs this place is a must visit the staffs here treat you as a part of family and serve you till you get the utmost satisfaction on the taste and quantity of the food
i would specially like to mention about mr naresh from bbq nation gachiwoli the way he treats and welcomes you will make you visit this place all over again and again he takes care of you from giving you the best seats available to the best of the food you can have i give him and this place 5 bright stars",5,
"food 45
ambiance  good enough
service  the staff were all very polite but a bit slow

the taste of food was very good they had chicken tandoori mutton kebab veg kebab american corn creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff on the grill they served one variety each of chicken basa fish prawn mushroom paneer pineapple the main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it the dessert options were sorted and tasty they had 2 ice cream flavours gulab jamun kheer brownie milk cakes pastries and tarts 2 kulfi over all the experience was very good

would want to visit again",4,
it used to be one of my favourite places and the destination for all family celebrations however over the time i feel it has lost that touch there is no more aawww feeling when u eat at this place they do not compromise on the quality of food but i was disappointed with the taste we tried at both forum mall and gachibowli branches and it felt the same,3,
been here with friends on a weekday for dinner and this place never fails to meet expectationsbe it any outlet the food is greatthe staff was friendly only one negative with this outlet is spaceit is extremely congestedthe tables are too closely placedhardly any proper aisle space for guests to walk,4,
great staff always ready to serve with smile celebrated our anniversary over there got exceptional service by ravi kumud and chef always take care of our spice level love to visit again and again,5,
very much satisfied with the food and service they had customised kulfi with different types of toppings and it is really good the nonveg starters are served with normal spice levels and are tasty if you like spicy food ask for tandoori chicken with extra spices you will love it,5,
had been there twice everytime had a wonderfyl experience good ambience and very friendly staffs the chef himself turn to us asking for any special items to be ordered great service,5,
"food
i had the non veg buffeti loved the starters and the dessertsi personally like their kulfies the most

everything else
i have been to this branch twice service is really goodi had a great experience its the best barbeque restaurant i have been to

will i go again definitely",5,
we were here to give our treat to a group of friends what started out with cold barbeque bad grills turned out to worst the grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant as soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters werent coming quickly we dint know what we were calling for the waiters visited our table every 23 mins to enquire if everything is alright now i am not exaggerating when i say that they came to me at least 2025 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good i did not dare to say that they werent still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming they almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal finally i was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till i did that feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture the food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good barbeque nation please do not pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it is extremely irritating being answerable every minute btw this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad,1,
"the best restaurant we have been to till date
awesome food and great service the hospitality shown at the restaurant each and every time that we have visited is at the peaks compared to other restaurants we treat this restaurant as a family restaurant and make sure we visit this once a month never disappointed us in any aspect
not even once",5,
we went to barbeque nations for thanks giving special day team lunchitems are good but service is very slow we waited for long time for food items after ordereddeserts and starters are nice,3,
good place for team lunch but has pathetic veg starters optionpotato and mashroom but they tell will smile that this is all for today i am writing this review whole i am in the restraint itselfimprove barbequeevery customer is important,1,
for ravi  he is friendly politely answering to questions good in taste yeah it is very good everything is fine and the kulfi you do not believe me,5,
extremely courteous staff  great servicespecial mention to kumud barman for his exemplary servicekeep up the good work guys good job,5,
nice place very good food but main course should be be improved because starters 4 dessert 4 and main course 35 because food in main course was not upto mark need some taste build up,4,
"5 star standard  specially mentioning rm mr bivison and staff mr gopal we were welcomed served and treated with high standard quality also the chef basudev make sure that our prefrance is fulfilled
thank you bivison and for taking care",5,
"excellent place
taste of food is good spread is good value for money
service is excellent
if you wish to go for a barbeque this is the best place in hyd",4,
"have visited this place on 2nd october with my family to celebrate my sister is birthday all the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch place is not that huge but very well maintained hospitality is top notch by their staff

coming to food starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table chicken prawns mushroom paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely it was really amazing in taste potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow there was no dish which didnt disappoint

main course  this is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations all the dishes were really good in taste usually i skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here i have tried and it was really good egg curry chicken mutton rogan all were good biryani was also good noodles with sauce were delicious enough it was not their just to keep up the numbers

dessert  my favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth pastries please cake kheer brownie all were good kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top

overall we had a ball at this place from starter to main course and dessert all were really good they did not give us any point where anything can be deducted service was top notch as usual and value for money this outlet is one the best on in hyderabad hands down",5,
we are very satisfied with the food and the service was excellent we want our customers to be fully satisfied said the chef and he meant it,4.5,
we went to this place on wednesday for dinner it was difficult to find a table and had to wait for 30 minutes the ambience of the place is average and its a small place however the starters were really good crispy corn panner tikka mushroom and fruit bbq coming to the main course it was average but the desserts were really good especially gulab jamun rabadi and kulfi,4,
really these barbeque nation is outlet is so friendlyi never seen beforewe went there last night total number were 40lots of kids were in my gangthey are playing a lotthey are means staffs of barbeque nation always looking smilenow foods are just too goodkuch kehene ki baat i nehi hain,5,
to start with  the complimentary drinks blue mojito  pacific blue  fresh lime soda were refreshing the nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken  prawns or fish head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day the veg starters  mushroom is a immediate no  cripsy corn was not salted properly  paneer came as a saviour maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer coming to desserts  its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled browine was too dry  cakes were not tasty applepineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup  phirni an absolute no  kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section i can only rate it 3 for food  5 for service  3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter,3,
we had a fantastic time and loved the service and food both the serving personnel made extra sure of comfort for the kids kudos to azaad and team,5,
"i almost forgot to write the review as i got too busy until i found these pictures in my gallery i was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month what a bad day it was when you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food first of all the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen i was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances i politely asked to replace the drink that was served but things got too much for me when i found a hair in the crispy corn when i put this into light to the serving staff they just tried to take away the plate and all i got to listen was they will replace it that is what drove me mad when i demanded to see the manager he apologized and asked for the plate replacement but i was done with the food now no more nonsense at the end the manager showed up with a specially made chocovanilla dessertin pic
not just the hygiene but the service was bad too the team was all the time waiting for them to get the food the overall experience was bad something not expected from a bbq nation",2,
this place goes and keeps up with the name amazing starters the chicken kebabs are wonderful the crispy corn and the cajun spice potatoes are super duper awesome after the rounds of starters there was not any space for the main course so directly went for desserts their in house kulfis are the speciality here paan kulfi tastes the best gulab jamuns with icecream make the perfect combo,4,
"awesome food and awesome servicespecially by mr gopal who was awesome with his services 
keep it up and thumbs up for barbeque nation  gachibowli
my birthday went awesome",5,
"food quality has degraded than before
ice tea served was more proportion of water  ice tea flavour was not there at all partha served over the counter was pathetic it was having very bad quality of oil not even ghee very much upset with the food quality this time",2,
"awesome place 

1 good ambiance
2 great food  veg
3 chef always comes to your table to know if we are enjoying the starters and any improvement is needed or any special starter that we prefer etc


my kid loves this place and we have been there multiple times and still do not get bored",4,
and of course the best place to celebrate your special occasions beautiful place to dine with your friends and family perfect ambiance delicious food a sweet gesture of cake from the restaurant itself and song by the staff making it more special and the varieties of kulfis,5,
"good service very good receiving nature
very well satisfied with his service and the food
outstanding service by azad hussain with good responsibility towards customers",5,
loved the food ambience is good deserts could be somewhat better but overall i would recommend this place staff is friendly chicken is the best of all the dishes they serve,4,
"this was my first time at a barbeque nation i have heard great things about it people sounded like they serve food from heaven
now let me tell you about my experience at this outlet not going to judge the other outlets the service was not good we had to call em more than thrice to get the starters served the chicken tasted stale fish and prawns were amazing though they were serving complimentary drinks i selected ice tea worst one i have ever had
the good thing about this place their manager he knew we werent happy tried his best to make things right for us made the chef come to our table which felt good and cared for
i liked the ambience of this place will definitely give another chance to this outlet ",3,
"i visited this branch for independence day lunch with two of my friends as usual barbecue nation was superb at its food and service people in hyderabad prefer ab is over bn but somehow i felt bn is still a better place staff members were really good and everything was so delicious we really enjoyed our time there thumbs up ",5,
it is always good to visit this place we celebrate some of our most precious days good quality and service is excellent i wish you keep this quality always,5,
service was excellent and staffs were much polite frequent visits by chef to make sure taste is acceptable was laudable but after a point it had bit vexed us ambiance was good but space was very less hence during weekends it sounds like bring in a market,4,
food is excellentambience is very goodloved the greek festivalazad hussian gave us a very good serviceoverall experience is excellent,5,
"amazing food and ambience
starters were simply delicious
desserts were also really good
would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place",5,
"unlimited bbq food with delicious desserts
ambiance
barbeque nation is located near wipro lake exactly beside deli 9 bistro this outlet of barbeque nation is quite congested as it is situated at the ground floor indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 810 people per table they play silent english songs in the background
food
as we have arrived before 7pm we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails they served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque as we were six members they brought 2 barbeques in the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns chicken fish mutton paneer potatoes corns we had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours after that we moved towards the soup they have only one non veg and one veg soup we requested for hot and sour soup so they prepared for us in main course they served veg as well as non veg curries chinese and biryani finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis ice creams gulab jamun pastries firni and brownies
service
service was very quick and the staff was very good chef himself came to our table to take the feedback",4,
the service is too good if you are not satisfied with any food item basudev will recook as per your wish and serves it again the service is just excellent compared to other outlets,5,
food was tasty staffs were very friendly although the options in main course as well as for starters was a bit less and service was relatively slow when compared to other barbeques still would recommend to visit once,4,
"visited it along with my friends for lunch today
most of the staters were served was of same taste n less grilledfish n chicken n prawn everything tastes sameafter repetative reminder also they served the samealso there is not much varieties are available for statermain course is okdeserts are patheticthey are serving it for namesakeit is a horrible experience overall",1,
"i visited today  to be honest it is waste of money  everything that they serve tastes the same  there is no variety of tastes fish and chicken almost tastes similar it is like they have put the same spices on fish  chicken  mushroom and prawns deserts are simply the worst it is like just name sake they are serving 
for those who want to taste something good it is not recommended",1,
"i went there with my parents and it was totally worth it the service was extremely good and my parents loved every bit of it
starters and dessert always amazing
main course have a lot of varities but we always fill ourselves with starters that no place is left in stomach to try main course
overall it has been one of my favourite place ",5,
qutub yasin  it was really an awesome experience with these guys he was really friendly and we had a very good conversation him i will come back hungry for more,5,
"barbeque nation absolutly great place to dine with frinds r family
buffet was simply mouth watering food
ambince superb
service great 
great exprince we had
we want to visit again ",4,
went for lunch along with wife and bro for birthday lunch and lunch was perfect and had some decent items on menu gopal took good care of us i would recommend this place for great lunch,4,
"excellent service and food buffet this place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise the pocket pinch is slightly higher but it is totally worth it

then best starters are cajun potato crispy corn mushrooms dahi kebabs corn tikki all the starters are lipsmacking make sure to keep room for the main course

i have not tried many options from the main course though dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice

coming to desserts gal jamuns are literally out of the world try them with a scoop of vanilla icecream you wouldnt want to eat them anywhere else alongside pan kulfi is a must try  there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from

always up for a barbque grill ",5,
"visited it along with my friend for dinner buffet last week 

most of the starters were served slowly even after repetitive reminding no response from the staff fish starters were not well cooked chicken starters  crispy corn were good

mains and desserts were good as usual not much different from others",3,
more expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place you will realise why it is worth every penny from the starters to the main course everything was rich in flavour and taste softest mutton sheekh kebab ever i tasted here the menu did not include mutton keema yet our waiter gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan his hospitality is worth mentioning the head chef came and took our feedback very warm ambience good people and great food do not miss this place,5,
barbeque was good in taste quality of fish chicken mutton was perfect though main course variety was less overall i liked the place diligent service by all staffs the head chef also wanted feedback for the food which i personally like very much happy to visit another time,4,
"good food i visited 4 times and i like the food good hospitality ambiance is ok
deserts was mouthwateringi will definitely visit again thanks for making my day special 
all the best",4,
it is a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation i should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention the main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package it is a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals birthday celebrations or friends hangout,4,
we went here from office a group of 17 members we were the first so seating was not an issue i had veg starters and it was marvellous for once the spice levels matched my lower than normal hyderabad spice margins the paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire the corn fried were very good food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup desserts we very good on the whole a satisfying experience,4,
always good  for non veg starters are too good than veg  still overall it is good  always biryani will be same kasmiri flavoured  hope next time i may get new flavoured biryani  rest all staff and service were good,4,
barbeques are one of my favorites barbeque nation is a perfect blend of good food and ambience always been best at servicing would be better if they try something new for birthday wishes,4,
"quick review points
 slippery floor  be careful when you good with high heels or children perhaps they do not have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place
 bathrooms meant for rotten rats dirty washroom and tiny doors hefties and jumbo sizes you can not get in
 service  ohhh they can not handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up for sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter but service time and order time is pathetic
 advance bookings  they do not understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in
 pan kulfi it should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color pathetic and not worth giving tough time to your taste buds",2.5,
food is good the service from the staff is excellent worth every rupee reasonable price when compared to other barbeque service from the staff is excellent,5,
serving is nicefood is good starters are good enough to get a 3 star main course is excellent when compared to absolute barbecues but star of the show is malai kulfiabsolute showstopper of the buffet,4,
"barbeque is are famous for their huge spread in the starters range so was this place have almost visited most of the barbeques in the city similar menu and nothing outstanding in this restaurant taste was average
staff were very polite and the service was good loved the pan kulfi",3,
good place for birthdays and similar events wide variety of food items available had visited the place during some fest wherein i found lots of varieties,4,
"visited this place on our marriage anniversary food was excellent especially the starters liked the mutton sheek kebab more meat was tender and tasty bbq prawns were good as well veggies will love crispy corn here can improve on the desserts variety
service was excellent right from the valet guy to the manager every one were courteous
azad who served food for us was very assistive and always checked if we needed anything chef was kind enough to ask us about the food and cooked chicken specially for us which was terrific all seemed perfect for a perfect day",4,
"one of the best place i have ever went to buffet especially the great service provided by the agents over there  it really impressed it was on my birthdae  april 2 sorry for the late review
starting from welcome drink till the complimentary cake  the food was so delicious great job ",5,
"have been there for our wedding anniversary excellent service provided be staff non veg starters were too good ambiance was also good did not feel the main course that great compared to starters didnt like chicken dum biryani enjoyed desserts a lot especially kulfi

thank staff for helping us and celebrating our event ",4,
"you guys are really awesome what else a foodie like me can expect for lunch good food and great hospitalityi should take a minute from my routine to appreciate the service and hospitality provided by mr vibhishan and mr susheel
though you are the best the curiousness to improve by incorporating inputsfeedback from customers by you are great",5,
"a place to go with friends and family hospitality is just at the next level staffs are very polite and know how to delight the customers well starters and deserts are simply awesome i do not munch much on the main course not enough space left after yummy starters
i liked the way staff took my concern regarding pastry where i felt contained an egg i am vegetarian they not only ensured me that the said pastry is egg less but also offered me special chocolate chips icecream you guys are just too good in the hospitality will love keep coming back there",5,
"numerous options grilled chicken and prawn  all the kulfis in different flavors are tasty pineapple jalebi was very different but okz in tastea perfect place to satisfy ur hunger with great food  ambiance and service

great staff the service is very good you can ask them to serve the starters according to ur taste requirement spicy or mild please do the advance booking as it have rush on all the days",5,
i have visited barbeque nation multiple times and it has been beyond my expectations every time i love the items which they keep on their grills especially the nonvegetarian ones in the nonveg ones i most like their prawns and the fish i had forgot to mention the service and the ambience the service is good and even the ambience is great in of the grill i like the crispy corn and  the and some aloo thing they serve it is always awesome as we went there on jewel of the sea festival i had got crab curry with no flesh in it and we had butter naan and tandoori roti crab curry was not so great but nice the butter naan was great and even the tandoori roti was nice we even went for curd rice and dal makhni both of them were nice my overall experience with barbeque nation was awesome,4,
"service was pathetic ordered a sizzler with lamb was told no lamb ordered another sizzle with noodles it took 15 mins to serve that one also served it with rice instead and when i asked to change they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce i sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such

no apologies nothing from there side when asked for manager told me he is not here

prakash was not helpful or apologetic he just denied that he never served it
benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup",2,
i ordered a chicken american chopsey and they gave me this there was no noodles in it nor soup the dish was more of a chicken salad wrong order delivered,1,
"great place  awesome ambience and food  staff is good and seafood delight is a must try also sizzling chicken  come for budget lunch with your girlfriend ",5,
when we first tried that was 8months back the food taste and the quantity was good now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food very disappointed on my next two visitsthey started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their sizzlers seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract,3,
visited for lunch today with colleagues and ordered one spicy chicken sizzler combo and two buffets the buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler  though without the sides fries veggies and noodlesrice the buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions  perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet,4,
"thanks thanks thanks ones again thank you for your such a hospitality  it is great place to dine
food was delicious even service also wow
we want to visit again

highly recommend ",5,
"we are waiting for long time for this restaurant to dine

highly recommend for this restaurant",5,
"its nice place to dine for team lunch 
great service
great food

nice ambiance
we want to visit again we loved service thanks team absolute",5,
"i went here earlier some time back and was really impressed loved the sizzlers so i recommended it for a team lunch they preferred buffet so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers we went ahead with the buffet the most disappointing part was  despite a reservation for 1230 pm nothing was served till 1255
no body even looked at the table as they did not want to even respond we can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable we had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready
finally they served and none of us liked the food all they could relish was coke and gulab jamun
even if the food was not good i would not give such rating but the service is very disappointing
if if there is an issue we would be glad to understand the reason for delay but being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected
do not think i would go back there again",1,
"its great place dine absolute sizzler absolutely great place to dine with family and friends

today lunch we visited with family we had great experiences  we loved the food n service we want to visit again",5,
"i am sorry but this is not the right place for online orders i did not get my complete order and what i received was also not what i had ordered for and nothing was done apart from receiving z credits because that is only what zomato can do
check your orders before you send it to the customer",1,
"how do you expect me to be nice when the food i ordered when i am literally hungry came spoiled and the zomato support people are not of any help
i need my money back",1,
"went with family on a week day we ordered the below

exotic vegetable pasta 355  this can be better

veg sizzler with baked beans 45

paneer butter masala sizzler 35  asked for less spicy but it was spicy somehow could not enjoy the taste 100

cottage cheese steak sizzler 455

fresh lime soda 35  i can make better soda at home

ambience 45

overall it was a decent experience so rating 38 but things can be improved",4,
good sizzler taste portion size may be too much for a single person they were kind enough to share all the sauces extra to mix and have different tastes,3,
"went for team outing here
all sizzlers pretty are same here just main indegridint changes the service is a bit slow ambience is nice there brownie sizzler is good the staff is courteous",4,
they delivered a stale food at night when ordered from zomato i paid inr 400 for stale food and when i tried calling restaurant had closed no one helped,1,
"cool place to party with friends family good choice of sizzlers available juice  smoothies also available little more care will make them perfect suggesting to place cabage leaves over sizzler plate to avoid colour change of lower level food wash room at inconvenient place found lot of delivery boys near counter
i visited on 26th feb for my daughters birthday dinner",4,
super sizzlers with decent staff and offers are enough to njoy the place  all should go there to have tasty sizzlers i will visit again,5,
you hear about a place a 100 times how do you solve the puzzle when you visit it once to experience it yourself being a foodie it is important we suss things out in person one of the puzzle i came across was this place absolute sizzler i had mixed reviews and i said let metry been here and loved the place people have lot of different views and takes on sizzler is and how they expect it to be like a dhaba style  here it is a fusion of both desi and videsi tadkaa so keep an open mind to ravish some delicious sizzlers i give a happy 45,4,

worst place to have a sizzler tried hyderabadi sizzler which was just rotten chicken biriyani on a hot plate the noodles in the veg sizzler were very bad as well these guys dont know how to make a sizzler the staff was also not well trained,1,
as a sizzlers fan went to longe my taste buds with sizzlersorder fish n chips along with chilly chicken for straters and oh my fell in love with fish n chips chicken sizzlers were really gud loved the ambience and the music worth visiting the place fish n chips are must try,4,
sizzlers are really good here but one must have knowledge what they want exactly along with sizzler otherwise it is hard to finish it of and also need to update the order with pice level for spice lovers,4,
the mixed biryani is good but need to improve the presentation and the portion the pieces are not cooked properly better to check this except that all ok,3,
"it was my first time to taste this dish and totally satisfied i cut down that 5th star because it lacks spice and realized that there are spicy sauces that can be added to the dish after our plates were empty
good ambience and service",4,
friendly staff good food and ambience on 2 occasions i have had the chance to enjoy their sizzlers and prawns and both times i enjoyed the experience,5,
it is a very good place for sizzelers loved the person who was singing der a very good experience overall loved the food and the food was served on time and food was amazing it was a very good experience for my family and me i would recommend this place to all my friends and aqueitence,5,
simple place but very tasty sizzlers portioning for the sizzlers are also excellent service was also good i tried one of the chicken sizzlers and loved the plating and all the added stuff that came along,4,
this is the best place for those who live sizzlers which is best and cheaper food in this place is good but the deli ery of the food is bit slower as compared to other,4,
vegetables are not cooked properly waste of money,1,
"thay serving great lunch buffet food was superb

i have order veg sizzler but and they served me the non veg sizzler i had it without knowing it the server was rude unpolite and refused to accept his mistakes and even manager to the same extent there is no proper communication between chef and server it was worst experience in my life as i am a pure vegeterian i would recommend not to visit this place i would choose negative rating as a best option,1,
"its great palace to dine food was great
service also good
ambiance also cool we want visit again
especially spice chicken sizzlers
thanks team absolute sizzler

went to this for an office lunch the time taken to get the food out is unbelievably high on top of this a vegetarian colleague was told that the food is vegetarian and got served chicken instead never coming back,1,
"absolute sizzlers located at snl terminals level 3

amazing food tasty finger food i recommend cheese stuffed mushroom  fish n chips and many more to try
when coming to sizzlers fish shashlik sizzler is the best
must try caramel custard and sizzling brownie dessert

 highly recommended best sizzlers restaurant
we will visit again",5,
"we had a very bad experience here we have ordered fish shashilk and sizzling chicken sizzlers the fish shashilk sizzler did not have fish in it upon asking the waiter he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that i had already not eaten it he then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can not be remade because the kitchen was quite busy upon arguing another person came and changed my sizzler i had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites mistakes can happen anytime anywhere it is an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers

i would have given one star but one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler",2,
prakash served us food  he is very generous and did tell us the speciality  must try grilled chicken sizzler and sizzling brownie they are just awesome,5,
sizzlers are too good prakash served it really well and explained about the food is really impressive must try here the grilled chicken sizzler and the sizzling brownie,5,
food was too good tried spicy chicken sizzler and lal maans lamb sizzler liked the behaviour of prakash will recommend it to friends and visit again,5,
"best sizzlers in hyderabad till date very good staff service i love this place

grilled fish sizzler is mouth watering you can try seekh kebab paneer tikka sizzler also time if you are a vegan",5,
worst food and service after long waiting we got the food we ordered starters and sizzler they prepared the food and forgot i think this is the first i have seen a place with starters in cold stage been to this place for more than 10 times and never had complaints on food but today is nightmare worst food and their best item is chicken shashlik sizzler which is worst today bye bye absolute,1,
"this place is good for a casual lunch and dinner with friends or family this place offers a wide variety of sizzlers and other starters and main course as well  during my last 2 visits i have tried a non veg platter 23 different types of nonveg sizzlers tikka pizza with addons like fries  n all

while the food they serve is good but they could do better with service
service is not up to the mark  once your order is taken it is lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table after 20 mins  and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how is the food well not just that ask for a chutney or mayonnaise or a water bottle you aint getting it until you call up to them couple of times",4,
"food is incredible i have visited several times but still the menu has lot of items to cover the staff is very friendly and shravan kumar is very much good at his service and also in ambience a must visit place
spicy chicken sizzler with noodles is ultimate here",5,
"the place where to dine finely and with good ambience treating very well with their service
as well as delicious food these things we could find only at the absolute sizzlers",5,
"been here on a sunday for dinner not a great ambiance buffet was not pretty good so preferred ala carte ordered 3 starters pepper chicken honey chilli potato and veg seekh kabab kabab was not cooked well remaining were good in taste no good options in desserts
starters 355
soup 35
ambiance 25
staff behavior 45",3,
"spacious ambience amazingly friendly staff quick service good food i ordered cottage cheese steak sizzler garlic sauce base with noodles and fries the steak was delicious fries were crispy noodles were bland had to ask for extra garlic sauce one sizzler is enough for any individual with a decent appetite may visit this place if you are craving for sizzlers

might burn your pocket if you do not have zomato gold",4,
"awesome food great taste and great people good ambiance waiters are soo kind sravan is really soo nice  my fav is pasta here  read sauce creamy pasta ",5,
"value for money  yummy sizzlers at throwaway prices however decking up of the restaurant as well as air conditioning does not seem to work too well overall a very good deal at the offered prices
ps please increase the sizzling menu and decrease indian servings since this place is meant to serve sizzlers absolutely cheers",4,
"ambience and taste of food in this restaurant was good
 worth if you have zomato gold too shankar who served us very polite will be visiting once again soon",5,
not worth visiting waited for a very long time about half an hour people who know what a sizzler is will not like it for sure i think restaurant name should be changed as they have buffet and other indian food in the menu,2,
"i would like to share my dine experience at the absolute sizzler
really nice i felt very happy with their hospitality and service food and ambaence as well as
over all good ",5,
"where the place seems to be attractive with a nice ambience and as well as tasty food to dine over here that is only the absolute sizzlers

i have ordered 3 hyderabad dum biryani costing rs 300 per biryani in total rs 900
quantity is very less and with no quality all mutton pieces are waste peaces
i called up hotel to inform the same but they are not responding
poor service and poor quality
only 1 person can eat rs 300 biryani  very upset",1,
the sizzlers here are unlike any other place just amazing i have had the ohris sizzlers and they were okay but the sizzlers are better at absolute sizzlers and lesser at price most visit for some sizzle,5,
i would give a better review if the food was at least doable the place lacks ambience and there were a lot of minor inconveniences due to communication problems,1,
bad food bad ambience bad service clueless waiters and expensive food such a waste of money everything was bad i regret going to this place,1,
the place serves below average food the place is supposed to specialize in sizzlers but that did not taste good either to add up the waiters were totally clueless utter waste of money,1,
"mostly overrated

went with my wife today by seeing the 39 stars the place is small and too much crowded there are very less number of servers compared to footfalls now coming to food ordered chicken drumsticksbut taste was not that great then ordered one non veg sizzler which was also not that great noodles in the sizzler were tasteless overall did not find the experience which we were expecting",3,
this is the worst pasta i have ever hadpasta is sweet and dry and not even cutlery oregani or chillifslkes are provided never order,1,
i had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce i wouldnt say it was the worst but it was not up there there was no smokiness like the name claimed just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that did not really need to be there in it in the first place i would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no of vegetables maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out also the smoked chicken needs to be upgraded the spaghetti was also slightly overcooked,3,
"i have been here twice

"it was an ok ok place ambiance was quite ok
every item in the menu was costly and the sizzler was also not upto the mark
serving was a bit slow and preparation time was high more or less it was not a fine dining experience",3,
"ordered 3 sizzlers
starting with spicy chicken sizzlers it is the best among what we had ordered
for veg lovers must try the veg satellite sizzlers you would find it really worth it
and then we had chicken manchurian sizzlers which indeed was also nice
i found this the best place for trying sizzlers
worth the money and
had a good service from shravan kumar",5,
"a friday outing in absolute sizzlers quite pocket friendly option even more if you have zomato gold
had ordered mushroom sizzler and chicken sizzler the portion is enough for 1 person we had ordered french fries as side dish
though i am dedicated nonveg lover i really loved the mushroom sizzler more than the chicken sizzler
a must visit around sln teriminus",4,
we went for lunch and ordered two sizzlers veg and non veg both were not up to the mark taste was not good and portion size was less not enough veggies in the dish but one good thing i liked the ambience need to improve loads on the taste part,1,

where would like to have delicious food and good ambience seems and their service as well as i found these things at the absolute sizzlers only and they use to provide us nice buffet with 50 percent off on buffet that too very reasonable cost this is really good thing i loved it,5,
"i have had high expectations of food there but then my green salad with mint sauce was not very good while the chicken wings i ordered were nice but they ruined the american chopsuey it was more like eating a soupy noodles than a chopsuey i wish they would have made that better
ambience was good staff were okay",2,
"whoever people looking for delicious food and humble service at the place of absolute sizzler only i can say that i had good experience there especially i heard about that discount on ala carte menu and on the buffet 50off that was really cool and great dine to have at that reasonable price number of buffet items which were making us feel tasty thanks to absolute sizzler is ",5,
this place is amazing for weekend fun hangouts and let your tireness go away the dj is awesome and plays best bollywood songs and punjabi too the veg pizza and pastas are pretty good to try along with fruit punch but if you want to have a good fun filled and energetic time go here this place the best music to groove to and has pretty ambience to get clicked,4,
this is what we were served today when we ordered for grilled paneer i think this was someone is left over which we were served giving the benefit of doubt that they might have made some mistake i informed them that it might be a mistake but the manager said that they did not have enough plated to serve and hence they served it like this after a lot of arguments they finally decided to change it but the story does not end here they served us ice cold paneer in a different plate i will just finish my beer and leave now,1,
i am absolutely in love with this place not much hyped but still crowded i recommend to visit on weekdays and weekends can get overcrowded pizza was good so were the other titbits but what i liked most was there service took time to place the order at the pos but the bartender whipped up my drink in no second bad i never had to call out for a repeat it was ready each time overall i go to this place every other week one of the best party place around,5,
been to this place along with friends for a small partywe loved the place  but only concern was service associates were rude helplesswhen we complained for burned naan was served then the server stated that we serve naan likes this onlyhe didnot even apologisedvery pathetic experience we had,3,
this place is absolutely mindblowing great music great service great food it is crowded because so many wanna be here is so epic if you wanna spend some good time with your friends dance your heart out and blow off some steam the lal street is the place for you,4,
i had gone to this place for team dinner the place is in a mall and has a good ambience we ordered many starters and drinks the food was decent nothing special it is a good place to party and dance,3,
"worst service experienced ever
nobody is concerned about even taking the order
its just waste of our evening
not as expected
this review is completely for the service we received",1,
i have been to this place with friends for friday night the place has amazing vibes they were playing awesome bollywood numbers the place was so crowded that it is do difficult to find a place to chill getting a table is task food is also good one advice go a little early you will get place and even drinks will be at decent prices,4,
apparently that is their garnish oh yeah the orange peel on the plate was my drink the dustbin lol  oh wait i guess maybe i never had a cocktail that is what the waiter said horrible service the guy was not ready to even call the manager,1,
"this was a good place cozy and outside seating arrangement was romantic amazing place for the gettogethers and for a bunch of friends food was okay we had nachos the salsa can taste better a bit it was bland

this place is stupid and extremely discriminating  as a guy you are not allowed to enter the dance floor  the bouncers are hostile and say that unless you have a girl  you cannot enter the dance floor  i understand there might be instances of guys misbehaving but the attitude of the management towards people is extremely hostile  i am never coming here,1,
"went for lunch with friends
service and ambiance are good i personally liked mocktail while food can be better
the taste was not great while quantity is okay",4,
the lady bouncer aunty with glasses at the desk did not allow us to go inside as we were wearing slides she referred the slides as slippers straight to our faces they should have mentioned about shoes in zomato app i feel so sad about the half knowledge of the aunty at the reception desk will never visit this place ever,1,
"friday night visited there with my girl gang i had booked the table in order to avoid any hastle was seated in a quiet corner on the deck side of the space i loved the food they served each and every item the dj for that night was very good and we danced till the last song only the service a bit dissatisfying because the bill was generated incorrectly and over the amount what we had consumed expect better care to be taken ",4,
"it was a night out with gal pals

when we entered the server took us to our sitting area  we chose a corner as it had a couch felt it was bit secluded

warm indoors black and brown seatings cartoons of laal street their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the tv

they have their own app for ordering  but guess what their wifi was not available as it was under repair that is what server told us

the server came and took our orders

we ordered starters and drinks

as soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere

it kind of scared us  then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation

then we started enjoying the music and our orders came the server got one of the drinks wrong we reminded him it was changed he said he already brought this

other places the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast instead he said he cant take it back

anyways moving on

the cocktail which i had were really good the cosmopolitan beer trap and screw driver

the starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small i can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian italian cheese fingers  they were crispy and yum stuffed mushrooms  they were okay and forgettable the nachos were okay  have had better ones  the crispy corn was good  last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters

the music was good  being a bollywood night we requested dj to play it first they said at 930 they will start then said 1030 it will start we four were only on the dance floor  we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song he didnt oblige at all

would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills  god knows

food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar

hope they improve their hospitality that is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again

they always deny the table on weekends or friday even though we book on zomato or other apps due to high demand this is not fair if we did a pre booking,1,
went here on a thursday the staff were really pathetic in service and no zomato gold etc were eligible they could have responded in a proper way when asked why it is not valid since it is ladies night,2,

"good place to hangout with friends nice music nice ambience nice food
it also has a outdoor seating so one who likes to have that seating it is also a good place with good atmosphere
its a bar exchange so order wisely that is the only thing to take care of
if you are traveling to hyd and do not want to go any random place for pubbing you surely can rely on this place",4,
"to enter this bar you have to go from the main entrance of the mall there is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear you may find it little bit awkward

coming to the bar interior it is spacious different seating arrangement outdoor included you better book table before reaching otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends we booked in advance but still we did not get the one with sofa we got the table with bar chairstall

we ordered singapore noodles mixed fried rice chicken wet and white sauce pasta

singapore noodles  55
mixed fried rice  55
chicken wet  45
white sauce pasta  25
they did not have pizza on the day we went

music they played good english songs early and followed by hindi songs songs were very good

drinks  you have to order through their app so we had to install and order it was not very convenient the price of drinks on the menu in zomato has no relation with the actual price cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu

recommended",4,
"nice place to be super good food and drinks friendly staff cool ambiance enjoyed our time here

ok that is itjust trying fulfill the 140 characters rule ",5,
good concept based on some other existing clubs though there is a serious need of utilizing the space properly which at present requires quite some work limited dance floor have to be protected by bouncers everybody blocks the road after last call but ignoring all that food is good music is good and projector is okaish,4,
"the lal street is awesome for food and beverages one of the best place to hangout with friends the prices are decent so one can try here
the dance floor is good and no restrictions for stages to dance on the floor
the waiters are too friendly they suggest better than any others bars",5,
bunch of hypocrites one cannot enter unless they have a girl beside them one cannot enter unless they have shoes tied to their feet one cannot enter unless their lower limbs are fully covered for guys we pay you to get us drunknot to judge us based on our footwear and whom we tag along you think someone without shoes can not behave or pay you the bill pathetic stereotypes,1,
went on a dry day still the service was good the music and the dj is really good we had fun they have a fairly big dance floor which is a nice touch with cool graffiti,4,
ordered chicken pizza  missal pav and cocktails missal pav was ok but the chicken pizza was just too good ambience is awesome and unique,4,
few of my favourite places in hyderabad wide range of food and drinks available the taste of food is above average can get cocktails and beer at a very descent price 810 on the ambiance,4,
the best outlet and with lower prices we get best service no need of any zomato gold it self huge place and who lovers watch matches when drink best place undoubtedly recommended,5,
this place is fun awesome ambience food is great staff is interactive drinks are ok not expensive overall nice place to chill out and fun,4,
"great place with good food and ambience we ordered a pizza and an italian finger sticks both were very good specially the italian finger sticks
the staff were polite and food was serviced quiet fast
overall a nice place to hangout",4,
since its close to the it crowd been here numerous times i like the music and drinks as well food is not their fort you have to be very selective in that would recommend to go for starters i have tried buffet here as well which i did not personally like the ambience is cool though but the staff has been unaccommodating to us one time,3,
"went there on a weekday but being a ladies night the place had a decent crowd it is a bar exchange so you order the drinks on the app food was okay we ordered chicken pizza pop corn chicken nachos chicken wings taste could have been better

service was way too slow we had to wait 40 minutes for a single dish the drinks menu on the app is good but they never have enough stock so do not even bother going here for drinks single guys are not allowed on the dance floor bbq chicken wings was putrid worst of all look at the picture i attached they cheat you by giving you smaller shot glasses when you are very drunk horrible experience,1,
nice place and competitive pricing i am always a fan of the the concept by which these guys operate food is good specially biryani didnt expect such great biryani at a pub,4,
we are the regular for this pub from beginningtoday we have visited this place  waiting more than 30 minutes for our order to place they are being in confusion to take the order i felt like we are treated like beggars and there is no proper grooming with staff  i did not saw proper response paid for a customer  as usual the food is good dj was good with nice songsthis time the overall experience was totally bad,1,
horrible experience wouldnt want to come here ever again horrible food horrible service extremely disappointed with the entire package,1,
the rooftop of the place is quite good but only drawback is that the place is small thus it was overcrowded and there was little place to move,3,
"you wanna dance with these crazy people around get in  loud music inside so i like it outside nice open area be there if you are looking for some place in gachibowli otherwise i would prefer jubilee or banjara

"one of the best bars i have visited in hyderabad so farit has a quirky concept of
barexchange

its a great place to hangout and party with ur friends has a groovy music and a big dance floor it also has an option of open air and this place is crowded on weekends
it is all based on the demand and supply that day
a large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day in real time all you need to do is download their app which also shows you the trading board and use it to place your order
the food is acceptably good and service is quick",4,
awesome pub with great ambience liquor prices go up and down based on demand like sensex nice concept pub service is also good seperate dance floor one of the unique feature,5,
the place is mostly crowded on the weekends it is better to go with a prior reservation prices are a little high music is good service is slow dishes could taste better,3,
"i have ordered food couple of times from this place but never been there mostly i used to order thali for lunch which was worthy this was my first physical visit to the restaurant and i was very amazed to see all the glory around me ambience look coziness and lighting all were so perfect the soft couches were so comfortable then moving to the food i ordered chicken steak platter this contained two portions chicken breast mashed potato stir fried veggies and rice the quantity was enough to fill the belly further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy it was not spicy not salty with all balance flavours in drinks i had virgin pina colada well blended coconut cream and sweetness i found this place very nice to hang out with friends it is not family friendly staff is courteous there are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place

ambience  45 out of 5

food  4 out of 5 cost could be lower side slightly

staff service  5 out of 5",4,
been here many time and really like the place for drinks and finger foods crowd generally come around 10pm dj is also nice bar tenders are really cool and friendlyone mushroom coated one i remember which i order every time that beats the nonveg starters too,5,
u can try just for different environment food is just ok i tried paneer tikka corn chicken manchurian pepper chicken go in happy hours,3,
loved their dance floor and drinks menu would highly recommend the blue curacao for mocktails and their cosmo for the cocktail their pasta is one of the best preparations in my opinion definitely recommend a revisit,5,
"have been a number of times to the lal street 
i have loved the ambience here the crowd was pretty good and had a great time it would have been better if i would have got table  as i had made reservations the dj was just fine and was playing too many old songs",4,
it is a good place with bollywood mix musicgood place for basic chill scenes with friendsit had a decent dance floor good food and drinks,5,
lal street management did not allow us  zomato does not mention stags are not allowed here in the app i went there and came back is it a girl required to enter lal street crazy,1,
went there on an ipl night music and ambience is nice we ordered drinks and a couple of starters such as stuffed mushroom chicken in black bean sauce jalapeno poppers and a fish dish all the dishes were good but the jalapeno poppers and stuffed mushroom were impressive the service is slow though and ordering drinks on the app might become a challange at times overall a nice place to hangout,4,
"interesting cocktail menu which a wide range of starters to try there is a constant live screen showcasing the trading prices to drinks available ",3,
"filtered entry  check
welcome assistance  check
crowd  check
ambience  check

what is great nothing

it is a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money half the order does not come on time you will have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time

the fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered too many people are stiffed inside and i do not think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract

overall i liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night we left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night

the cocktails are good though",3,
a great party place and a decent size dance floor to try out all your new moves and get loose the food is tasty and love the concept of ordering drinks via app as per drink exchange rate,4,
grate place for food lovers the tempting and mouth watering dishes are speechless loved the ambiance and the vibe of the place surely recommended for its food and ambiance,4,
"we are here on thursday night and place was empty at the time we reached but they says every table is reserved  so we found a place finally and ordered maggi pizza which took them 40 minutes to serve by that time we loose our appetite  even customer service is late  food was good but they did not accept dine out pay ",2,
"good ambience good food good dance place

three of us girls went to this place on a rainy friday evening and it turned out to be good fun we ordered

white sauce pasta it was awesomely tasty the sauce was made correctly with the right consistency there were vegetables in it

nachos with sauce again another yummy dish though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of nachos but overall the dish was delicious and worth it

chicken kebabs just wow the best dish of the evening for us soft succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniyapudina chutney made it worth the money

we also ordered beer virgin mojito good and a pineapple mocktail very bad  pure waste of money

it also has a good dance place furthermore the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers to which we grooved until the end

all in all an awesome experience and i would have given 5 stars but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star",4,
ambiance staff environment was all set to peaks music was much much appreciated i was been there on ladies night but that does not stopped stags to get in and the crowd was amazing best bar stock exchange witnessed up to now we had a very good day watching ipl match,5,
"amazing place
the ambience is good and the music is even great
i have been here thrice in the past three weeks and it turned out to be pretty amazing experience always

their exchange system of liquor pricing is quite good and affordable to most
i have even had jameson for 140 bucks a peg 
their lit is effective 

i have tried their chicken tikka biryani and hot asian noodles
chicken tikka biryani was amazing i loved it

"the music was over the top and it has a decent dance floor food was good and this place accepts zomato gold 11 offer as it is a bar exchange you will get to enjoy drinks at lower cost as well ",5,
"i can not tell you how awesome the food has been i ordered chinese choupsey and hot asian noodles with a roasted veg shack damn i was shook at the quantity because it was a lot for 2 people absolutely loveddddddd how it tasted i cannot begin to explain the amazing taste of the sauted and partially barbecued flavor of the vegetables i am a pure vegetarian and lal exchange is now my fav place to eat now ",5,
"got a chance to visit this place with team such a superb place to hangout i recommend this place for partiesto watch cricket on big screen  have fun and best place to spend time with friends the starters were too good drinks are okay and biryani can be betteri know many people do not visit this place for biryani

"the ambience is very nice the place has both indoor and outdoor setting the staff is polite
the food however did not excite me much the music was average and the rate fluctuations for drinks the main concept of the place seemed more static and less interesting
the cocktails did not taste that well either we ordered a chicken noodles did not taste as per the grandeur of the place the biryani was good we also ordered lits which were not up to the mark at all",3,
a good place to hangout they have indoor as well as outdoor seating live matches on big screens are quite engaging starters are appreciable specially tandoori malai brocolli,4,
bad customer service first we booked table near screen still they did not give and they make people stand near screen how the hell should we watch the match people go to see match and they do this,2,
"although we booked our table the suitable table couldnt be found for us one guy passed to another one and we sat outside after this they send inside finally the table was found for us
we ordered jgermeister and baileys but we had nuts for the prices 375 and 450 see the portion
ok i understand that prices are fluctuates but we did not know that we paid for this little shots these drinks serves with proper glass with ices bigger portions this is charging
will never visit this place again",1,

one of the worst service ever i recieved today i do not wana refer anyone to this place i contacted the lal street they told me about the happy hours menu and after going there tha menu has been totally changed i e from 11 to 99 and i didnt like this and worst ever service,1,

very recommended place for goout with buddies to have some special time
i love the mrp night
chillout longnight",4,
"this is one good pub that can make your evening
went for my birthday the food is good and so are the drinks made better by zomato 22

the music was good and had a great time dancing to the numbers dj was playing

overall you will be satisfied and would want to stay longer",4,
"have been to this place

ambience  took up the seat in the outdoor area loved the place and the music beats

service  staff person was santosh he was very efficient and courteous

food  ordered white sauce pasta misal pav bombay sandwich and drinks

misal pav is great but a suggestion here increase the quantity of misal in the plate the taste was real good

pasta was amazing loved the crunchiness of veggies

bombay sandwich  initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be osum green chutney turned its magic on

definitely must visit place",5,
"i visited this place on last saturday and i really enjoyed the evening the best thing which i liked about the place was only groups and couples were allowed to enter the dancing floor which does not happen in delhi  i really liked the food and the crowd would love to visit again ",5,

"this place is something you can never get bored off groovy music good food and crowd is also nice   the lal street has a big dancing floor  ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also it is very crowded on weekends like anything

talking about the food this place is zomato gold food partner if you have it  you can enjoy the benefits
 chicken lolipop crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce
 masala papad  stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion
 cheesy pineapple sticks never ever order this it was pathetic 
 paneer lazeez  creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese highly recommended
 chicken tikka masala highly recommended
 cheese garlic naan and butter naan

overall my evening at lal was just amazing the service was really good you can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure mydj17",4,
"this was our second stop in same complex on saturday 3003 evening only reason i am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by gm of the joint given below so you guys decide the merits of place

went for outdoor sitting at 730pm suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two this is when all of 40 tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met gm of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason he was quite apologitic forced to come back in owner of the place forgot his name who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min
at 815 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor hence the futility of all the hoopla",2,
amazing place on weekends must visit if you have crazy set of friends to dance with i have been there several times and trust me it never disappoints me,5,
"went to this place it is a nice place but customer service is not good they accepted my table booking but later when i visit the place they did not allot me table u just have to hit the bar counter

note to manager if u can not provide table just do not accept it",1,
"ambience was good
but food in taste and quality was not up to the mark
also the service was poor waiters were not waiting properly you had to call everytime for small things like glasses or plates",2,
i liked the atmosphere of the restaurant the staff are friendly over all experience is ok i liked the starters it is ok with a group of 5 to be there,4,
good place to hangout its bit boring to order from apo though  food is okay okay we had many different chicken n veg starters dj kept atmosphere lively,3,
"the drinks were good the food was mediocre the service was pathetic
the waiter asked us when are we leave apparently they overbooked and even the service was slow",3,
"first of all special mention to santosh who really made our evening very best by his great service he was superb in taking our orders and serving really fast thank you santosh for it

now coming to fb though little priced on high end it was worth it every thing we ordered in veg non veg and drinks mocktails we are really good music was lovely ambience was perfect and above all i believe wednesday is ladies night so all the girls  ladies you know one place to go as well if you did not know so far like me 

overall very well spent time and gathered loads of memories as always will go again for sure just waiting for a reason if not will make one  ",5,
even though this place is huge we could not find a place to sit initially around 1030 we finally got a place to sit the food and the bar here is good and service was prompt once you get a table the dj played some nice bollywood songs overall it is a nice place but i would recommend to book a table before you go here if you are planning to visit on weekends,4,
"the dj who plays at this place is really good we went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot on the downside the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place

the people on bar counter suck big time as they do not talk properly give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available",3,
"the lal street is been good for the first time today i went and booked a table where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us where there was noone to entertain us and take our order we sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order then suddenly being saturday night the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side everyone want their saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears no doubt music played by dj was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor
food was fine though but ambience is good",3,
good place to hangout when you buddies and pals dj just turns on the dance floor place gets over crowded in weekends but the ambience makes you to stay and enjoy your drink,5,
"what an ambience it was a saturday evening on which we visited this place
it has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages we could order ourselves from the app

the lal street to be read as dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed 

in terms of food we ordered two preparations
cheese chilly toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies
the lal special pizza was not upto the mark coming from a reviewer from kolkata

if you hit the right price alcohol can be really cheap we ordered black dog triple gold reserve for around 180 inr 

it is definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food",4,
awsme place for hangout wid frnds and the joker poster was outstanding loved the place and service the guy who served us also worked well,4,
"this place is like home hindi dj songs will take u to next level croud is so decent nd friendly
food is awesome specially loaded french fries",5,
looks interesting at the entrance and has an intriguing ambience the food is good and staff is cooperative but less responsive the seating arrangement is comfortable for a person to relax the paneer kathi roll is a must have,3,
good food options and decent service is expensive and dark ambience during lunch time is not lively though i expect evenings would be crowded,4,
gives you the millennial pub vibe nice ambience and food the stock exchange theme always gives you a different and fun feel the crowd is also good one star is deducted for the service department which i felt needs some improvement,4,
"the best thing about tls is it is dj dj played a good collection of songs it has a separate dance floor which is a major plus point the ambience is good food is above average and service is prompt
a good place for sat nights",4,
the waiter here specially manager srini is worst and rude person here suggest never go to this place  they treat people as they are getting food for free,1,
visited here saturday evening place was full crowded and it took time to get a table though i have booked online drinks prices keeps changing here as stock market exchange prices which is speciality of the bar dance floor ambience music everything is so good here,4,
"the pricing here will be an interesting one to see the higher the drinks get sold the more the price is ambience looks decent and the dance floor is big
starters menu is good we had cheese balls and chicken started the pricing seems to be expensive on starters compared to other similar restaurants",4,
place was a complete let down was there for lunch on sunday and was disappointed the veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on saturday the only saving grace were the drinks so unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks skip the place,2,
great place awesome music and great ambiance but waiters are unfriendly though i can recommend this place for the fun atmosphere and good music,3,
been here on a sunday afternoon the place was quite empty as it was afternoon the starters n drinks are quite expensive but zomato gold is applicable so it became quite reasonable as we were only 2 people the ceaser salad here is the best i had in the city,5,
great ambience and their service was very good food was ok as i like less spicy and their food was very spicy liked that they too have bar exchange sort of thing enjoyed my visit must go atleast once,4,
it was excellent experience spiced thank krishna and monaj excellent food and service i am full happy enjoy the food and service thanks and team,5,
"excellent it was a great experience that i had there
krishna has taken care of us and the chef pankaj has served all the special dishes to us will go again soon",5,
visited ab is 3rd time and as always staff was very friendly and welcoming decent ambiance and wide variety of food it is a must visit for barbecue lovers,4,
"varun and sandeep done excellent job

"visited with office friends first things first the staff was very polite and prompt they kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us  we even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough the server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoilovercook the food but on insisting politely changed the barbecue

coming to the food
vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer  mushroom crispy corn potato etc for starters so yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too

non vegetarian starters had basic chicken tandoorileg fish prawns mutton seek kabab must try etc

the main course like any other buffet place was not that interesting noodles being one of my personal favourite were a little disappointing

the sweet section would make anyone happy a thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close the sweet cornor was refilled on time

again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience",4,

good atmosphere to eat with relaxtastes goodquality is goodgood serving and serving peoplegood experience every time when i go kfcwings are my ever favorite from kfc,4,
ordered zinger doubles and hot and crispy chickentaste was goodpackaging was very good i really liked the kfc sticker on the outside which made me assured food is not tampered withdelivery by zomato also on timejust hoping kfc would consider to bring out more option in grilled or baked chicken items so that food can be healthy,5,
no words very very very bad service i ever had i wish this outlet would close forever staff oh yeah staff they do not give a fuck to any customer because its a brand its kfc guys common no guys its kfc so one cares about review in zomato fuck this outlet,1,
chicken peaces not frided properallyand quantaty and quality are very badi am seriously disappointed for these orderwednes day offer so many peoples are exacted for u r offers but u r not mainted proper quailityi am really disappointedi never ever not ordered again,1,
burger was okaybut the chicken piece was not good and i was confused to find out which piece of chicken is thatso please look for a good piece of chicken when people ordering through online or else kfc will start loosing customers,3,
"decent ambience and setup lots of space which is kind of expected being a franchise

fast service but inefficient on multiple occasions they gave the wrong order",3,
i had bad experiences at this place multiple times the management has no sense of customer experience the people working there dont even respond to customers properly while ordering they do not check the inventory we had to wait for 30 min for order to be served and even after that there were some items missing when asked how long it would take they just responded vaguely iam not planning on visiting this place ever again,1,
"it was team outing party ambiance was great
the food was good and the service was too slow the main thing staff was very polite and smile face over all rating 29",3,
i have ordered from here using the zomato app the ordering was simple they responded very fast and i had the food delivered within 30 minutes of the order this was a happy experience the burgers were very good and the chicken legs still warm and succulent the rice with small chicken nuggets was also excellent though the quantity seems to be a little less,4,
service is very slow took more than 15 minutes to prepare the order and still the food was cold kfc quality has also gone down chicken was just okayish even ac is not working at the restaurant in peak summer time,2,
i have ordered zinger box meal the chicken inside is raw for the piece and the burger i do not recommend that this kfc is hygiene in cooking,1,
"do not know what is going wrong with kfc as a brand  they are doing it wrong in every aspect no proper management of customers on the counters the food they are serving is not upto the mark as it used to be i was a fan of kfc but slowly i am loosing interest in going i had a very bad experience the coke they served was very sweet without any soda in it  i though i was having a sweet water the chicken was not served hot the quality of the rice they are providing is going down day by day

management please look into this or else you will be loosing a lot of patrons it is high time to think",1,
on march 20th 2019 i have ordered 3 8 piece smoky grilled which is worth of 1857 rupees through zomato instead of getting three 3 8 piece order i was only given 2 8 piece order and 1 hot crispy i have called the customer care and i was assured call back but they didnt when i have approached zomato i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it here is the twist of the tale    instead of refund or replacement i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits i would really not recommend orders from this place as the customer treatment is pathetic since this is a corporate order i strongly recommend my food committee not to order anything from kfc in bulk,1,
worst service and i have spoke to the franchise owner and i know him in hyderabad he told me he can not do business with high quality ingredients please do not go to kfc restaurant,1,
i frequently order frm kfc and every time i come up with happinessi just love the chicken wings of kfcfood quality is so goodfresh rice bowlz spcly love the cookies biscuiti never got delayed my order the delivery boys are trainedthank you so much for providing us such a good food,5,
i ordered rice chicken porpcorn mealbox they only gave me the rice box no popcorn very bad experience i trusted this place i am very disappointed,1,
just like any other kfc the place is my backup option plan in case i dont have anywhere to go to or no food at home cheap tasty and especially good for cheat days,4,
"i do not understand if they do not want to deliver why kfc shows as available
everytime i place order most of the time it get declined after payment i am not worried about refund as it comes but food is all about cravings and i did order very hopefully but disappointed in the end
food is always good from kfc but delivery service is worst",1,
we have got wrong order,1,
"i ordered big 8 meal they cheated sent me just big 8 bucket
i will never order here again
they should at least read the order correctly",1,
i have been to this place and also ordered from zomato chicken stuff is best chicken wings fried chicken chicken burger etc avoid stuff like rice bowls which are not that good place is okay can be slightly crowded at times,4,
yehh is good to have this kfc food and i like itand i want to eat it every time because i love it a lotttt soo friends go and eat itt and enjoy ittt,5,
"i do not knw d reason why everytime this particular branch of kfc declines my order however other branches who r far dan dis beanch accepts my order i do not blame kfc as a whole but this branch of gachibowli is just ridiculous if u want to decline the order den y do u evn take ordrs frm zomato ",1,
"never go for potato krisper burger  bad taste and these guys add imli chutney in it  its taste like what the hell we are eating
never go for this",1,
one piece missing,1,
dips were not delivered order incomplete,1,
quantity was too less,2,
well who does not love kfc i mean apart from their usual slips and mistakes kfc had always been a tasty treat i ordered the double zinger burger once and i loved it i am a big fan of the devil is wings the super charger was awesome too,4,
this is not up to kfc,1,
nothing bad nothing good just there service is just as expected hygienic as should be orders are taken good orders are completed in expected time good parking space just all good all good is not good can we have something more it is a little dull place to be this joint,3,
i have not received my pepsi can,3,
"ok i am not a big fan of kfc but i kinda really like the zinger 5 in one meal on the days when i really have no freaking clue what to have i straight away go to have this
go fill ur belly on these burgers",4,
local food is now tasting better than the branded ones,3,
"the experience was terrible snacker  longer tasted exactly the same coating was coming off of the fried chicken and see if you can find something fishy in the attached picture
hint 993 x 10  349",1,
"we have just now visited this kfc 

ordered triple treat

smokly grill is my favorite  service was delay because of saturday rush that is fine

maintenance is clean 

overall kfc is best and hope will visit again ",4,
cold food hot pepsi  bad combo,3,
smaller pieces this time,3,
ordered something and recieved something else,1,
usually they give it in a bucket this time it was jus in a paper box so the pieces were not good when we got it,3,
earlier i had bad experience with this restaurantquality was bad ambiance was terriblenow i see quality has improved but ambiance has not improved much not at all hygiene,3,
eagerly waited for food with kids only half order delivered spent rest of the time chasing the rest of the order,1,
both the zomato and kfc are cheating employees since order is placed on zomato app and delivered by kfc people none of them is willing to take responsibility even when the order is not delivered for two hours sad part is zomato is not refunding money which means customers are paying for not having their meals,1,
taken lot of time for delivery,3,
good as always,5,
took my friends brother for an early lunch meal on sunday restaurant was pretty empty and we had a pretty good meal service was fabulousthe kid spilled his drink and they offered another one,4,
burger quality has decreased,2,
great food worst attitude of staff members  especially mrajay rude and never accepted his fault of taking the order wrongly made me stand in queue and order again god knows how he got a 3 star badge,1,
there should be 4 pieces of hot n crispy but i got just 2 pieces which is injusticen i paid full price,2,
"one of the best chicken places ever the ambience is good a nice place to hang out with friends the staff are good too the menu is extensive and very delicious pocket friendly place for all the chicken lovers
my personal fav is the zinger box which has a chicken zinger hashbrown 2 pieces of chicken and coke worth 200bucks",5,
really slow delivery and hopeless responses when questioned about the same if the orders can not be served on time atleast inform customers ahead,1,
"kfc has to be good if not good its not kfc at all p
nobody cn resist those juicy chicken legs
i love the popcorn chicken and smoky grills",4,
"can not order for my address ever so i leo switching back to swiggy and ordering something else
green grace apartments khajaguda village adj to the oakridge international school is just not available to order",1,
good food,5,
ordered zinger burger through zomato at 2130 and it took two hours for delivery when i complained about delay they say restaurant is saying they have provided the perfect order,1,
"can not review it as the order and the delivery are not matching
disappointed ",1,
order was very fresh very yummy,5,
burger quality was not good,2,
food taste was very differentdid not feel that i was eating kfc chicken,1,
been there when me and my friend was so hungry after our shopping we ordered a smoky chicken rice bowl we awaited almost for 3540 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked did not felt it different coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good,4,
"worst ever kfc lunch i was a great fan of kfc and always liked to have it but now i have decided to not to eat kfc anymore chicken is more like rubber i was not able to eat it and thrown everything definitely they are using some medicines for fast growth of chicken
please do not order from kfc anymore",1,
the crispy stuff inside the burger was yuk,1,
excellent job,5,
the smoky grilled are the worst chicken i ever tasted i just throw away the chicken really very dissatisfied with kfc i will never again visit kfc,1,
"nice store outlet of kfc  came here for a quick snacks  the usual reason why we all go to kfc is 

i like zinger burger a lot  they now introduced a new krunchy zinger burger did not try it as yet
their choices of krushers is good  tried the blue flavoured one

overall its a good store to come with friends and have quality kfc food",4,

"kfc kentucky fried chicken  every one know this place then why to review i came here to have a quick meal and that to a new launch item krunchy burger as u can see lot of adds about this

the store is quite neat and clean might be the reason there r only two tables

staff is quite good nd cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice hash brown potato i did not liked it there was no taste actually for my palate coming to  burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it is crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it is soft

but over all its good want to give 35 buts u do not have option this box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent no heavy at all 209 for one box included taxes

keep going good guys see u again",4,
not properly fried,2,
so far the best kadhi chawal i have had in hyderabad veg thalis here are amazing and paneer lababdar is just finger licking you do not have to think twice to place an order from this place,4,
best north indian food in town the flavours were very well seasoned and we were very much satisfied with the reasonable pricing as well ordered naans and combos and it was given in fair quantity in relation to the prices would love to go again,5,
"one line review great food
there is just something about the taste that brings that delhite essence in the food
staff is also nice and thier playlist is great",5,
i have ordered lucknawi chicken pulaogood amount of chicken  delivered hotbut the food is so spicy that i was unable to enjoy the taste,3,
are you bored taking north indian foods from south indian restaurant then you must try the limited yet handcrafted north indian cuisines in norfest which is rapidly increasing its presence in the city i strongly recommend to all the city dwellers to stop by through this unique chain at affordable price with premium quality service must try makki di roti and sarson da saag i still feel those mellowing taste of this dish,5,
"norfest northern food feat

serves well to it is name the large menu catering to all needs of group and individual combos

great for deliveries order it at home or at work 

when looking for a yummmm north indian food reach out to norfest",4,
"review no 2 with delivery

ordered again mix veg this time  looked ok but tasted far better was dry for a curry but serving of veggies was plenty just for dryness reducing 1  i absolutely love this place  hope for better experience nect time

review 1
second time for this place but first time got it delivered had ordered paneer butter masala and mix veggreat quantity and qualitythis place is amazing for north indian foood i am glad zomato is now bringing it to vihanga area will be frequently ordering from here nothing to complain about best north indian food to order",4,
recently went there to eat paranthas it needs a lot of improvement earlier i had other non veg dishes on online order which were good ambience is good,3,
"i just loved it good food at reasonable price
paneer lababdar  daal makhni from this place is very good i also tried aloo kulcha and it was also good though the chole served with kulcha need to be improved",4,
"i have only tried vegetarian food as take away from here dal makhani is a must try  tried kadai paneer couple of timesit is subtle and flavorful
the malai kofta gravy is more on the sweeter side",4,
i ordered food herebut one guy called me nd said food is not available restaurant guy called me nd declined the order if food was not available you should not taken the order,1,
i ordered lucknowi veg galouti kebab and paratha through zomato but the quality of the kebab needs some serious improvement and were very oily too,1,
"ordered paneer makhani from norfest and i would mark it to be the finest paneer makhani that i have ever had the paneer was soft and the gravy was just so amazing the dish was made to meet utmost perfection and i recommend it as well ",5,
"in simple lines good thing comes in small packages  people who love a authentic north indian  desi type  this is the place to visit  remember this is a eat out in a shopping mall not a restaurant

price are reasonable they have kept there menu simple not like in restaurant having menu books where you struggle to order  i tried both veg and non veg  starters and main course   after having a bite i had to appreciate  it is good",5,
its my all time favourite mutton galuati kabab and paneer mirch wala are my favourite also one can taste shikanjijaljeera here which is awesome,5,
amritsari kulcha and chole is must try at this restaurant located in happening place yet economical option which provides value for money portion size is really good and recommended to carefully order to avoid wastage,5,
"well this is the first time i ordered from norfest  the dhaba i ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice dal makhani 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of rs 400 however very disappointed with the quantity of food at that price range they are not providing a proper portion  moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces 2 of them had bones and no meat  kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging  i gave three star only for the quality ",3,
i ordered punjabi chicken and my experience was horrible such a costly thing of rs 300 and such less quantity that hardly one person can eat the food too was not fresh and was stale and was smelling had to throw it away and neither zomato nor these ppl lsitened to any queries i wud suggest not to order from here as u can easily get at this price from good restaurants,1,
a really good meal at a reasonable price the quantity was perfect not a lot and not too less i ordered the paneer combo and shikanji  norfest dhaba has probably one of the best packaging materials looking at the box itself i started feeling more hungry the only part in the meal that disappointed me was the shikanji it was not something that you could brag about,4,
greeted warmly with experienced people explaining the various dishes available one of the best places in town if you are searching for some really tasty food loved the taste specially the butter chicken  will definitely recommend my friends,5,
"this is opened up in sln terminals and visitied during lunch time its a shop in a food court so no ambience as such
their paneer combo is a must try dal makhani was really good another thing we had was amritsari kulcha with chole  kulcha was good but chole can be made better overall a must go to place for the northside taste",4,
a must try place for north indian food lovers the kebab items are highly recommended the only problem is it is a part of a food court the items are decently priced and very tasty,4,
"finally someone can make food which i could call north indian amazing place to have a typical north indian types brunch or dinner only con i would prefer if they did had a proper place too

definitely visiting again",4,
"fake rating beware


we ordered galouti kabab and dhaba chicken both were pathetic and nowhere close to the name of the dish orange galouti kabab with yellow parathadhaba chicken is gravy tasted like toor daal",1,
food was very tasty but a bit costlyspecially their world famous kheer you should try starters were amazing you can try thali here so that you taste everything,4,
punjabi thali is awesome dal makhani mix veg and mushroom is recommended however cost can be reduced a bit in particular of the thalis,4,
last time i ordered mutton rogan josh from here it was amazing but today it was not fresh and only bones no meat it is sad my favourite restaurant is going down in quality,3,
"the place is located in the food court of sln terminus and the first branch of norfest in the city the seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole

as it was winter we were fortunate to have makki ki roti and sarson ka saag the makki ki roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan saag was good but lacked salt in it the flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it

the next thing was amritsari kulcha and chole a must try and must have at norfest the kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill the taste of the kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well the chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good

the final dish was the paneer lababdaar and garlic naan the curry again lacked salt and was not upto the mark in terms of taste so overall not recommended

vfm 45
taste 35",3,
good north indian food i ordered from them a couple of times have not visited the restaurant though so can not talk abt the experience the food is good,4,
giving satisfaction to hunger and brings in value for money cannot get tired of ordering food from the restaurant awesome fabulous feedthehunger,4,
ordered mix veg and tandoori rotis curry was tasty however i felt it had too much of beans overall a good experience i can order this again,3,
good taste and best place with special thalis complete punjabi taste with chaachh one of the good punjabi taste in hyderabad a must go at least once,4,
"i am shocked and i ever had in my life food taste like this in th any common food court of india it was my 2nd visit in 2 days m impressed by veg galaouti kabab what a flavour  smoothness textures binding combination of paratha  now i am a big fan of norfest it is simply located in food court no necessary and unessary interior simple and fresh love the food

we order something like jaljeera green  5
lassi salted 5
veg galaouti 5 6 10 100 i just love this
non veg galaouti 5
kheer 4 feel little thin
love the food keep it guys i wish you good luck

highly recommended for north food lover
chandni chauk bhool jaoge full copy of delhi high street
good job ",5,
"i hv been away from hyderabad from a year on coming back my brother told me about the dalnmakhni from this place he said it was amazing 
i ordered a couple of items along with dal makhni no doubt the dal makhni was nice but it can not be compared to d delhi dal makhni 

the menu is very crisp overall the food is really nice i would rate this place a 35 ",3,
"by far one of the best restaurant for north indian cuisine it is our go to outlet for ordering food the thalis are really fabulousboth veg and nonveg  the quantity is more than sufficient for one person and quality has been really consistent
they also offer lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well a typical awadhi pulaao overall a great restaurant to satisfy your north indian taste buds",5,
best place for authentic droolworthy north indian food reasonably priced and great ambience the dal makhani was definitely the best i have had in hyderabad,5,
"being a veggie it gets difficult to find good vegetarian food but every time i have food from this place its really good i wonder how they are able to maintain consistency both in terms of quality and quantity every single time

overall review best place for north indian food",5,
"place is good taste is also good but not the best kebabs were nice except the galawati kebab it was not as good as lucknow one the portions were quite small
service is fast",4,
"lunch at norfest gachibowli
i am a big fan of this place and love their combos
ordered their veg galouti kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney
was mast mast would have loved it to be a little more well done though

then came the veg combo  had 2 butter rotis with mixed veg curry corn carrot peas capsicum potato aloo onion mix   basmati rice and daal makhani
absolutely loved the mixed veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani  with very little daal but tasty nonetheless 

norfest is now operational in pvr galleria punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location 

their paratha combos are also a strong recommendation

"best butter chicken very nice service and staff is really friendly
will definitely visit again
highly recommended for the people who are looking for north indian food",5,

"i never been there for dinein but ordered many times the deluxe thali which was very good in quality as well as quantitylooking forward to go sometime there ",5,
"heavy punjabi food
a perfect place to savor typical dhaba style punjabi dishes 
a popular outlet for home delivery however place has common food court space available for dinein as well 
food was served hot and tastes yumm
chola masala  paneer was dominating the quantity of chola",3,
"suggested by one my best friend this place is on fire when it comes to taste north indian food 

what we ordered  amritsari kulcha with chole veg combo  paneer combo with a sweet lassi

must say the dishes were so damn yummy being in hyderabad i was missing good punjabi food and so was this place came to the rescue superb taste specially the paneer sabji  the amritsari buttery kulcha 

the food court is well ambient and had a great time

must visit if one misses north indian food",5,
was served very bad quality of chicken even for the second time they mixed kebab chicken in butter chicken and 2 to 3 varieties of chicken were mixed and chicken is half cooked and had a very bad smell,1,
after so much of appreciations was tempted for a punjabi thali and have ordered the same but the wait was not worth it dal was flavoured with colours and paneer was not at all delicious and soft wont recommend for a vegetarian punjabi thali,1,
"they definitely promise you a decent meal

known for their timely delivery and packaging norfest does not disappoint you

nonveg starter platter is more than enough for two people perfectly cooked two pieces of tangdi kebab malai kebab and angara kebab might not leave a lasting impression but in general they are well marinated and taste good

 punjabi non veg thali is perfectly packed meal box from salad to raita

 in a nonveg thali veg curries definitely need no mention but no one can ignore dal makhani wake up the dal makhani by stirring it as all the dal sunks to the bottom and sleeps felt it can be a bit thicker in consistency

butter chicken was so delicious and mild in spicies

butter rotis were hard and tough to tear  the usual packaging side effects

boondi raita definitely needs a mention for it is delicious texture and taste and so the rice kheer",3,
"what a place to eat we were more than overwhelmed looking at the quantity and awesome taste of authentic north india ordered rajma rice amritsari kulccha with chhole paneer daal makhni tandoori roti and each and every bit of it was scrumptious though we could not find our friend pratik there owner of the place we were well off enjoying our food rather than a chit chat d
thanks for such a great offering",5,
"ordered today veg thali via uber eats was reading reviews and expected it to be nice on the contrary it was a pathetic experience below item wise feedback
butter roti made full of maida and instead of butter it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis they should call it a naan actually
salad carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
paneer  it is so much stale and so hard to chew am sure it has exceeded it is expiry date
dal makhani  this was good and loved it the onlyitem in entire meal which i liked
mix vegetable  it is only beans with gravy which tastes awful
mix raita  while the curd part was good the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease

hope you take some action on this and not to cheat customers with the name of authentic punjabi with some nice reviews",1,
had the best dal makhani and butter chicken at this place in hyderabad located in sln terminus on 3rd floor not a big place but they serve amazing punjabi food at reasonable prices,5,
had been to this place for dinner we ordered fallout i kebab for starters that was quiet decentfor main course we ordered dal makhnibutter chickenpaneer lababdar and lacha parathadal makhni was good and even their butter chicken was tasty with lacha parathabut their lababdar was not authenticfinished with sweet lassi again was not that greatoverall good food,3,
food is the usp all i tasted there was great but my favourite is the punjabi butter chicken with bone such aroma n taste m salivating while writing even the only thing is i feel it is a little burn in the pocket,4,
food was delicious and the service of rakesh  rangadhar and chinmoy was very good after food they served us with pan with no additional cost that really delighted us,5,
"amazing food probably the best north indian food in hyderabad loved the rajma chawal kadi chawala and their dal makhani
saviour for north indians",5,
"after reading some good reviews went to this place by some search to reach this place ordered punjabi non veg spl thali and amruthsari kulcha with chole 
i wondered by looking the quantity of items they are very small quantity 
taste of the food is ok not as read in the reviews it is not great in non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy that is spl non veg thali great joke vfm 15  
they are not providing drinking water a eateryrestaurant should provide the drinking water
i have axis bank card with that they should give 15 disount when ordering they denied it after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste then they gave 10 discount after arguing they should give 15",1,
"this has been on my list for a while now but for some reason had not been able to make it there until recently went in for lunch with my colleagues was impressed by the level of activity at this place serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen housed in a food court

we ordered mutton galouti kebab veg seekh kebab paneer kadhai butter chicken dal tadka tandoori rotis and jeera rice the mutton kebab was delicious  the melt in the mouth and leave you wondering kind  only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty  strictly nitpicking

the veg seekh kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the mutton but still held a good taste the star for us was the butter chicken slightly tangy moderately spicy slightly sweet incredibly smooth and buttery with huge pieces of chicken i was bowled over so impressed was i that the paneer kadhai which was actually more than decent and very tasty failed to capture my attention the dal and the rotis were good but paled in comparison with the magic of that butter chicken the only less impressive dish among the lot was the jeera rice which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt  could have been better

in all a very good experience i cant say value for money but the food was impressive in general worth more visits any day thanks

"good food great service been coming here since years and the best thing is that it is always been stable with the food quality  service good place to hangout love it ",5,
great place awesome ambience and amazing north indian food the most goto place to satisfy your north indian taste buds 1010 value for money last but not the least quick and prompt service,5,
one of my favourite place to visit all the time i feel like home there best part of this place is self and easy going service which attracted me a lot my fav dish there butter milk gauloti kebab mutton rogan josh people are amazing there every one must try,5,
this place is awesome i ate a kulcha here it was awesome making me happy it was cheap and best i give 5 plus stars we ate for around 1200 but we did not get to know that it was so cheap,5,
"best punjabi food i have come across in hyderabad so far
called for non veg kebab combo 

kebab pieces  proper leg pieces of chicken marinated in juices of masala served with coriander chutney is damn good

garlic naan  garlic and stretchy soft naans was pretty good

dal makhani  had such a good dal makhani  creamy and flavoursome it made my day",5,
"would you like to feast on north indian food in hyderabad are you a foodie or die hard fan of butter chicken go or order from norfest i was deffinitely vow after having sambhar or idli for couple of days when i ordered from this place big fan of them tried their all outlet and i must say good pricing with awesome taste without curry leaves  in hyderabad no offence to south indian  food
best part is that it will not hurt your wallet badly if you compare with dhaba etd 1956 or other so called north indian restaurant",5,
"ordered the punjabi thali for lunch it was amazing the quantity is perfect and the food was really delicious
the thali had 2 rotis paneer butter masala dal makhani mix veg mint chutney raita steamed rice salad and a dessert
the packing was really good and the rate is pocket friendly
a must try",4,
"description of this place says authentic punjabi food and their food corroborates this very well we ordered their north indian special thali a few days back 
the packaging was good and spillproof and looked appetizing 
it had 2 vegetable dishes one paneer and one dal along with zeera rice and 2 butter naan and green mint chutney and a sweet dessert to end the meal with the quantity was more than sufficient for one person  each item was very tasty and kheer as dessert was the best of all 
it was decently priced and if combined with any offer of zomato its just great deal

packaging  55

overall a very good experience",4,
that taste of mutton galouti kabab oh my god soo yum it just melt down in you mouth i just loved and recommend others to try it with lassi  so happy we could get at least this dish in hyderabad,5,
located on top floor of sln terminus  in one of the food court is corner norfest dhaba has well arranged menu and delivery to table unlike other stalls there ambience was good went on a weekday very less crowded ordered special veg dum pulao rice was well cooked did not find lot of veggies though masala levels were good that adds spicyness can give it a try for 180 bucks,3,
i ordered food online but i wish i went there so that i could have had more dishes the food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money i had lucknow chicken dum pulao boneless and it made my day quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you will end up having a full tummy hyderabadi briyani is famous but i found this on equal par with it,5,
"have been to this place and also ordered from here this place serves one of the best awadhi and punjabi dishes in hyderabad this is located in the food court of sln terminus mall loved their butter chicken which went really well with tandoori roti galouti kebab was awesome as well and went really well with the paratha served

ordered lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as chicken today portion size for both was a little on the lower side the flavors and taste were awesome as soon as the food was in the house we could smell awadhi cooking they serve boondi raita with the pulao this is a welcome break from the onion  tomato raita that usually comes with biryani

" this has to be my favourite punjabi restaurant in hyderabad during my short trip in hyderabadi have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer what i liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price
the taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full
i visited this place with my friend without any proper planning our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub we wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy 
so we ended up in this restaurant it is located at the food court and has open seating facility


we ordered the punjabi special vegthali
269
it was the most delicious thali i ever had in life just divine and out of the world 
it comprises of the following
kadai paneer 455
paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste i have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy but this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy

dum aloo 45
this was the veg of the day potatoes  were peeled properly and were marinated nicely just like paneer the gravy was something to lure for

dal makhani 455
a punjabi thali is definitely incomplete without a dal makhani it is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country the dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans it was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani i ever had

bundi raita 55
this one stole my heart  i think words will not do justice for its great taste i never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me i eat out a lot i would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy the curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour a big thumbs up for this dish 

rice 45
the zeera basmati rice  was definitely of the best quality it was big in size and was cooked so well each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own 

butter tandoori roti 45
it was soft buttery and definitely only made up of wheat  without any hint of maida

salad 455
fresh cucumber  carrot  and onion with a pinch of lemon  is definitely makes the best salad in a punjabi thali 

kheer 45
the perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer it was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone


 the service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins what i like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy
the quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it but i will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty you will regret sharing even a single bite
surely try this outlet and you will thank me later 


final verdict 
food  5

overall rating ",4,
"okay to begin with a 43 rated place in food court sounded quite fishy to me so i was expecting a big bang surprise with their food i had amritsari kulcha with chole sweet lassi and shikanji
first coming to the people who spoke about authentic punjabi food in reviews guys you are either out of your mind or really need to hit punjab and eat there
shikanji was plain flavoured water that tasted medicinal lassi was the worst one i have had lately the amritsari kulcha and chole was tasteless the dollop of butter didnt taste as it was meant to
overall a very disappointing experience",2,
a must visit for great north indian food relish on the veg n non veg starter platter much delicious dal makhni n paneer curries n value for money is cherry on the cake totally recommended,5,
awesome north indian punjabi food served here at reasonable price,5,
authentic punjabi khana in the gachibowli area their rajma chawal  dhaba chicken and thalis are very good their pudina paratha and amritsari kulcha are very yummy dal makhani is very heavy the kheer is a must try in the deserts the seating is limited as it is in food court but service is fast even home delivery packing is very good,4,
"i never been to this place but recently ordered veg combo  punjabi nonveg combo and curries
dal makhani is mouth watering and other items included in combos are also yum",4,
"veg pulav kadai paneer garlic naan
pulav is not properly cooked looks colorful but tasteless the gravy is too sweet naan i could see the uncooked dough",3,
this is delhinorth india for me on a platter good paranthas awesome rajmachawal and butter chicken definitely a must trylove this place,4,
"have been there several times and have opted for delivery too

they serve pretty good authentic north indian food mutton rogan josh butter chicken and dal makhni are top notch very flavorful and authentic

galaouti kebabs are by far the best item in the menu

story goes that one particular nawab of lucknow who was an infamous couch potato had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab so galaoutis were invented

and the mutton galaouti is served here are exactly like mentioned above very soft not much chewing required they just melt in the mouth they are served with ulta tawa paratha is and is a must must try

pricing is very economical and occasionally they offer 50 discount too over uber eatsso if u have a thing for north indian cuisine it is a nice place to go",4,
"loved the service although their other outlet in madhapur has more seating available this place is going to be worth when you visit in a group of 45 people ",3,
"one of my favs for north india food in hyderabad and within budget the veg galauti kababs amritsari kulcha with chole adds to the punjabi food a nice small outlet in sln terminus food court run by punjabis and hence the punjabi taste in the food is what makes my inner punjabi come out and relish the cusine at this place

guys open more outlets in hyderabad its would be a great success

cheers rakshita nath",4,
"amazing food anyone who wants to have delicious finger licking punjabi food must visit

at this place they are like an outlet rather than a restaurant so it might feel a bit uncomfortable but there food will make you forget all complaints",4,
"i strongly recommend punjabi butter chicken bone or boneless with naan any typethis is the only item i order herewhich is deliciously tasty

tried veg dum pulao and lassi also nopei can not even rate these items they should remove these items from there menu

for me this dhaba is brand ambassador for punjabi butter chicken ",4,
"been here to this place many a times till now and it has never disappointed i have also ordered food online from here many times whenever i am hungry and i want to eat good punjabi food this has been my goto place in gachibowli recently a second outlet was opened in madhapur also
i have tasted almost every item here like paneer butter masala matar mushroom dal makhni amritsari kulcha with chole lucknowi chicken dum pulav murgh tikka masala punjabi special veg  nonveg thali rajma chawal etc
my best picks are matar mushroom paneer butter masala punjabi special veg thali punjabi butter chicken to name a few
i was disappointed with the rajma chawal though

the best thing about this place is its consistency in taste which it maintains
overall it was a great experience and i would rate this as 455 for its food",5,
"best food spot located in sln terminus the food quality is great although some dishes were bit sweeter than i expected 
have ordered multiple times both online and being there i will totally recommend dal makhani and rajma from this place lassi is 3 as well

"food is worth the hype expect a crowd

i ordered a chicken dum pulao and it was the best thing i ate in my 6 days stay at hyderabad everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious though a little expensive they were worth it there were ample pieces of chicken
only things i would complain about would be pudina chutney and the quantity of rice

this is located on the 3rd floor of a mall sln terminus and you will have to dine in the common food court good food and the close proximity to it companies attract a crowd you can order online to avoid the rush",5,
"awesome dilli ki yaad aa gayi food

there chole kulche is love and even the other dishes it is a good option to even home deliver as the seating is not great",5,
the best north indian food available in hyderabad specially dal makhani and the mouthwatering galhouti kabab they are to die for it is a must must try when you are in hyderabad and craving for good north indian food,5,
the best place for having authentic north indian food amritsari kulcha with chole butter naan with dal makhaniyou will not find it better than here the galouti kebabs were too yummy and had the typical melt in mouth functionality,5,
"had the panneer of the day combo here it was matar pannerdal makhani needless to say one of the best cooked dal makhani and matar paneer i ever tasted it was a bit pricey but the taste was totally worth it norfest has set a new bench mark for how dal makhani and panneer dishes are to be made

the only thing i can complain about is the quantity for 240 i felt that what i had on my plate was really less",4,
"this place is part of the food court in sln terminus they maintain proper hygiene and service is also good

coming to the food we ordered paneer combo in which they serve paneer curry rice dal makhni and 2 roti quantity is sufficient for 1 person the best part of the meal was their dal makhni it was just wow paneer curry was good in taste but it had little strong flavour of tadka

i also had amritsari kulcha with chole it was good in taste also tried their lassi and sikanji lassi was delicious but sikanji was totally opposite it was not refreshing as it should be

overall we had nice experience and recommendable place to have food in sln terminus

follow me on instagram on veganyums for more food fun",4,
"must visit place

cheers with avin seth",4,
"this review is for online order

ordered punjabi spcl veg thali  rajma chawal through uber eats received generous 50 off

packaging of thali was very good which did not cause any spillage or mixing of curries

all the items were good in taste having medium spices kheer was the highlight of thali having perfect sweetness and flavors of saffron was amazing

rajma chawal was also great",4,
i love this place and keep coming back here problem is i am pregnant and i get norfest food pangs and for whatever reason you guys have stopped taking home delivery orders i live at lanco hills manikonda and the food delivery does not deliver here as a request from a pregnant lady who loves your food especially the dal makhani can this be looked into,5,
best place to get great food i have been there more than 60 times in last two year but still in love would recommend dal makhani  awesome tastemust try,5,
"the food was a treat to my taste buds just amazing food ordered
achari paneer tikka
chole kulche
galowti kabab
shikanji

must visit for every north india in hyd",5,
"absolutely yummy foodhave been visiting this place for quite a sometime now and just love it
dal makhni is a proper north indian one and made me a big fanservice is top notchalways a good place to grab a bite of after tiring shopping at spar",5,
"well  what should i say i mean i have been dying for authentic north indian food for so long and here i am enjoying the flavors of north  thank you guys for your wonderful food and lassi ",5,
"one of the best place to have punjabi food we ordered
dal makhni it is the best dal makhni i had in hyderabad with a proper punjabi flavour
dal tadka loved it not very oily and perfect taste
garlic naan good",4,
"it is serves one of the best punjabi food in hyderabad the galouti kabab will melt in your mouth as soon as you will eat it
the deserts are not good though but still it will remind you of northe indian taste",4,
"the spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal including me set about while writing a review scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had
on such a rare occasion i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this
since the time i shifted to hyderabad i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant
spicy hot and tangy became a common thing and here comes norfest like a strong and quiet gallant hero who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon

the mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where street food sellers scream in the humid heat ushering people to come in to their food haven it was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again the nuts on top were a nice touch

we also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and i a slow eater finished it in seconds i still remember the taste in my mouth tandoori chicken soft and creamy gravy with warm rice
the dal makhani i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added
i a pure non vegetarian became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums carrots and corn the gravy enveloping it was amazing
the thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it
the kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip
it was sweet the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch
talking about it i am definitely reordering it tomorrow kudos",5,
bit pricy as compared to the location tasty authentic north indian food amritsari kulcha chole must try little spicy but north indian food would go that way friendly staff served on table limited menu items,4,
terrible chicken masala curry had only 1 piece which was about one inch square on the bone extremely hotcant taste any major spiced except loaded red chilly gave me gas for a good 30 mins,1,
nicely delivered,5,
i did not get any gravey item sherva how can we eat without gravey do not you have sense to send without sherva along without biryani,1,
i received hens hair in chicken haleem also i ordered chicken 65 biryani but received veg biryani what kind of customer service is that,1,

if anyone wants to order from this restaurant think before you order the food they will give the biryani rice from chicken biryani even if you order for a veg biryani and the butter naan will be like a chewing gum u have to chew it for a long time to swallow it,1,
"i am wondering how this restaurant has a 35 rating

it was great experience  you will find crowd mostly on friday and saturday dance floor is not that great pricing was normal you can enjoy with family too,4,
place is awesome so their craft beers liked belgian wit and belgian strong ale both are amazing food taste and quality is good they must improve a bit on quantity after all they are charging good price for food lot to improve in service they are not vigilant about customer needs no cutlery was kept on the table until repeatedly asked for it overall it is a good experience,4,
"i came there with my friend as stags it was written stags are allowed till 8 pm but the reception person was unkind to say you are not allowed  at 745 he was looking down on us just cause there was no girl the other point that he raised was that my friend was not wearing shoes it looked reasonable
overall it felt humiliating and i felt it was not a decent place to even receive you",1,
most terrible place i used to love chennai 10d and with that brand i went to hyd 10d firstly they took cover charge for a couple and they had no seats could have told us we have no seats we would not have paid cover charge we stood for good 20 mins and then given bad seats near the speaker where one could not even talk and then the waiters werent serving us food properly had to ask them twice after whicj they took order and when they did they did not give us cutlery can you even imagine i had to ask that give forks  i had the worst experience ever of going to a place extremely disappointed please learn how to manage a crowd also i wanted to book my table beforehand but the option was not even available on zomato and they will not pick up call it just felt they did not want things to be systematic extremely disappointed,1,
reading the reviews we visited this place however our experience was not good we were not offered our preferred seat even when most of the tables were empty and unreserved few of the staff members were rude and rigid and the food was fine,1,

"an uber cool place with an ambience which reminds you of any pub in london well is not the name making it obvious been here couple of times place outside on terrace gets filled up faster than insidethey now have water sprays outside to keep you cool in summers

this is a brewery but again not all beers in the menu are available most of the time although the home beer is good must try

food is okay can be better

"good food good ambience at less price what else needed
10d has two outlets one in gachibowli sln terminal mall 10th floor and the other one in begumpet the best thing about this place as i mentioned you will have awsm food at very less pricewhat i ordered was chicken lasagna with garlic bread and mexican chicken quesadillas both were yummm and they came with a drink of your choice which can be beer wine cocktail soft drink dessert 
so you get food with drink combo for my two orders mentioned above it cost me 280 each which is amazing",4,
"this place is sooo good in everything food ambiancedrinks and what not but the main problem is again i am a stag for most of the times so couldnt enter majority of the evenings  else it would have been 5 star
totally worth the visit",4,
i order mexican veg salad what dressing giving i do not no but this is not good very bad proper dressing is olive oil  mustard sauce but giving me tomoto sauce dressing services is good bikash shoo you gave good beer was a very good beer thanks for bikash but ambience is good,5,
"this is a good place to hang outthe ambience is really good  one of the best chicken nachos i have had till date but the crispy chicken disappointed they do not have a big list of beers being brewed and the is not that great when compared with other brews in hyderabad
would recommend this place if you are someone who likes virgin pinnocolada",3,
"located on the 10th floor of snl mall  this place is one of the most hip party places in gachibowli
the ambience is good and the place is huge as well
food is also good and service is again awesome
good place to have a group events ",4,
it is wonderful and lively place on 10th flooroutdoor seating is beautiful we ordered chicken lasagna fish  chips chicken lollipops veg schezwan noodles chilli garlic baby corn and schezwan egg fried rice every dish was really good but the schezwan egg fried rice could have been better mocktails are no doubt the bestmust visit place,4,
great ambience and food but cocktails could have been better i had pasta with white sauce and it was best i had in quite sometime however i was disappointed with cocktail i ordered liit but it was not as good as i expected but overall it was a good visit and i will probably try something else next time,3,
summer chills are here at ten d we get to know that when you try the new brew summer blonde ale highly recommend beer dont miss it cheers beautiful ambience,5,
it is in the other side of the sln terminus  out door seating is great  ambeince is good  but you feel bored sitting inside  food was good  ladies night on thursday  worth the visit,4,

ambience is good but quality of food not up to the mark good place with family and friends wth music and all most pathetic cocktail i ever had,2,
"10downingstreet is known for it is wonderful ambience their inhouse brew is awesome
one of my all time favourites is the mushroom added shepherd is pie
if you want to chill with your gang on a cool sunday evening the outdoor rooftop bar will be the place
they also have a cozy dance floor space",4,
"it is a wonderful and lively place on the 10th floor we were sitting outside which was even more beautiful there is even a dance floor near inside sitting area
the food we ordered was chicken lasagna and veg lasagna pink pasta and spicy chicken rice of which all were good the food we ordered was served quickly
in weekdays the place is lightly crowded which makes it a nice place for dates or for hangouts",5,
"vegetarian review 

this is my go to place when i randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer i do not remember how many times i have been here on the 10th floor the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated though i personally like outdoors the dance floor is a little small but hey the dj has to be good right

with their whole ranged of brewed beers  4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide i like ale above all we combined it with honey chilli potato dahi ke kababs baby corn tempura
honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish
dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney
lasagne is good and pasta is so so and i did not like it that much food is average here but a glass of beer and one will not mind wines are not that great too so go for beer 

the staff is good and friendly the price is a bit on expensive side i would say there are minimal cover charges for the pub the embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it is fun

the dj is amazing and i always had great time shaking my leg on the floor so it is a must go if u still have not been here ",4,
i am not a huge fan of buffet but i have been here only to taste the dishes and they were great and had a variety this place is for family get togethers you will enjoy the food by its taste and variety and you get food chocked love at the live counters i have been here a long time ago but i still remember my time here i am giving this only three stars only coz i am not a fan of buffet,3,
great ambience and decent brew beer but there is something very elegant in terms of ambience but food is on little disappointing we order chicken starter and french fry is both where disappointing in terms of chicken starter i felt high ajino moto,3,
the place is decent and not heavily crowded the ambience and staff courteousness is good but the food has a bit of room for improvement in terms of taste the mocktails and onion rings were good however the dumplings are very poor in taste that we had to send them back,4,
had been there for friend is birthday partyit was on saturdaysuch an amazing place we have ordered mocktailsveg and non veg starters some alcoholtasty food fine ambeince but very far from my placedance floor was so goodgo with your frnds and have fun,4,
highly recommended place for all the party lovers i have been to few roof top lounge bars but this is the best 10th floor  city view cool breeze and a drinkwhat else can one ask for  5ratings for the food and the prompt service,5,
food is average service is poor can get crowded the ambience especially interior and its seating could have been better though finger food is good not much options for main course,3,
"been here through the years
it is been so homely and great
i would be happy to come every week if possible
the prices are decent
food is great
alcohol is great
music is not my kind though
great going team",4,
definitely one of the worst places to go for foodif you order pasta oligo e olio you get veggie noodles yes not even spaghetti and the server tries to convince you that is it is what the dish is meant to beand you order chicken steakyou get a stale lump of so something covered in a sauce that is possibly cooked and stored for days dangerous to go there,1,
it is a very happening pub in the town tds  we call it it is so true that the environment will not let you be lazy or be out of sync service is so prompt also the staff is well trained the dj is just 1010 ambiance is super cool must visit place for the all party lovers also this is value for money,5,
"this place has treated me with great warmth every time i have stepped in as soon as you enter the pleasant attitude of the staff is something that overwhelms me the doorman mr gaikwad pinkky has always been there to answer all questions all the waiters have been cordial and pleasant with me to mention a few names venkat pradeep pradhan mahesh and all the others whose names i do not remember special thanks to john blessie for his warm hugs and welcoming smile makes every visit memorable sudhakar you re great a man of sheer intelligence and ideas

5 stars for such a great experience  1 more star for all the happy moments you all have shared with me

keep up the good work  keep those smiles on our faces kudos to the staff",5,
"absolutely loved the place it is has a nice classic touch compared to the 10d in begumpet which has become too crowded and lost it is charm
you would change your opinion about 10d if you visit this place in gachibowli
rooftop open air ambience with comfy seating
service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it is jam packed on a friday night they also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business away from the music the entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look
staff are courteous and know their menu well do ask them for suggestions if you are confused on which ones to choose
it is got a separate dance floor and bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome they play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love
overall it is one of the best i have visited in a long time will definitely be on my frequent visit list
tip  do try their inhouse beers there are 4 varieties of them you can get a sample tray of all flavours so that you can taste each type and choose whichever you like",4,
"this place is lively
the ambience is good
there is open terrace too
the staff is real friendly
the food is good
the dj did not feel up to the mark though",4,
i had pub lunch at this place yesterday with my family we ordered beer one moctkail and one cocktail for drinks and corn and spinach lasagne non veg lasagne and fish and chips food was ok ambience and service was upto the mark as always,4,
"it is that kind of place which wouldnt cost you an arm and a leg when you eat to your hearts and ofcourse stomach is too p content
food is exceptionally amazing to all the nonveg loverschicken lasagna is bae
the rooftop ambience is amazing especially in the evenings the indoor seating is decent 
45 because the staff are not courteous and they dont respond quickly and we had to call them multiple times to just take the order",4,
"vegetarian review heard a lot about this place and it did not disappoint me the only thing that bothered me was the loud music  i am not talking about the dance floor  it was so loud that we had to scream to be audible the dance floor was also decent food was amazing i did not expect such good food at this place
note i heard that they are charging rs 80 per mineral water bottle
must try butter paneer masala with naan
ambience 355
value for money 45
service 35",4,
"to spend a nice evening after office hours we visited this place and occupied a table in the open area of it

the weather was nice and thus we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it

in drinks we had hot toddy brewed beer fruit punch pinnacolada and many other mocktails all of these were good but there was nothing special about them

in food we had masala omelette loaded nachos cottage cheese fingers mushroom tikka fish and chicken wings

loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them

overall the place is nice but the food and drinks were okayish in comparison to the other places in town",3,
"entering in to it from parking is something like finding a treasure hunt 
besides nice place to hangout ambiance is great and view from it is nice",4,
this place is in the sln terminus mallgood location with young it crowd of hitec city pouring innice varieties of beerhuge place nice setting and ambienceonly the dance floor seems congested since it is smalloverall a nice place with delicious food,5,
"i had gone for lunch a few days back and no doubt the place and food is amazing but i was not given the dessert which was included in the platter and the staff is always looking at you while you are eating until you finish
2 stars for food and ambience respectively but for the service they provide i am not at all happy with the place",2,
a great place for beer lovers their brews are just amazing specially the herb and citrus one it is a perfect place for a saturday night fun with the tandoori starters and the finger foods being just awesome worth it,4,
"well another brew in town 2nd 10 d in the town  the one at begumpet the oldest and class apart from the old rest of the class remains same being a brewery s an additional advantage with this place i loved all of them they have outdoor seating which will amazing in the evenings but you guys need prior reservation for sure ",4,
"we went here for lunch on a girls day out and were amazed with the classy ambiance and decor

first thing that made us happy was the interiors and the way the place was done

we tried veg platter for starters which was delicious the quantities was just right for two people

we enjoyed some mocktails alongside and a bowl of corns

the place is a bit expensive but i think it is worth it as we loved the food and the ambiance

we certainly would love to revisit it on a date night and enjoy the rooftop experience at the time we went the rooftop was closed as some renovations were going on

highly recommended",4,
great lively place to hang out with friends music here is great dj surely knows his music service is top notch too food wise starters were yummy has paneer kadhai and roti found it to be spicy but tasty the outdoor space offers great views of the city overall a o brainer when it comes to having good times with friends,4,
"one place i can visit over and over just for ambiance
lasagne is a must try here
one thing to keep in mind they will take the last order 5 mins before it closes and wont give time to eat will just close the lights and ask u to leave",3,
went with collegues for lunchgood food but not so great ambience staff is not pleasing at all there were only bothered about taking plates off the table,3,
"being close to my house sln terminus is one place i have often visited be it serifina  that got closed or the lal street or mystery rooms or 10d  it is a happening place and worth a visit

have been to 10d quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 45 star i would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting

we visited once over a weekend once during the christmas time and once when there was a ladies night the best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes

ambiance  the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections my favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then

service  if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it is crowded  and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times the staff is courteous and quick to attend

food  definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time food is ok and will not disappoint u

drinks  there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and liit is worth giving a try

overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
friday night or sunday night is what i would recommend and yes the more the merrier you are definitely going to enjoy if it is a group

overall 35

"if you are in hyderabad and its weekend this place is a must visit place awesome crowd ambience is good overall a perfect weekend hangout place whether you hangout with friends or as a couple

"good place to hang out with family and friends i tried couple of cocktails and shots cocktails were not strong at all so it was more of plain juice i would recommend that in the cocktails menu the should also mention in details what is the base and also the content of alcohol

starters were great i ordered chinese platter and i was really nice
music was loud and lively",4,
this was an amazing place  you can go there with friends and partner  awesome ambience and also provides indoor and outdoor sitting area the food was delicious we ordered garden fresh pizza and cheese kurkure fingers  both were amazing  a must go place,5,
"my friend and i visited this place on the 13th of january around 1920 hrs and ordered your strong ale we believe that the beer was coughed into and we both fell severly sick with a scratchy throat and dry cough i dont know why dont your employees wear a mask when on duty because i do not think i will ever return to you guys and this was my second trip to you and the second trip made me fall sick i will spread it like wild fire for others before they fall sick i can understand only one person falling sick but both falling sick with the same symptoms after consuming the strong ale beer then there is something definiately wrong and i am certain that the beer we were served was unhygienic or was contaminated beacsue on my visit on the 8th of jan i never fell sick with the strong ale it was on the 13th that my friend and i fell sick  second ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes your staff would stand on my head to make sure i am not smoking pot and are you serious i use fresh tobacco like american spirit and roll my cigarettes and never expected this kind of survelance upon rolling a cigarette and taking my loose tobacco original pouch packing to smell that it is not pot i feel humilated train your staff on hygiene and educate them


ps my first visit was on the 8th jan and just fyi across the globe beer sampling is not chargable hence they are called samples",1,
we had an evening office party here and that too on a friday the atmosphere was lively and the terrace view was sublime the food tasted good though people will not visit the place for the same a bit heavy on the pricing side but it was worth it,4,
went there on a friday we were only stags but we went there early at about 6pm the environment was very energetic we had great conversations until night and then went to the dance floor the dj was amazing a good mix of english and hindi songs had one of my best night outs here it was a little on the expensive side though for 3 people the bill was 9k rs,5,
vibrant ambience with a loud music enjoy the dancefloor beer is good service is very attentive food could be better bollywood night was happening,4,
superb place cool place to hangout having both terrace seating and indoor seating separate room for dance floor makes this place unique  great ambience  brewed beer was also good decent and limited crowd table booking is highly recommended,4,
10d is one of the best places to hangout witj friends and families great ambience with awesome views food and staff behaviour is very kind,4,
"an amazing place for partying and that much needed respite after a tiring day of work
10downing is the brand well known across the breadth and width of the country offers exciting pub lunches and some awesome parties
this 10d is unique in it is own ways and has a brewery unit attached to it so it is a bonus in terms of the variety on offer for the alcoholics
have been to this place on a few occasions once to taste the brews and another visit was for a pub lunch which comes with a glass of draught beer
my suggestions chicken lasagne shepard is pieroast lamb and a lot more
must admit the pub lunch here is one of the best and the brews are brilliant to pair with some food
overall it is a gem of a place with amazing viewsgreat food choices and a decent collection of drinks to offer you a complete package",5,
it is a good place but the one in begumpet is a even better the food is good the music calms you on a bad day  if you have the option to the the begumpet onethen go for it,4,
"ask me about good food and i will tell you about 10d known for it is best taste and quality food i have been a regular customer here ever since i moved to hyderabad and so will i be

if you have never been here go right away

must have lasagne 10d serves one of the best lasagne ever jeera rice and mutton rogan josh chicken tikka chicken nachos and spaghetti bolognese

cons wine options are bad that is the only thing i actually regret but if you love beer you will get lucky",5,
we happened to visit this place with office frenz and trust me the rooftop was awesomethe staff was courteous and everything was well managedwe had loads of fun and the food was tasty i keep visiting this place and always will,4,
"a very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset 

i have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations
the ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that it has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live
coming to food and service i would rate it 15 we tried the jalapeo cheese poppers horrible taste so much so we had to leave some of it we had the vegetarian pizza served burnt at the base on asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark the service was literally horrible being a sunday everyone was just chilling on their own i guess 

i would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place",3,
"while the food is pretty similar and standard to their begumpet outlet the ambience is worthy of a mention here
the service is definitely better

do up your game with some of the dishes though",4,
the ambience along with the roof top view was amazing the brewery was nice and was like the other breweries in town the thin crust pizza could have been better overall a nice place to chill out with friends,5,
"a grand entry decent ambience and average food that just about sums it up for 10 downing street
just as the name suggests the place has a very british feel to it as far as the ambience goes it is cost warm and has great layout but the layout proves to be a negative as well we went here for lunch and the place was very loud the good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view the service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive i hope they write down what was ordered
the food itself was good we had chicken wings chicken tikka seekh kabab tandoori veg platter and drinks the food was good and arrived a tad slow overall it is a good place to have a drink and be merry",3,
"great place and a really amazing crowd the ambiance service and food are altogether great
there is a variety in terms of permutations of drinks that this place has to offer
a must visit place for a funfilled weekend",4,
very rude staff ask them for corporate discount and they will ask you to cancel your reservation such a pathetic thing to say to any customer,1,
a beautiful place with lots of options available at our bay we went in happy hours and the food was really great with good service and drinks also were apt to go with the food overall a great place to hang out,4,
meh straight up heard from a friend that this is apparently rated the best pub in hyderabad but living in bangalore for 25 years and boston for 5 this place is way over priced to start food is good do not get me wrong but this place is clearly taking your money for the service and ambience which is so genuinely meh for example asked for a bottle of water which apparently takes about 20 mins,2,
"best sunday evening of gachibowli hydrabad dj rocks awoesom bollywood mashups live music was also very very good i came with my coulege for celebration after our project launch party was full tired but good quality sound selection of songs mature and professional staff change our constraints restart our engine

"the only positive thing of the place was the ambience and atmosphere we ordered nachos which was not served with salsa sauce  the mocktails were good enough but the barbequed paneer tikka was just horrible it tasted like it was stale and was loaded with a lot of spice ",2,
"ooo the 10d
again brewed beers lovely food good musiccan be better
very nice ambience rooftop setup is oh so lovely

a bit heavy on pockets service is good until the clock ticks 11 i felt the staff were a bit too in a hurry to get everything closed down and to get lights off which is a turn off so folks  get your beers by 1055 ",3,
a good place to relieve all your tension after your work good food good ambience and good crowd can not resist myself to be there again,5,
hi guys i visited 10 downing last night after long rescrech about the bar and food so my experience on the roof top bar along with cool breezes septamas food ambiguity and cocktails we ordered long llt     taste was good,4,
"we had a pub lunch at 10d street gachibowli
we had great time we were grp of 20 members a perfect sitting arrangement for all 20 members was done by miss pinky
we all had good time with good food and ambience",5,
we have visited this place multiple times for lunch it had now become our go to restaurant for casual team lunches the pub lunch menu has quite a few options to choose from and all the items are pretty good you also get a glass of her or wine or a mojito to choose from the moon drinkers also have an option to go for a soup or chose a cold drink with the food the best part is the food and the service has been consistently good,4,
"compared to headquarters in somajiguda this place is 1000 times better equal respect to each and every individual not like headquarters giving respect to rich and wealthy people

ambience is super and just a note they should focus on their food quality and quantity

overall this place is superb",5,
"this outlet located on 10th floor of sln terminus is our team dinner venuerlrestaurant had a decent ambience but open top can have some more mild lighting brewery is available but as we booked a buffet in bulk  we got limited options for food and alcohol

food has got 2 veg plus 4 non veg appetisers
main course was very limited biryani is and gravy each one for veg and non veg tandoori rotis and nans desserts were very limited vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun

alcohol has 4 options bacardi white rum antiquity whisky smirnoff vodka and kf beer
mocktails cool drinkssoda and fruit juice available for mixing loud music with divine drinks on breezy roof top is definitely worth a try",3,
"this is my go to place for comfort lunches within a budget you will simply have to love their cracking rice and chicken lasagne cause they are to die for
i love how they always give a drink with this set menu
the red shredded chicken and crackling rice along with their lasagne were a perfect match for each other
i have also had the chicken nachos which were alright but their lunch menu is a must try",4,
great cool place had visited it when i was in hyderabad with my mate this place has great food and even better brewed beer a must try if you are in the area,5,

one of the best restaurants i have visited in hyderabad i like to spend time here whenever i feel like going the ambience is just awesome food is also good but little costly drinks are no doubt the best specially sangria is awesome,5,
"around 11 of us went to this place to have lunch located a great place in gachibowli
the ambience of the place is great and so was the hospitality
coming to food ordered two non veg platters all the items in the platter were great but when the quantity is compared to the costits little disappointing but they entirely make it up with their taste and quality beers were good but they not at all strong we can drink it like cold water
the main course was spread across continental chinese and indian from continental side we ordered pasta lasagne and a fish again the quantity was less but quality was great from chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawnsin indian we ordered peshawari chicken nawabi chicken punjabi chicken all these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts

the main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch best enjoyed when visited with max 34 ppl

food is just average but the ambiance and the quality of service is amazing i love their chicken lasagna and stroganoff chicken nachos and 10d special chicken pizza are the dishes i almost always order their beers are good,4,
ambience is absolutely fantastic it feels like a much more expensive place than it is their pub lunch menu is a great idea what you get is more than worth the money you pay i had bolognese spaghetti with red wine it was not the best one i have had but still tasted great,4,
i have always loved the tds chain been to kolkata bhopal and hyderabad but hyderabad has been the worst experience eververy bad service we had to wait for long hours for the food to be served no one was bothered even about the bill,2,
really good place in gachibowli ambience is average but good place with good vibes and crowd they have their own brewed beer with taster pack available open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area they have a dance floor there are karaoke nights as well on weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees entry is from side in the building sln terminus lunch menus are bad food is just average here most of the gravies taste same and brown in color overall worth a visit good place to enjoy music and have fun,4,
did not like the ambience also what is the point of giving drinks in plastic cups to girls do you want to make them feel bad that they are getting free drinks overall not a very good experience,3,
i dont know what kind of pub is this u people dont allow stag on weekends and u people allow on weekdays bill tho stag hi pay kartha reey bhai yehi city meey highlife lal steet repete clubn playboy prost koi bhi tum logoke jaisa behave nahi kartheey better come out from that illusion,1,

"i have been to quite a few similar places in hyderabad and after a lot of hype about this place finally on the monday night we visited this place for a team dinner and needless to say that it was a really enthralling experience
starting from the reception area  especially that guy with a moustache you made the night with your behavior
after entering the lounge it kinda of creates a pleasant view with all the interior decorations
the service was good starting from the starters to the drinks and main course and finally the desserts
but at the end of the night it was the dj guy who outperformed everyone you will be the one who will make me to come to this place again and again being from north india finally got the chance to dance to those punjabi songs listening to which i have grown danced with the heart in my palm needless to say that the dj guy was the icing on the cake with his song selections
in short a happening place and if it is your day then these small things will just make your night",5,
great food amazing interior with a decent dance floor lovely ambience  good for a weekend chill out lovely staff and service drinks are good,4,

checked out the menu and found chicken afghani pepper chicken to be their favorites ordered these though zomato however zomato ruined it with delivery part the food was worth the wait

the chicken afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice the pepper chicken was bit over fried however tasty with right blend of species

i ordered rajma which turned out to be salty spiced water without any rajma in it avoid the place because quality does not seem to be given much importance,1,
ordered mealsdal makhni  rice  roti  aloo gobhi tastes really good and was fulfilling too just one thing if you could include some plastic cutlery so that we can pour curries into the bowls it is difficult to manage this in office without cutlery,5,
place is a mess was shocked to see chaos the other day and i had an upset stomach after having the food from here there was total confusion i will never order from this place again n frank opinion it reminded me of hell sorry but i spoke my mind,1,
the paneer paratha is not good as expected it need to be improved the paneer stuffed insided paratha is not seem to be fresh instead it look like worst paneer that i had eaten so far,1,
good food,5,
"ordered dal makkhani rice multiple times panner paratha is good quantity is less for one person even the large size is only served as small to medium size

packaging is nice although not separate food can not be stored supposed to be eaten as and when ordered as both dal and rice are packed together 

food seems hygienic need to work on quantity for different size meals as it is not enough",3,
visited to this place yesterday on one of my friend is recommendation found it one of the best punjabi dhaba in hyderabad the tastes remind me of punjab it offers a variety of delicious home made food pice is affordable loved the cold lassi a must visit place if you are a food lover,4,
i would recommend this place for ordering purpose the food is good in taste but being you may not find that healthy good north indian food,3,
it is awesome tasty food and hygiene food it is feel like u are in punjabi dhaba lassi is so much good in taste paneer tikka and tandoori items is good in price and taste family ac section is good and clean,5,
"1  pathetic taste of food it was one of the worst experience everi  ordered rajma  chapati and rice and rajma was too much salty aprox 10 times and same with raita too  i am sure if someone will make rajma blind folded still heshe can not make as pathetic as it was
highly disappointed",1,
"outlet was once a treat for the punjabi dishes but over the period of time the quality is going down and the socalled goooooddessst taste has been missing the mark more than once
yesterday ordered for one portion of puricholey and one portion of purialu the puris were fat and oily the alu curry was more like hingasafoetida curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley our breakfast was definitely spoiled in my last order of rajmachawal same thing had happened i really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy
wish the management will work upon the food quality because at this rate they are losing out on loyal customers",1,
"ontime deliverydelivery handling was also good food is being my favorite now
i thank to restaurant and zomato as well for better service",5,
very sad with the order the youghurtcurd used to make the lassi was utterly sour somehow managed to drink and my stomach was upset please use fresh curd,1,
"a small place nearby gachibowli circle
ambience  25
alloo kulcha tandoori is very good from this place though main course is not so good",3,
i ordered paneer paratha  sweet lassi and both were just superbone star less as salt was not appropriate in the paneer paratha overall the food was just nearing perfection the delivery was also well in time and the delivery personnel was also a well behaved guy,4,
"i have been there multiple times and have ordered food at home as well 13 dhaba has never let me down i love aloo parantha paneer tikka is mind blowing lassi is perfect chole bhature is osum poori sabzi rajma gobhi ka paranthe list is endless i have tried out everything there even i loved aloo ki sabzi and kachori but its no longer continued the place has been renovated and its nice to be there and have the real taste of punjab i make sure m there often 13 dhaba rocks and i love their hospitality these people never deny you for anything like extra pyaaz achaar or raitawhich makes it more friendly and comfortable one can pay for these extra little things but the way they show generosity in serving these asks without a frown for money make them very very friendly and makes people to go there more u ppl rock

in phtos its tandoori roti lachcha parantha aloo gobhi ki sabzi and paneer dish",5,
i ordered rajmaaloo parantha  roti  only 1 word  wow home made food  specially for those folks who come from north to south  miss taste of north disheswill definitely order again,4,
"i have ordered food from this well known paratha place
i ordered aloo paratha and paneer paratha usually their parantha is are tasty and flavorful but this time it was little bland in tastealoo paratha was still got but paneer paratha was little bland and tastless

but still wold like to say whenever i visit this palace they served hot yummy foodlove their chole bhature tooloved the way they served masala onion

follow me on instagram on veganyums for more food fun and pics",4,
half of the order was not delivered by the restaurant and they did not bother to pick the call for that,1,
"just ordered gobhi kulcha and daal makhani
kulcha full raw from both sides and no pickle and onions provided
highly disappointed and will not prefer to order again as this is the 45th time this happened
many times i have been to that place and politely gave my feedback but it seems customer satisfaction is not their priority",1,
i have been here a while back and it was really work 5 stars for it kind but there has been a loot of cost cutting it seems but it still is great for some breakfast andor lunch,4,
"awesome kulcha with kaali dal  raita
paneer combo  dal combo was good however the aloo gobi dry sabzi served with it was too salty do not order these combos instead order their yummy parathas  kulchas
ambience  15
food  45
self service only
even though it is over crowded for its size they do not make you wait like the bigger restaurants",4,
"the best place to enjoy punjabi food on weekendz its bit crowdy but on week days it is not i believe in hyderabad u cnt get amazing punjabi food moreover it is self service everyone must try lassi over there
ambience 45
food 55",5,
"best north indian food in hyderabad aloo and panner kulcha is good lassi was good rajma rice
sarso ka saag makki ki roti is good
10 discount for bullet user",5,
do you guys understand the meaning of half and full quantity while you deliver food how it affects the situation during lunch when the food delivered is incomplete and cannot be eaten by two this 1 is to ruin my personal experience with you guys as even the zomato cs was pathetic to resolve it,1,
"i ordered butter rotis but got plain rotis and tasted vary dry ",4,
i havent got my order yet,1,
very bad packing of the food it all got mixed with each other could not have the meal which i ordered pls make sure to pack properly when sending it for the delivery,1,
"i have been to this restaurant couple of times this small restaurant is situated near the gachibowli flyover
their paneer tikka is the star dish
i have also ordered aloo paratha and paneer kulcha which were too gud",4,
this place is epitome of punjabi foodif i have a craving for punjabi food i prefer this place over anyother punjabi restaurantand during lohri time this place is enlightened with joythey serve sarsoon da saag and makki di roti which is luscious,5,
eating there or getting delivered amazing amazing food have had their chole poori aloogobipanneer paratha all of which are great been there 1 time but ordered 45 times,5,
did not give paratha as mentioned in menu,1,
"this place reminds me of pune is khau galli the parathas were awesome with the butter it gave a homelike taste the priving is reasonable its a good place for coming with family the seating is sufficient for 4 people
the aloo paratha gobhi paratha and paneer paratha were delicious and upto the mark but tandoori aloo paratha and makke ki roti aur sarso ka saag were some other level very nicely cooked and incredible taste
worth a visit  highly recommended",4,
"this has been our goto place for alu ka paratha since 2013 the softness of the core and the ghee on top of it make the dish amazing

although i do not stay here any more this is one of the places i aim to go to on every visit",5,
par expectationtoo gud,5,
a place where you go to have good north indian food in hyderabad the taste of food they serve is almost similar to what we get in north india it is self service place and because of crowd the service is slow sometimes the sardar who is owner of this place is a nice and friendly chap good place to satisfy your north indian food cravings,4,
especially naans are very tasty and yummywhenever we order we will get very hotnaans with chole is very gud combinationprices are also very less compared to other restauranents,4,
"great food as always i have ordered multiple times with favs including rajma chawal kadi chawal masala raita mostly received in bottle  aloo kulcha 
bilkul ghar jaisa taste with optimum spices and quantity uploading some pics and will upload more",5,
"one of the best dhabas located in the centre of the citymust try for all the punjabi food lovers the taste of parathas mouth watering and they have the best lassi best one  service is also quick to the amount of crowd they handleswaadist bojan kao paett ka pooja karo ",4,
"that was a nice placea self servisedtake over food stall that serves the real punjabi taste in the nizam city of india ie hyderabad
i suggest u people to go and enjoy the food and you will feel really traditional ",4,
the best place to have authentic punjabi food in city the paneer tikka here is the best i have ever had dal combo is something which i would recommend anyone to take,5,
worst please stop selling chole bhature,1,
when anyone asks me about punjabi food or paranthes 13 dhaba comes to my mind i remember when everyone was praising it so much and how if you go late the paranthes get overi grabbed two of my friends and travelled nearly 30 kms  reached gachibowlistood in a long cuejust to have theor paranthas lassi moong dal halwa a heavenly and very desi experience the owners are very downtoearth punjabi folks who really live up to their name and fame do visit if you are craving authentic punjabi homecooked meals as well love this place,5,
very bad packing quality of rice and gobi curry was bad better read delivery reviews before ordering zomato should look into the quality of packing before delivering,2,
ordered kadhi pakoda rice combo nov 2018 it was extremely bad the rice seemed to be cooked with a lot of baking soda kadhi was awful to taste avoid this dish,1,
poori was very oily,2,
"we went for our friday dinner ordered the large paneer paratha which really was very large to finish it off by one person it had a good stuffing of paneer inside it was well covered with butter and along with came the ideal raita

not only we stopped here we ordered small aloo paratha gobi paratha which were hot and yummy
the chole masala was not okay but the paneer curry was delicious with paratha

last but not the least the aloo kulcha was decent along with the rajma masala we all were extremely satisfied with the food which we had here

it is a pocket friendly and nearby place a must visit for all the foodies",5,
amazing punjabi food at very affordable prices specially kadhi and rajma only the salt was a little more but otherwise yumilicious food,5,
delivery is very fast,5,
i have ordered big aloo paratha with butter pickle raita but they have only delivered paratha without anything not sure how they are expecting us to eat only dry paratha,1,
"this place servers the best kuchas and parathas in hyderabadi have been here many times and this is my first review and i absolutely love the food over here

must try items here are alu kucha chole bahturae alu onion paratha and sweet lassi

this place does not have a lot of tabels a very small outlet and self service no waiters here whothis place purely focuses on food and i think they serve the best kulchas and parathas in hyderabad

giving 5 start only for fooddo no expect any kind of ambiance  visit this place only if you eat punjabi food",5,
"taste  quality  quality  value for money
for these 4 benchmark its an good place whenever i visited this place never get disappoint
must try  dalmakhni panner kulcha chole bhature

bikecar parking is there
mostly time self service
ambience so ok but food taste balance that",4,
the quality of food is commendable the indian dishes will completely make you like this place however this is not a dining like restaurant it has a very small place it is an actual dhaba so definitely do not judge a book by its cover you get the best tastes in such places,4,
poori with aloo curry not at all good poori is like paratha and full of oil texture is very hard and curry with full of masala i had my worst breakfast,1,
"a lovely homelike food experience love the tawa parathas and chole bhature from this place must try
the packing is really good and worth the money",4,
not upto punjabi standards also packaging was not good,2,
food was great,5,
for all those who wants to have a proper north indian meal should check this place parathas with lassi will be a perfect combo for a sunday lunch panner is also great,5,
delicious food,5,
"visited yday and must say the service is poor and the ambiance is average but you visit this place for the authentic punjabi delicacies visit with clear focus and set expectations 


in the mood for some authentic punjabi food headout to 13 dhaba to taste lipsticking and finger licking food my personal favorite is the dal makhani the combos are worth a special mention here

ambience is not great but that gets compensated for by the affordability of the place recommended joint if you are around gachibowli circle",4,
"one of the amazing places in hyderbad serving good punjabi food
had aloo kulcha with dal makhani  aloo paratha with chole and paneer tikka all the dishes tasted awesome service is also good",5,
received half orderparatha with curry was delivered without curry  while paying for combo,1,
on time delivery,5,
"best punjabi corner in whole hyderabad compared to other punjabi restaurants i have been
you can see the satisfaction on my face 
from parathas to kulchas to chole bhature everything is simply delicious

must try paneer tikka soft full of spice and cooked with lots of love

happy eating",5,
the overall taste is good and i recommend paneer thali which is both reasonable and yummy but if you order paranthas then the north indian taste that a parantha has is little missing overall combos are good and thali is too are nice option to go for,3,
"we had been wanting to visit 13 dhaba for quite some time having heard the raving reviews about their north indian preparations finally ended up trying their steaming hot gobsmacking parathas and they are truly some of the best you can find in hyderabad 

the aloo tawa paratha is actually stuffed with loads of filling as compared to other places that serve doughy parathas the paneer kulcha was also smothered in butter and served with onions and curd
we ordered the small aloo paratha but it was ginormous and we were almost full by the time we were done with it 

they serve other north indian delicacies like rajma chawal kadhi chawal dal makhni and lassi which are on our totry list",4,
the food was prepared quickly and was also delivered on time however the salt in both the dishes ordered was very high hence faced difficulties in eating please balance the spices in order to not to spoil the food,3,
"ye dhaba nhi hota to hyd m mera kya hota  parathe kulcha bhature aalu gobhi makhni every thing you get here at good price i am ordering from here from last 2 and half years
2 think do not like here one paneer paratha and masala rayta they do not give option for normal curd",4,
located near the gachibowli orr circle 13 dhaba is easily accessible they had a wide variety of parathas and north indian dishes we had taken gobhi paratha and alookulcha both tasted great the ambience is not that good as it just a roadside stop overall for a quick eatery this can be bookmarked,4,
good,5,
the true punjabi affair i must say we heard about this place from our buddies and man it was so good we ordereded all the varities like parathas tikas and the lassi at the lastrecomended,5,
by far the best aalo paranthas i ever had in hyderabad righly cooked with appropriate stuffing served with masala raita and daal makhni i will recommend their butter naan and daal makhni to everyone who crave for north indian meal will definitely order again,5,
i didnt get what i orderedi ordered dal makhni combo and i got combo without dal makhni just got rice roti and onionterrible service,1,
decent food with good quality dal makhani aaloo gobhi are good amongst the bread stuffed kulcha and lachcha paratha are nice it is a pocket friendly place and the quantity served is good enough,4,
did not like tandoori paneer paratha much paneer makhani was average,3,
"rangadhar is service is amazing love to be here always  great food and hospitality  highly recommended ",5,
ordered aloo gobhiaverage taste chapatis were soft,3,
i agree they provide food better than ordinary but i would definitely not recommend people to order from here they provided incomplete order which is ok it can happen but over that they were not responsible too their behaviour is very rude which is not professional it sounded as if it is my fault not theirs,1,
"okay so i am not a veg person usually but then it was raksha bandhan yesterday and i had to abide by the rules now thinking of punjabi restaurants or dhabas we usually picturize sinfully delicious nonveg dishes but 13 dhaba is an amazing pure veg punjabi restaurant and trust me the food there will not let you down

on my plate buttery aloo parathapaneer makhaniraita

the paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha so imagine how ginormous is the stuffing was perfect neither too less nor too much the paneer was very softly cooked and absorbed the flavors of the spices and the gravy too was amazing the raita with a bit of pepper in it added to the beauty of the lunch",4,
i am giving a bad rating not to the restaurant but because of zomato everytime i order food the instructions are not properly relayed to the restaurant and i end up getting something which i can not eatfor example spicy or with onions they simply refuse to cancel the order and even if i ping them separately everytime they say system gitch  very bad delivery service by zomato zomato clearly does not care about it customers but may be they will listen to the restaurants may be because due to zomato restaurant is name is going for a sale here,1,
amazing taste ordered chole paneer dish and almost all the naans quantity is also good compared to the price lassi and milk thandai were not so good but the most important thing why i wouldnt rate it high is it is self service policy the place is too small and even water is not served not even tissue papers,3,
got dal chawal instead of dal makhni,1,
paneer paratha is paneer was not good,2,
burnt naan,2,
"got to know about this by watching uber eats vedio and mouth publicity perfect place for a punjabi family and authentic punjabi food lovers

the paneer tikka i had here is the best i ever had till date it was totally cooked and servered with butter over paratas are huge enought to serve one and tests your appettite stuffing is very good served with butter over and masala ratia
reccommend to go with a group so that you can taste all togeather

combos and different rice items available special 10 discount for bicycle and bullet riders self service so get your food own service is too good the person treat with huge respect worth visiting the place",4,
quantity of the food is very less for a single person,2,
the paneer curry  jeera rice was super awesome i still cannot forget the taste thanks for the treat veggie folks do visit the restaurant,5,
d,5,
ordered butter naan completely jalgayaaa and very very difficult to chew and eat not at all gooodpanner makhani is also not al good,2,
i ordered dal makhni  garlic naan and butter roti it was not good at all it tasted a bit sour like a stale food roti n naan were hard to chew,1,
food was good,4,
have ordered from this place a couple of times and i must say that i have not had better alu parathas in hyderabad than what they serve here they are filled in so generously unlike most places that you can literally see small chunks of potatoes falling from them,4,
fast delivery and taste is really superb,5,
very good guy thank you,5,
dont lije masala rayta,4,
very bad taste including vegetarian and nonvegetarian deserts were stale paneer was like rubber ac was not working and very bad service,1,
"this one is simple they have great food be it whichever cuisine especially the starters and my favorite thai curry however they could work on the service i have been here multiple times one time we kept waiting for a waiter and nobody was willing to turn up and the other time we got there at 10 pm and they were trying to get us out the minute we entered by insisting it will be last order would we prefer takeaway so on so forth and this is when they were serving quite a good number of tables
full marks on food none on service ambience is that of a typical restaurant in a fancy hotel you know what i mean",4,
worst experience with this hotel food taste was very bad no attention from servers we even does not know that there are rotis and icecream no one bothered to serve only peanuts was good among all the food but for peanuts 1000 bugs is too much and most special thing is a tile from wall fell down where a customer missed it in a inch plz do not sit at the last,1,
"not recommended for sure average quality and highly overpriced took eternity to serve chapati that too cold ones desserts were good as they have menu options
overall disappointed",1,
bad experience food is fine but their ac is not working and staff says this is out of their control we were sweating did not expected this from such reputed restaurant,2,
"went to this amazing place quite sometime back it is a very pretty romantic place for a fine dining experience

great food service and hospitality they had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience i would suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones better to reserve a table in advance

lovely taste in food delicious mushroom soup and the quattro formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth loved the appetizers and desserts as well

must try forest mushroom soup crispy corn pepper salt quattro formaggi tiramisu

would actually give it a 455",4,
awesome white sauce pasta and chicken pizza great place to go been here multiple times pasta is consistently amazing to eat plus zomato gold is great plus,5,
"had a lovely experience with my daughter at jonathan is kitchen once again we love to eat at this place as it has as awesome menu

we are very happy with the service provided was yamuna as she helped in customizing the dishes for my daughter thanks",5,
very good food and service butter garlic prawns are particularly good staff in particular a lady named yamuna was very polite and helpful,5,
"visited with family for dinner on a special occasion
the valet parking was a relief
unfortunately there was no maitre would and we had to seat ourselves
the ambience was great  i loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening

the food was really good the sushi even the veg variant was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb

service however was lacking on all parameters it was cold and inefficient it was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out couple of women in particular  could not catch their names the billing too took an unreasonable amount of time

the food here is great but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3 quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant

will we return perhaps not in the near future  the only reason we would return at some point would be zomato gold on the food",3,
been to this place twiceonce with friends and ordered ala carte and other with collegues for a buffet loved both the experiences the food here is really goodunlike others i will start with the dessertlove their creme brule the best and followed by their baked cheesecakeshave tried their chickn burgers pizzas and thai cuisine as welli loved the burgers the best followed by thai currybuffet was less impressive than ala carte but was happy with the varietywhic included hyderabadi cuisine apart form meditteraneanmust place to visit in hydereabad,4,
"went for lunch with friendsala carte liked the ambiencethough it was really far to get to we had the caesar salad which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning pizza arabiatareally nice crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty penne pastachicken was also good though the chicken seemed dry the best dish was thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine ricethe best ever flavoursa must try now coming to the desserts we had the philadelphia cheese cake bakednice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly creme brule was goodloved the crispy carmelized sugar crust
there was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders overall it was a nice experience hope to have a better one next time",3,
"i think there is no point of taking a buffet here i took a buffet for the purpose of having mutton curry but it was spoilt hence there was no benefit from paying 2000 for 2 people

i took this plate like this i left this plate like this",1,
"over rated i feel it is desserts are good

jonathan kitchen had been on my check list for quite some time i was very happy when we finally went over a weekend for the buffet

the early impressions were not great as it seemed very crowded and the ambiance wasnt bright which aroused a non positive vibe as we dint want to go to another restaurant at that time we proceeded to have the buffet

except for the desserts section which was huge i was disappointed with the overall quality of the food the taste want great and at the same time the meat had a lot of bones service was bad there was always a shortage of plates and the dessert spoon they gave me was the highlight of the whole experience ",2,
"this is by far the best buffet option on weekdays

the spread is wonderful and quite enjoyable for vegetarians i loved the pizza and some of the continental starters

the main course options were also wonderfully flavorful

and the desert spread also had more than a dozen options

not for the weight watchers ",5,
"a great place for pleasant evening dinner not too noisy

we ordered a pizza and risotto pizza was great lots of veggies and nice crispy crust risotto was nice and had good texture not an expert on risotto but liked it overall

quality of service is really good though very few people know details about the menu like which dishes are recommended etc

"heard a lot about this place and many suggested that it is a must try i finally tried this and it was a lit they have a very interesting a la carte menu with food from different cuisines

the ambiance good and pretty much similar to any fine dining restaurant except wobbling chairs

i found service quite quick and clean food was brought to table right on time the quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money

everything i tried were perfectly done and delivered

chicken peking style peri peri chicken breast fish and chips crispy veg uramaki sushi",4,
"i was invited to this place by one of my friends to have a dinner and experience the hospitality that jonathan is kitchen provide

let me talk about the ambience  the place is very well designed and maintained the lighting at the place is very warm and cosy perfect place to have a romantic outing as well as family time

now coming to food  for the starters we ordered tiger prawns  butter garlic prawns  mutton sikampuri kebab crispy corn

out of all the butter garlic prawns were the highlight i would go back to this place just for butter garlic prawns

for the main course we ordered beef steak and rice and dal tadka though i am not a fan of beef and i do not eat  my friends told that it was too good dal tadka was awesome

overall this is a perfect place to have dinner and lunch  i would definately recommend this",5,
ordered achari paneer tikka through dwight and for a restaurant that claims to be a top notch restaurant and charges exorbitant rates for the samethey sent stale stinky paneer tikka which had to be thrown in the dustbin extremely disappointed money lost and no replacement provided from the restaurantnot worth it,1,
"hyderabadifoodtherpay
one of the best buffets you can have in hyd is at jonathan is kitchen a very calm place with a beautiful ambience every dish will make you realize that you did not do any mistake by coming at this place this is a togo place for every one

a decent place overall it has a nice ambience though it can get pretty crowded and noisy during peak hours the menu is pretty wideranged we ordered a couple of appetizers and a pasta in main course appetizers were not very good chilli broccoli was too oily however the pasta was really good,4,
my steak experience here was a lovely one though i asked for medium rare done steak i was served a well done chunk of chewey meat that i did not appreciate the sides however were perfectly made and impressed me all on their own the light and brightly lit interiors with white flowy curtains that never allow harsh sunlight to make eye contact make this place lovely for a laid back brunch the eatery has an aura of tranquility that you simply cannot deny,4,
"i have heard lot about the place but finally tonight i managed to visit it they have an interesting and a wide range of a la carte menu and thats what we all were hoping to try out
the ambiance is similar as of any fine dining restaurant
i heard reviews about their service being a bit slower but luckily i did not experience that tonight might be due to the lesser rush on a weekday night rather i found the service quite good
the quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money

recommendations
blackened salmon steak
rib eye steak one of the very few places in hyderabad where they served an actual medium rare steak
sirloin steak
cilantro fish
jumbalaya
cheese cake with blue berry compote",4,
"it was a lovely experience we ordered kimchi fried rice and exotic assorted veggies with chili basil sauce loved both of them they were properly cooked  mushrooms in kimchi fried rice were just delicious
not to forget the dessert baked alaska it is a must try
4 stars coz it is quite far baring that it is a pretty sweet restaurant",4,
went on a saturday night nice cosy placewell lit and classy ambiance opted for ala carte as we had a snack on our way we were in a little early and found ourselves a good place to sit ordered a burger and pizza both were lip smacking portion size was huge absolute vfm zomato gold helps keep the place pocket friendly  will surely visit again,5,
"i have visited jonathan is kitchen on many occasions one thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant their service is not so nice also they denied us zomato gold services saying we were sitting in komatose however as per their front staff they told us to sit in komatose as they did not have seat in jonathan is kitchen but the food menu and staff will all be from jonathan is hence we sat and ordered and later found out no gold accepted
i have tried their buffet ala cart sushi and everything else nothing extraordinary the only benefit is it is close to my place",3,
came to get dinner made a reservation in advance sat for the first 10 mins waiting for someone to get a menu and water after 20 mins of waiting for water and asking a few times for someone to take the order we decided to leave when no one came still no questions asked on why we are leaving i guess one can plan a visit if they have a lot of time in their hands and or are not hungry had heard good things but this experience changes my mind completely will not recommend it for the service,1,
go to place for office team dinners food is simply amazing with a large variety of dishes being served felt the lighting can be improved a bit,4,
did not enjoy our evening at all just realised not to order sushi if it is not an authentic japanese restaurant nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice i made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take waiters were very transactional told them it is my daughter is birthday and asked for a cake they had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that is all they can offer we will ordered the cake and had her cut it none of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake why do i bring this up cos this is a 34 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous service was very slow overall a lousy experience,2,
the place has a nice vibe and the dishes are really tasty and they have a lot of options in buffet very nice ambience and polite waiters the place little pricey but good to go with family,4,

one of the few places in hyderabad to boast of delicious cuisines amazing ambienence and splendid live music a big shout to surendra  for the exceptional service they offer a wide spread of dishes and drinkswe had gone for buffet and enjoyed the night thoroughly would definitely recommend any foodie,5,
exceptional service by the team especially surendra thanks for having us and giving us a great time with amazing drinks and food anil gave us a great service too,5,
"amazing food super amazing staff love all d stuff be it continental italian japanese or indian 

kids friendly lively n lovely  thank u so much yamuna for all d suggestions  hv all been super delicious n for ur hospitality

keep it up guys",5,
very bad service food was not good they took lot of time for clearing the plates arranging tables  had to pay the money without bill not worth at all for that price,1,
"i love the food here they have a great spread for their buffet however i have never had the buffet so i wouldnt comment on the taste but the spread is definitely good cz i checked that out i come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their fish items from the grill section i have had the blackened salmon steak cilantro fish and the murrel crust and have loved each one however if i had to pick one it would be the salmon and that too would win by a very close margin apart from their fish i love their spring chicken and chicken confit as well if you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit

coming to the ambiance it is minimalistic and chic the staff is polite and warm they have a zomato gold offer on food so that is amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side i definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly",5,
"i have been there for quite a few time now for brunch ala cart as well as only for dessert

brunch they do have a hell variety of items and i am sure you will not be able to taste them alli liked their starters very much which had egg options pan cakes sautee vegetables idly dosa and many moreit was fulfilling in itselfif you also love brunch than it is definitely worth trying and value for money

dessert i went their only for dessert once and had tiramisu and chocolate ganacheboth of them tasted amazingexcept tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving

one of the worst places to visit horrible experience we waited for 45 min after placing our order and then walked out of the place without eating anything first they misplaced the order at a time when there was only two other busy tables and then they had the audacity to come with a pizza and offer us and then realize that it was for someone else,1,
"best place ever jonathan is kitchen

grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice it was so good chili chicken was not much spicy it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner crispy corn i have tried at many restaurants and i loved flechazo is before but now i can say the best crispy corn is at jonathan is kitchen i think this is the best compliment chicken wings for this just one word magnificent

then my favorite part were the prawns here we tried 3 different types of prawns butter garlic prawns this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable dragon prawns one of my friends suggested me to try this here mr tarak the name itself represents dragon prawns it is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns tiger prawns these were too large in size i have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters

then we ordered some mocktails because it is mandatory orange delight cucumber n mint virgin pina colada black current spicy tango and blue lagoon or blue heaven every mocktail has their own specialty orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening black current is really good in taste and refreshing spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails every mocktail is best at jonathan is kitchen

then it is time for main course in that we ordered dal tadka and rara gosht with butter naan and amritsari kulcha and burnt fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy every dish just left us speechless dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and amritsari kulcha burnt fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at jonathan is kitchen

but without dessert i never end my dinner so here we ordered gulab jamun chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and cream brulee with fresh fruits all the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner

this was my second trip here after a long gap in between overall fine experience service is good we ordered the prawn sushi and jambalaya the taste of the food is good liked the sushi though found the pieces a little too big the jambalaya was good in taste and presentation overall good ambience with decent food liked the ambience and service better than the food,3,
"this place is overrated donno why it is rating and taste does not match we had a team lunch here food looked pleasing with vibrant colors but taste was tasteless please carry salt  pepper along only dish which our group enjoyed was curd rice  peanut chat
taste  rating  cost has no connection among themselves",1,
i suggest pls pls do not visit this place  such a worst food i never experienced the worst experience is i found a bug in a blue berry cheese cake and also so many flies  i would rate 0 if i had a chance  no smiling service would again and again suggest do not visit this place,1,
they said it is one of the best buffets in the city and my experience says otherwisethe service of the place can test your patience in manyways when it is packedeverything that was there in the buffet was icecold from starters to maincourseseriously guys huge disappointment this one wasbeen here for lunch on holidayeven though i made a reservation before hand it took 30 min for us to get a tableservice i always let go even if the service is not uptothemark cause it is understandable and afterall they are humanthis one was unacceptableit was a buffeteverything selfservice only thing they are supposed to do was provide cutlery which they failed even after asking for multiple timesi walked upto the cutlery table to get it myself and they gave me 2 spoons and one plastic spoon for a table of 6the taste of the food in the buffettotal offbelow average spread and tastenothing caught my attention to even write about itthe kebabs were all drythe classic crispy corn was rock hard the fish curryi think they accidentally put fish in the salt gravywhy is it so hypedi still do not get itmay be i visited this on restaurent is bad daybut it was a bad lunch day for me and my friendswe just know how to have fun in the crisisgood for usotherwise you can land up in a huge disappointment,2,
"one of hyderabad is most stylish fine dining places jonathan is kitchen serves lipsmacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu the luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions i was here for a tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time

we started off with some amazing starters butter garlic prawns grilled pomfret dragon prawns crispy corn pepper salt chicken wonton and nawabi shikampuri kebab the prawns were just fabulous they were a perfect start to our dinner grilled pomfret was also very good crispy corn were the best that i have ever had they have topped my last best opinion chicken wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great lastly the nawabi shikampuri kebab were very juicy and succulent

next we had some of the finest mocktails orange delight cucumber n mint virgin pina colada black currant spicy tango and blue lagoon or blue heaven all of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course while still enjoying the appetizers although virgin pina colada was not that great and orange delight the best

we had an array of dishes from the main course starting off with the ambrosial chateaubriand tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream it is a high end dish and it did keep it is name

then we savored rara gosht and dal tadka curries with butter naan and amritsari kulcha both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds lastly we had fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy this was an absolute favourite of all a tempting and toothsome chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky indo chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night

we ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts a classic gulab jamun a fruity creme brulee and a luscious chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream a perfect end to an amazing dinner we had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again",5,

"the place had too many mosquitos
food was served cold and was below average
service was not upto the mark
ambience was good
not worth it",2,
worst service i ever experienced if we order an item no one take responsibility to bring it they will stay at the corner and chit chat each other there was a lady i said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off they will replace items after 20min we have to wait for that item even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5 at last i feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and i find an cockroache in the bowl i called the lady and waiter they did not responded then i went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 ice creams we were around 30 people and he saying to come in the evng or next day i do not know what they think about the customers basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe at least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late i heard lot about jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good but the people their behaviour and neatness was very very bad kindly find the attachment thank you and i never visit u,2,
"writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of hyderabad jonathan is kitchen

went to celebrate my bday todayit was the worst food buffet i ever had in any above average costly restaurantthey charge so high for this shitty buffet

1 ambience even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall no theme no decoration
2 service no serving of starters no serving of even water until u askno serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here
3 food the worst part of itsome stale starters of chicken and fish veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days oldone chicken starter only had some taste main course is also pretty below averagepasta is goodpizzaso called best hyderabadi pizza was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza
deserts they put some sweets of local shops as deserts
two juices as welcome drinks were ok

i gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bdaythanks for that

they themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la cartewill do that if i will ever try to take this risk again",2,
"worst dining experience i ever had till now

service staff was extremely rude so slow that we had to cancel a few items after waiting for 45 minutes and asking multiple times for it",1,
nice ambiance this place has a very good fine dining experience the food is good too a little expensive but is worth the price i used zomato gold so received a nice discount on food,5,
we went here for a friend is birthday the service is extremely bad the servers routinely forgot orders and various dishes did not come and they still charged us for the same we had to fight to get those off the bill the food is also bland and nothing to write home about extremely disappointed not at all recommended,1,
quality of food is really great ingredients are top of the line which give a great product a must visit service is equally great our food took some time but it was worth the wait  the restaurant was busy with the sunday brunch and probably alacarte orders need equal attention,5,
had a really boring day at office so i invited my friends for a lunch at jonathon is kitchen the place has a really nice atmosphere i ordered dragon prawns  which was as nice as it could that i thought of ordering again my friends ordered soup which is the most hateful thing by me in food the prawns were really soft crunchy and tasty the vegetables onions bell peppers were all tasted good due to harmony between the sauces used to cook the prawns as main course we ordered salmon steak which was really the size of a steak with vegetables and creamy sauce i like usual  ordered indian cuisine which was butter naan and chicken tikka masala which was really suffice for me the taste was also good as a whole the food had all the qualities that would make me to visit the place again it had the taste  the aroma and the visuals were also tempting to try the dish as soon as it is served,5,
bad experience the dishes ordered were cold and all were brought together on table ie appetizers and main course sushi was very bad in taste  pina colada was just mild cold chilli broccoli was served dry without any sauces and post requesting 34 times the garlic sauce was served overall not worth it even one star and my last ever visit,1,
we have to been to this place on a friday afternoon lunch with my team the place is so big and it can accommodate more that 100 people in the restaurantcoming to the buffet spread it was really huge and lot many variety is we got this on a dineout deal for 550 which is quite reasonable looking forward to visit the place again,4,
average food not tasty enough and not worth the price of the buffet better to choose some other option than this until its the only option,2,
"great place to enjoy your weekend the food is amazing even had live music on sunday
we opted for lacarte and ordered dahi ke kabab thai basil praws fresh lime soda strawberry mocktail penne arrabiata and chocolate fondue cake
dahi ke kababs were very nice and soft like they should be thai basil prawns were also nice and tasty they were properly cooked and well served fresh lime soda waswell fresh lime soda but strawberry mocktail was super sweet and is a must try penne arrabiata pasta is one dish that i would recommend you all to try here the gravy was super thick and delicious the pasta was boiled perfectly and the presentation was also good coming to the dessert i never had such an amazing fondue not too sweet just the prefect balance of chocolate and sweetness overall had an amazing time here

"ambience 55 both indoors and outdoors facility
value for money 355 this is with respect to sunday brunch costing rs 1200 per person
staff service 55

quality of food 55 simply premiumitems i like the most are veg maki sushi broccoli salad from their regular menubut even more outstanding are their live counter options such as tawa fish not your regular bland boneless fish but the way you eat fish at home had some real flavour omelette french toast pancakes were simply brilliant
variety of food 55 enormousthis is where jonathan is kitchen truly excels there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with they claim to have over 60 items on their menu which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table
in the name of unlimited drinks there was no real variety to choose from i could not even get my favourite soft drink thums up franchise issue probably i know and on that particular day there was not any option of pina colada
i am a big fan of lettuce leafs please keep some",4,
"i went there for lunch on a sunday afternoon four of us were there for lunch out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for  la carte i was among the two who went for  la carte for the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band the ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded they offer open air seating as well the starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor personally i felt the seating is not much comfortable as the chairs backrest lacked comfort the air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside was not as comfortable as i expected it to be however the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can
coming to the food i had ordered mutton sukha rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns my companions went for the sunday brunch as they told me the nonvegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless all the starters were very well balanced in flavour the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite compared to the starters the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing prawn cocktail was outstanding the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet coming to the  la carte menu the mutton sukha was great in every way the spices were perfectly balanced they werent overpowering the flavour of the meat it is definitely a must try there the rib eye steak did not impress me much the meat was not juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing on the other hand the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant they were served on a bed of sautd spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour
overall it is a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world",4,
"lousy staff and lousy service i went for dinner buffet and except a few things i did not like anything the deserts were really really bad with so many options and none of them were good
the only good thing is the ambience i do not recommend this place at all",3,
this is one of the best place if you are looking for a quiet calm place for dinner or lunch the ambiance is greatstaff is excellent and food is to the point the buffet has nice variety in saladsstarters and desertmain course is average in buffet but a la carte is amazing the quality of everything served is greati luv going back to this place,4,

ps  the sushi is a must try",5,
"i visited this place for a lunch buffet recently

they have wide spread of starters main course veg pizzapasta on table and huge variety of deserts

food taste was ok but nothing different

they have only butter naan and tandoori roti",3,
they have a very good spread in their buffet the nonveg dishes have a unique flavour and taste which keeps this restaurant different from others especially the mexican chicken and fish all the varieties in veg are good ambience and service is excellent,4,
"this review has been long overdue i visited this place for my birthday and gawd i was not disappointed at all  the place has this really sophisticated minimal design which is not too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room
the service is just amazing  every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points
now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant the food the food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it mediterranean or italian as a matter of fact even indian
now i do not want to go into detail with all that i ordered and describe it i will attach images with this review and i will let the images talk for themselves albeit i would like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit to begin with i would like to talk about the pizza this was one of the finest pizzas i have ever had in hyderabad drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned
moving forward i would like to talk about the mutabak the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get i would have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called mediterranean restaurants the carbonara was perfectly cooked in the italian way the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe
to summarize this i would say yes this place is a must visit and i would definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners this place is the place to be ",5,
amazing food the way they serve it will make you even happier great presentation of food must visit if nearby also not that pocket heavy for a fine dine,4.5,
"ambience very sophisticated
food  in terms of variety its great we had continental pastas pizza are to die for fish and chips were just ok nothing so great
desert cheesecake is a treat
and frozen alaska was pretty bad 1 less star only for that",4,
i love clean and well lighted restaurants jonathan is kitchen is certainly one of them soft music nice and clean seating arrangement appeals you to have a good meal there i ordered minestrone alla genovese soup thai green veg curry agnolotti pasta and chocolate fondant cake all were delicious and really lives upto your expectations i expected the chocolate fondant cake to be bit warm but it was not food is amazing,5,
got food poison after eating quesadilla yesterday122 had to admit in hospital for a day had to spend 4k inr will never recommend this to anyone,1,
went for a sunday brunch with family the spread is absolutely massive though veg options were limited especially starters however the food itself is lip smacking good no matter what we tried the staff was courteous and always available to assist ambience was nice though the live music was a little too loud for our liking,4,
"jonathan is kitchen but jonathan was not there o

lol

so i went there for my anniversary lunch lovely experience

we went on a working day of the week  and that too in lunch hours

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience

the food was good service was ok surprisingly price is also okish
a bit pricey u can say
rating  3  coz the waitersservers who were completely free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service

anyways they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration so that was nice",4,
has got nice ambience and the food tastes good they have got one of the best pesto pastas in the city also love the crispy chicken burger it is very tender inside and crispy outside as said blueberry cheese cake has not had enough coolness hope to manage to get a better one next time very friendly people fo jonathan is,4,
after two widely separated visits i am positively impressed by jonathan is kitchen both the lunch buffet as well as the alacarte dinner were fulfilling experiences in different manners while the lunch buffet was simply ginormous with it being impossible to even taste all the dishes the dinner was apt for a quiet relaxed evening with some amazing continental food 4 stars earned,4,
"this was on my list since few months and finally we went for a sunday buffet
ambience is good with cool music and performance
service ok
food not satisfied
my review is only on vegetarian food
starters
there were 5 veg starters 2 paneer crispy corn cheese poppers and mixed veg crispy corn was disappointing and others were good
live counter
dosa was ok and gobi paratha was good
main course
i could not taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime
all the gravy items were ok
deserts
the dishes were mysore pak kaaja banana in hot jaggery liquid kaju burfi one type of laddu apple crunch answer kalakand
kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok when i called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but i could not find even 40 vegetarian items there i booked buffet in dineout offer so it was good deal for me in general i felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive",3,
i went to jonathan is with team i fell in love with their ambience and seating their buffet spread is good and seats are comfortable coming to food i had the best buffet everything is so good,5,
good service  polite people enjoyed pretty much went in a group of 9 guys the sunday brunch was cool awesome food and the drinks in package were satisfactory,5,
"after having dinner buffet here really wonder hiw come thia place has this rating food service ambiancenothing stood out for me met friends here for dinner and was not impressed food is ok spread is average service is good  but thats expected not exceptional most disappointing was the setup very average considering its a above average priced and a hotel restaurant
easily avoidable",3,
"great buffet great food good service nice location is there anything else you desire
everything from the service to the food is awesome here the fish was especially wonderfulust go here if you are in hyderabad",4,
another immensely satisfying experience at jonathan is if you are looking for fine ingredients a diverse menu warm and friendly service and most of all a consistent great taste you wouldnt go wrong picking this place highly recommend the lamb murtabak and the pizzas and wild mushroom risotto definitely repeat visitworthy,5,
"saturday night unlimited buffet with drinks at 1500 plenty of starter to go with cilantro fish chickenprawnsbaby corncheese poppers pav etc ballentines option in the drink loved the service and enjoyed the live music ",4,
"this was one of those places on my list that i have been wanting to try for the longest time that i can remember i specifically wanted to try out the sushi veg in this place i remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available in any case i ordered a stater shanghai rolls which was average and finally went ahead and ordered sushi for myself  wife and a pizza for my daughter the sushi was good but not as good as the one i had tried at mamagoto my fav place for asian cuisine the pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic italian restaurants in the city i also tried their creme brulee best of the lot which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping in my opinion they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself i would have rated it 35 but for their really slow service and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings 

all in all an average place to try out i might go back to try some of their other items on the menu

"vegetarian review on lunch buffet
pros
great service
starter and deserts are the winner here satisfied
spacious and comfortable
main course isi can say not bad

cons
asked for nan and we got it when we already finished our lunch
icecream not available i have asked there but the guy told me there is no icecream available i got to know from my colleague that they serve ice cream on demand this is wired

thank you for your service",4,
"one of the few times when the reviews and the hypes are absolutely off the mark

went for grill and chill on saturday night not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination

ambience  it is ok nothing spectacular chairs werent very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience

service  this is the truly sad part really slow service and servers are uninterested this really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property

food  starters were 4 varieties of chicken 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice but unfortunately everything was served cold you ask for hot starters and you get cold starter is again

main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening chicken curry was decent desserts were ok as well

overall the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average barbecue nation does a much better job

the best part  they gave tissues instead of regular napkin  and plastic spoons for dessert pathetic

vfm  rs 3000 for 3 people and you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert i am glad they did not give us paper plates lol

not going again",1,
very nice restaurant we tripped on italian cuisine and it does not disappoint you staff is very friendly and helpful there is a live band playing outdoors decent enough the place also has a very good selection of burgers,5,
nice restaurant  good burger but the interiors could be better  very basic interior they should upgrade the interior  otherwise nice food i guess,4,
"a quick dinner for last sunday of 2018 landed us in jonathan is kitchen we ordered red thai curry with rice for main course and fish soy chilli for starter
fish soy chilli was spoton specially for a wintry night thai curry was tasty however rice quantity was quite less for the curry accompanying it
ambience is quite good with oriental decoration",4,
"after hearing from friends we planned to visit this place on a sunday
food  45
ordered pasta alfredo primavera pizza butter naanbad paneer makhani all items were good my family loved them

ambience  255  beautiful soothing lights average setup cant consider a very peaceful place bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit

service  15  this is one area that needs improvement 5 of us were offered a table of 4 would have managed but it was too small and with kids situation became worse we were served just once no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything it is supposed to be waiters waiting tables but we were the ones waiting 

will i take my kids  35  its less spicy kid friendly menu but there is not much for kids to enjoy and no finger bowls 

will i take my parents  35  elderly would like the place and menu options decent groups around options in north indian italian etc are enjoyable for them

value for money  355

washrooms  25

location  easy to find valet parking available

used zomato gold here",2,

we went here for an afternoon buffet the place was a little crowded because of an office party buffet spread is good the food is tasty we enjoyed the soup paneer veg balls dhal makani veg biriyani dessert has variety and quite good we enjoyed the food ala carte seemed to take time the table next to us was occupied the same time as us but were served when we were on desserts,4,
"it was on my birthday i visted this place
ambience service and location of this place is spot on
choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly right balance of indian chinese etc
we ordered a chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy succulent and fresh
chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be d you will not get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places
tried sushi for the first time it was served with a green pickle which is super spicy a pinch of it can actually make you cry and pickled ginger felt sushi is not made for my palate d forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks finally had with fork and spoon lol
we ordered 2 mocktails as well which were not there in the menu suggested by waiter both of them tasted good  waiters could have been more attentive other than that no complaints
overall it was a nice dinner on an occasion of birthday",5,
"ambience is good and the staff here is very polite
miss yamuna the hostess especially  i would recommend this place to everyone out there",5,
"the best place to be if you want to see some sport screening
what i really liked about the place is they have round about 42 screens and no matter where you sit you will have 56 screens which will be clearly visible
no fight or waiting to get place near to the screen

we went here during ipl screening
it was really a great experience

what we had ordered was ultimate nachoschicken wings with chipotle sauce and pizza

i went on a special day  so there was a live music band playing but it was too loud so the brightness and the loud music did not do justice to so much as setting the mood

food was ok taste wise but price was on the higher side limited variety of food but they have done some nice experiments with the wings so  try worthy

but there are very nice people working there very friendly nice staff service was very good

along with that if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion then what a hit a road side sports bar would be

the place i prefer most for good taste and enjoyment more levels of ice cream so shakes and many more i like the chacolte flavour the most,5,
we had ordered from amul and we will order again we were looking for a late night binge and found amul on zomato we ordered some choco chips 55 and alphonso mango 55 ice cream and loved them only thing is the ice creams although provided with dry ice had started melting which was not desirable i wish amul can improve their packaging so that ice cream reaches intact,4,
thankyou for serving testy milkshakes in late night i am suggesting my friends to try milkshake in this place specialy dry furit milkshake,5,
"although i did not go to the onsite store but i have ordered some ice cream  from there  they are too yumm  one can have them whenever they wish too
i am very much impressed with there style of packing the food 
the service was also good  the items were delivered on time 
the taste is dam good and they have a wide variety of flavors with them 
they make sure that the icecream did not melt by the time it reaches to the customer  that made me cheerful",4,
"this is a small ice cream parlourit has all good ice cream and i ate death by chocolate in this their hot brownie and on that hot chocolate sauce was their and scooped with 3 icecreams and it is around 170rsi ate ice cream mixed with chocolate brownie its like heaven for meit is topped with choco chips and choco sticksya amul maintained its qualitythey gave more in quantity and 3scoops were to much to me
food 55
ambience 25
packaging 55
overall 45",4,
ordered nutty fruity ice cream which is mango and strawberry crazy combination and the roasted almonds which is awesome in this hot summer and the delivery boy done a great job but the packing was in plastic cover which usually delivered in amul branding cover just saying but still i do not mind until the ice cream was good and great job amul  excited to have more ice creams in this hot summer,5,
i am a regular customer when it comes to ordering from amul i ordered all chocolate ice cream from amul according to the description there was supposed to be perk and kitkat and hot chocolate fudge in it but there was nothing of it it was a normal choco chips icecream which i could have got for 80rs instead i paid 180rs for it my suggestion just order basic icecreams from amul do not go for anything else which is costly and when the delivery boy delivered the icecream it was melting disappointed by the service of the outlet,1,
have ordered from here so many times but when i got the wrong order the restaurant doesnt trust me and expects me to go through a hassle so that they ll get convinced and send me the correct itemasked for anjeer and got something elsesent a photo to zomato and the restaurant wants me to talk to someone else and take their number and send then photos and wait for their replyno one has so much time and customer service shud be easier,1,
thank you delivered on time,5,
we have ordered ice creams multiple times from amul love the variety available on their menu quantity is really good more than what i get when ordered from other ice cream parlours value for money with great taste,5,
ordered tropical sunrise sundae with chocolate syrup base choco chips and fruit poison ice cream both were mind blowing fruit poison had exotic fruits like kiwi and strawberry and tasted really well the tropical sundae had a cocoan and dark chocolaty aftertaste they know their stuff well and i will prefer their items over cream stone for sure,4,
need to improve the food quality ordered hot choclate brownie with vanilla ice cream which was not good bownie was hard no hot choclate found vanilla ice cream alone was good,1,
very late delivery,1,
the best place for icecreams i love it you should try choco brownie almond for sure quantity n quality is amazing availble always for online orders,5,
amul icecream tastes best i have tasted many flavours from the menu delivery is also cool with the dry ice covers the icecream i must recommend to try all the flavours they have from budget to premium ice cream,4,
"ordered afghani nuts icecream gotta say the quantity was more than what i expected and the amount of nutsdryfruits was generous ice cream was smooth and tasty would definitely order again
packaging was superb they put in dryice to keep it cool appreciate the effort

edit
orered hot brownie with vanilla icecream once again the packaging was very thoughtful they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and icecream with dry ice to keep it cool
it tasted very delicious quantity was ample could not finish it alone it is good enough as dessert for 2 people

will keep ordering from amul  ",5,
tutty frooty icecream is not good,3,
delivered the food ontime thanks,5,
please provide spoons with ice cream,3,
ordered death by chocolate and received butterscotch and some other ice cream giving two stars because zomato doesnt show the reviews that receive 1 star,2,
"amul brand is good for milk but not for ice creams
they tried too hard to fit in but could not match the creaminess of other brands
coming to the outlet they hardly have 5 varieties  sadly had to choose one among them",3,
on time delivery very nice thank you,5,
timely delivery,5,
nutella brownie blast thick milk shake  i would rate this 45 because i was expecting some brownie piece in it i liked the taste  thickness was also perfect over all would suggest people to try this,5,
i had this ice cream tootyfruity it was so horrible there were pieces of something that were tasteless and they put so much nuts and other bullshit that the only thing that was okay the actual ice cream i could not have the taste of that too i literally puked the entire thing after having a severe stomach ache do not have tootyfruity unless it is just a scoop with no addons,1,
genrally i do not eat ice creams but have tried today brownie blast ice cream which was very good in taste you will find varities of ice creams  its very much pocket friendly  the delivery was also on time since i ordered online,4,
it is good,5,
its too good for nightcrawlers like us we enjoy it after getting high af also the delivery is pretty fast so thumbs upand would recommend to try it,5,

"this place is a savior for mid night cravings
i have tried the chocolate sundae brownie with ice cream and many basic flavours like mangobelgium chocolatechoco chip chocolatebutterscotch and strawberry

"awesome and wonderful place i had ordered frequently from this place and visited this place a lot times my top charts for icecreams were apsara cream stone and naturals after getting familiarized with this place this stood top among my top chart 

pros pocket friendly yet high quality ice creams delivered with dryice so delivery experience was good and it did not melt can visit for ice cream late night value proportion for money
cons having there is not that great as place is small",5,

on time great delivery,5,
"the staff was very ill mannered and have no respect towards customers 6 of us went there to dine in and ordered plenty one of our friends brought butter milk from the next store and sat along with us he could have told politely that outside food was not allowed but he asked him to get out in a mannerless way we cancelled the order and walked away

management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour or train their staff properly

profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality not the other way around

i wouldnt suggest a visit to this place if you are not ok with this kind of treatment",1,

not that tasty as expected,2,
very quick the delivery boy was,5,

"ordered hot chocolate brownie and nuts overload both were good but could have been better

"friday night must desserts
amul has an outlet near dlf cybercity gate 2 gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends this place is small and has less number of tables available it is decorated with the lights and the loud music plays in the background people love to enjoy desserts here after having the street food at dlf
they serve a large variety of ice creams brownies sundae etc we ordered belgian chocolate rajbhog and kesar pista ice creams cost near inr 75 all of them were delicious and mouth watering service was quite slow as they had many online orders in a queue
overall 
a casual place to on every weekend for the desserts along with the friends",4,

one order was supposed to be a thick shake but it came out to be ice cream dissatisfied  serving below standard food late night,1,
they did not send the food packaging in their regular amul branded covers,4,
"i have ordered almost all the chocolate concept ice creams from the menu and needless to say i was never disappointedi have also tried fresh fruit  concepts nutty concepts  and the scoop ice creams toomy personal favourite from the list is death by chocolate and nuts overloaded sundae
should definitely try thisthe home delivery experience and packaging is awesome",5,
without any doubt this is the the best place to order the quality and quantity are at its best which makes most people addicted to it a treat to tounge and tummy,5,

starters was ok to taste but after effect lasted for days the colour of the stools was black for almost 5 days from the day we visited that place my friends experience after having those starters was horribleshe was admitted in hospital,1,
"the biggest screen in town with a lovely rooftop but portion size and value for money takes a dip they have different rules on zomato gold or dineout pricy too ",4,
the name resembles this place with their pricesskyhyvery bad experience worst food worst service we ordered spicy grill chicken we could not differentiate whether it was chicken or some other cheap meat the fish fingers were oily as hyderabad is summer sweat  i would rate 05 for this place,1,
"i have been to this place with my friends on a friday evening as they had bollywood night starting from 8
the food was average they did not even had breezer which is disappointing the service was not that great
as mentioned earlier they has bollywood night which did not even start till 10pm

i visited this place on friday but i do not like food and service provided i ordered barbecue chicken but it was not cooked properly but i liked the ambiance and open terrace,3,
i have been to this restaurant to see my friend the place is well situated on the main gachibowli road near by the flyover ambience was nice and the taste of food is good too we order a cheese balls in the started and a veg sizzlers sizzler was amazing and sumptuous recommend this place to visit once at least,4,
"been here a lot of times and it is a place to go to when weather is nice as its in the open
food is good and menu has decent choices
dance floor is limited to couples though or you have to have at least a girl in your group to enjoy dancing",4,
this place is awesome to hangout with friends i liked the dance floor and the way they serve the food and been polite with customer but food was average need to improve in that a little,3,
"again i was in dilemma between 3 to 4 place is good and nice terrace but it is very very small the night will purely depends on band playing that night all regular options of menu available food is ok and nothing special with drinks but a good evening can be passed through
ok kind of for your money as i am comparing other places in same area",3,
if there z an option to give 0 i certainly do that disgusting food ordered multiple option thinking at least this one should be fine but none of the dishes are promising not even close to basic taste avoid this pub nothing means nothing in food and price range is not lessif u dare to go after looking into this review no one can not stop u  worst experience ever had,1,
been there on a saturday night and the atmosphere was electrifying this place has a nice rooftop sitting area and also a dance floor excellent service,5,
"one of good open terase place in town

food was good mood uplifting dance floor

to hangout with friends it is a great place to visit ",4,
been there with friends they took 2 hours to get a starter no lights and he refused to turn on lights regret visiting this place  i will not go there again,1,
the worst behaviour of staff we are seating on rooftop and went to dance floor leaving our belongings at our table and one stuart comes and asks us credit card as deposit what kind of service is this in last 12 years i have visited 100s of pubs in india no one asked such dear skyhy if u think u r one of top pub listen there are more which give better service than you,1,
"the most happing place for me multiple visits because of their terrace seating and large screen
multiple match is i watched here with my friends
as compared to multiple places in hyd it is bit costly but worth it",5,
"wanderfull place nice hospitality
amazing dance floor
good food
friendly staff
i really enjoy
skyhy is one of the best pub in hyderabad
i love this place",5,
"awesome place for couples to visit not so loud just if u wanna have a romantic date and chitchat with ur partner in dim lights with not so disturbing crowd this is the perfect destination

the food they serve is awesome specially jalapeno cheese poppers and best thing live sport screening if you are a fan",4,

management and waiters are good in service becoz we went in weekday so did not had any problems one best thing to watch cricket on screen on terrace
at last had a great time with friends",3,
worst place to be on a saturday evening service was slow and there were hardly 3 tables with close to 30people in the whole of skyhy two people were serving and 5 waiters were busy watching ipl this was my first visit and for sure the last visit i would not even give 1 start but had no other options,1,
"dj floor is the best part of skyhy 
the name of the lounge is justified with a decent rooftop
ipl and t20 times are the best to visit this place
although the food and drinks quality need to be improved on a little as we had bad experiences for couple of visits",3,
had the long island and the salsa nachos bothered excellent the nachos were delicious with a smoked after taste which was fantastic the music and ambiance was on point and honestly first place iv seen who provielde sugar cane stick as a sterer it is a genius idea good to chew on when you wait for your food but more than anything it was the manager of the outlet who took the cake in terms of service stand up chap props to him,4,
"well went to this place on a ladies night so drinks were on house yayy for that 
all we had to buy was starters which were really good the ambience is good not sure about the rooftop as we did not land there good dj good service
i am saying good at every sentence cause it was not exceptional even though it was a pretty decent club
would suggest to go check out for once ",4,
i prefer outdoor music is good perfect for out dine with friend and can enjoy live match if you like choose wisely from menu  food drink is fine,4,
the best place to have fun and hang out with frind for a drinks  bar tender silu awesome make cocktail anf shoot food also good snd service,5,
"worst service kept us waiting for food but did not had the courtesy to inform after waiting for almost an hour we had to cancel management is very incompetent name of manager umakant
disappointed

worst experience",1,
pathetic unprofessional staff bouncers will make you wait for 1520 mins at the entrance even if you have made an advance booking for office party moreover they ask to call any member from your group who is already in to verify whether booking is done or not party is going on or not if it was my personal party i would have immediately cancelled the booking and have gone somewhere else,1,
they do not have any options they have an elaborate menu but have very few options available waste of going there service was not good too cocktails were costly but they do not taste good at all,1,
"very overpriced diluted drinks on complaining the bartender said it has very high alcohol content blah blah and we do not know how the cocktails are made very arrogant and rude staff the order took forever to come not sure if this is a saturday night rush issue or a regular thing 
when our order finally arrived they got it wrong
the dance floor was very crowded and some people were pushing us

the only good part was 22 with zomato gold

in the final bill they charged us for 6 extra drinks and refused to update bill
if you are a party of 45 people please avoid this place",1,
"i went there on sat night with my friends to have a fun weekend the place was lit  ambience was amazing  they have a rooftop arrangemnt where u can sit and njoy ur drinks and then be ready to move those feets with the cool dj 
we ordered a couple of whiskey  beer one cocktail named cosmopolitian and a mocktail
the dj shut down at around 1230 to 1 am 
overall i had a blast and the place is really cool for all those who love to party",4,
"ok place for casual hangouts

food was not so great it was ok ok there werent many options for drinks as well service was also not so great i would say",2,
"i had been to this place last weekend with family i must say the service is excellent coming to the ambience the dance floor and the area beside that looks great but the rooftop was not that interesting 1 less star only for that but other than that the food was good but not that great we ordered
1 budweiser 3
2 virgin mojito 2  it was soooooo good
3 chicken tikka  could have cooked more
4 crispy chicken asian style
5 dragon chicken
6 chicken pulao  same as biryani nothing great

overall i feel a little more work to be put into deco on the rooftop  a little on food but a good open air experience best if you come as a couple the dance floor will be open to you",3,
pitchers and towers are not availablebut they are present in the menuwe have ordered chicken wingsthey are not hot and even chicken is smelling foul and is not freshhighly dissapointeddont know what management is doing,1,
"went there for an office party
the dj was so bad he did not play any requested songs
he mixed all the songs which did not set the mood right and ruined all the trippy songs by making them fast and adding beats eg for manali trance he made it fast totally ruined the mood of the crowd did not play as we requested even though we had bookd the place horrible",1,
came for office party food is just okay they have dance floor also ambiance is okay not very great maybe top floor have better ambiance overall ok ok place,3,
pub was superbrooftop great ambiance good music  dance floor but food was okmost of the popular drinks was not available  overall good,3,

service must be improved as i did not found any one to guide or receive when i entered 1230pm",3,
cocktails are awesome great ambience food is good fish starters are tasty i seated at rooftop nice place to hang out with friends and colleagues,5,
ambience in here is nice it is my go get hangout place and sure about food it is good  good for casual and team especially when there is a match coz it is got a big screen with open roof top space,3,
i been to this with my office colleagues everything is seems perfect expect the dj in this bar they need to improve on this asap drinks are little expensive,3,
food is horrible  cost both bar and food  are too costly and the taste of food do not justify the pricebut ambiance is okay  music is nice  good place for drinking but food  ah ah no,3,
its a great place to visit with a couple of friends for some drinks and food the staff is very cooperative and helpful the crowd is okay the ambience is the thing i liked the most an open terrace option just adds up to the charm of the night all in all its among the best places in hyderabad to have food and drinks so let the drinks pour in cheers,5,
"been here couple of times on weekdays it has both open area and closed area too the ambience was nice the quality of food is ok okdj was good the service was fine but you are not valued if you are going as a stag after spending some time felt its too cold outside so asked if i can go to closed area but they refused even after requesting which made me to leave the place earlier

"went to skyhy with great expectations but pathetic service and very bad food qualitywasted almost 1hr for food to arrive and they served the wrong item

very disappointedwill not prefer to return again",1,
"ambience and dance floor are primary attractions at the restaurant
zomato coupons are pretty well acknowledged
drinks are really worth with zomato inclusion
both veg  nonveg starters are delicious
worth for the money",5,
place is nice  it has open area on terrace and closed area too have been here twice and found that the service is nice but the quality of food is not that great dj was good and once out of 2 times have experienced power cut and the team was not able to have the backup for 30mins but this might be a one off case so should be fine its an average place to be there,3,
chilled out place for office party went at 6pm and place was super quiet if you have good company and want to have relaxed drinking experience go before 7 pm zomato gold works well you can pay using dineout app staff is super cool,5,
"non veg was not good at all ordered fish chicken wings both were vry bad
veg was good though ordered chilly mushroom and crispy corn chill mushroom ws exceptionally good",3,
worst place went soo far do not believe in pictures quality of food is worst dj was very very very bad disgusting place seen in zomato impressed with pictures but came to a worst place,1,

but when it comes to serving the boys are very slow need to improve",4,
"food  4
ambiance  4

pocket pinch  around 9k for 9 people with 6 zomato golds and around 15 starters

i went in a group of 9 people on a thursday night and the place was pretty empty they were playing nice funky music and the ambiance was really nice the service was fine like any other party place had and the taste of food was also decent even though we were 9 people they allowed us to use 6 zomato golds and i really appreciate it

the corn and cheese triangles were awesome
the food was served really hot and the place would be fun when there is right crowd

overall a good experience",4,
"the best hangouts place with friends and girlfriend and it had good dance floor i got good variety of liquor brands also but the food is main concern in terms of both taste and quantityfor quires contact sujithreddy12 in instagram
skyhy",3,
went with friends here the food is really good went on to the dance floor and it was a nice experience the view from the roof is really nice,5,
"they did not allow entry at 1107pm today just saying that they allow till 11pm why then it is mentioned that we can enjoy till 1 am  that too on saturday ",1,
"food was mediocre and had to wait an hour just to get the starters a rooftop devoid of a view  only good thing about the place was the dance floor ",3,
whoever is a stag remember that you will not be allowed in 5th floor even though you have booked through zomatoand they recommend you to 4th floor masti sports barbad experiencei will not recommend this place to anyonestay away,1,
"good for group outings they provide rooftop seating arrangements
music can be better for the dance floor ambience is okay food is average good staff though they are helpful and friendly",3,
just because a bunch of corporate guys request for retro songs you shouldnt ignore the rest of the crowd please consider it serious food is ok,1,
amazing chef order anything in fish it will be utterly tasty i would call it a best place for ambience and music is perfect visited twice pretty descent crowd delay in service due to lack of staff headcount all it comes to your starving cz u need to wait for it never stop yourself to visit this place,4,
"delicious food with good quantity

yesterday was the first time we been there at sky hy it is a good place to spend some quality time with your friends and loved ones the food was great and delicious the place is not like a typical pub where in you can get drunk and have good food but it is more like a place wherein you can chit chat and hang over coming to the food we had paneer tikka chicken majestic and chicken tikka pizza which are execellent in taste they are delicious",4,
been here on a saturday evening the service looked a bit slow but the food tasted good they allow stags without any cover charge but they do not let you enter the dance floor if you are one the staff is also very cooperative go here as a crowd and you would love it,3,
"good place for a open air n music with nice barmans special drinks
nice music and dance accordingly basis your crowd must try on barmans special",4,
great ambience and perfect roof top bar good service and decent variety of liquor and super pocket friendly must visit to unwind the food what ever i ordered was ok no complaints visit here to unwind one suggestion pls change the live band if the original artists hear them they will all kill them selves,4,

please do not forget to visit this place if u re in gachibowli for the most happening nigh
this please will never disappoints you",5,
"this place has amazing setup separated in multiple sections so one can have romantic dates casual hangouts dj dance parties
i love the interior n decor of the place it looks quite classy they can do it bit better though
there are multiple events going on this place make it more interesting the dance floor is big and closed to give u the thumping sound there is a huge screen for live matches

food i have loved the food here be it veg or non veg fish is quite good the masala level is decent liquor collection is good but i do not find cocktails much interesting here

value for money the price is pretty decent compared to the peer pubs food menu is very reasonable

the service is good front desk receptionists are helpful in getting you a seat",4,
"everything one needs seating at fully friendly bar man sillu thank u for your service n drink

biggest place gachiwali area n quality of food was delicious we really testy and service is very fast  overall 5 to 5 we definitely recommende",5,
was there for dinner on a weekday the ambience is sombre they have a wide variety of menu ranging from european to chinese to hyderabadi biryanis tried the virgin guava mary mocktailwhich was really good the chicken quesadillas were delicious we also had spicy chicken sizzlers which was also good had an overall good experience,3,
"i will not be here next time if mr umakant is not here next time super service and awesome place great staff had an awesome time

love this place",5,
"it was an awesome experience umakant
is gem of a person he makes sure that you leave the place with great memories the music and food is really good dal makhani and nachos are must try",5,
"courteous staff good food and lovely vibes
sahoo was a lovely company for the night
sunday is ladies night and live band for your information
monday is all alcohol on mrp",5,
this place is okay at best the drinks are too diluted with an extra crapload of ice the live music was really great but did not fit inside such a place cibo house is a much better place if you are looking for some good live music a peaceful time and some great drinks with friends,2,
i have been hearing some really good reviews about this  place the ambience is  happeningon a lucky sunday night you get to hear live band too,5,
very bad place to hang on the staff is very arrogant and short tempered they do not allow entry to stags on the dance floor also and despite of so high prices have not given any discount even not corporate discount too,1,
do not ever go to this place waste of money if you give order the order will come after 45 mins behaviour of the staff is horrible the partnerowner even do not know about how to behave to customer,1,
skyhy is a good place to hang out with friends nice place  nice food  good staff entire the skyh friendlly thanks monaranj is a vry gd guy,5,

nice ambience great service by sahu bhaiya there is no more hookah service though  but the place is great and less crowded even on weekends,4,
nice place to hang out with friends it has live cricket screening quite big screen food orders are served within 10 mins quite quick good ambience good service it is a place to revisit,5,
firstly the pictures that they have put up makes this place looks brightly light but it is kind of dark and the ambiance is not exactly as portrayed not very crowded which makes it spacious enough food is okay but the service was pathetic when asked for spoons the waiter asked us to use the serving spoon instead there was a lot of delay in service and mismanagement,2,
"the staff is professional and courteous a shout out to
sahoo for the excellent service
great ambience with good food
a really nice experience",5,

the place is really nice devashish helped us in all best way i would love to go ther more often since the staff and the place is really nice,4,
"tldr  an avg place with  moderately expensive drinks   a lit in pictures at 550   a nice club with good ambiance  but they closed the roof top due to less crowd on a saturday night  it was a happening place earlier  which could not cope up with new upcoming competition around it  the chicken wings were undercooked  the only good thing about the place was the energetic dj with crazy numbers  the dance floor  the staff were not friendly because they tried to stop me  another blogger from taking pictures  videos of the place multiple times after even mentioning that we were lifetstylefood bloggers maybe they might have had a misconception initially  ",2,
"just do not go by rating

it is an awesome experience

umakant is just awesomeserved to the satisfaction of 16 guys

music is too cool

party was just grrreaaaaattt",5,
nice place good location descent ambience and very good service by sahoo had a descent time with friends will surely come back again,4,
having a great time and excellent service by saboo this place is a must excellent drinks and very good pizza come join us some time see you there,5,
a very bad experience i went here with my team but the staff made sure that we had the worst experience the food was cold served very late drinks were of bad quality staff behavior was also very bad,1,
everything since i entered the restaurant was a disaster i received cold food after 45 minutes after i placed the order that too after multiple complaints the drinks quality was not good it happened twice that the staff forgot the order after we placed it they had to be reminded about the order overall very bad experience regarding food quality drinks quality and service would not recommend to visit,1,
"the place is really nice and they make amazing cocktails  they are awesome  they have really tasty starters esp their jalapeo cheese balls 

do not know if they still allow stags  they used to let us in when it opened new at gachibowli

food  55
drinks  455
ambience  355

price  totally worth it",4,
"we came at this restaurant for a drink on a weekday at it did not disappoint music was good we ordered a pizza garlic bread and beers pizza was the best i have ever had but garlic bread was disappointing also we had a couple of beers and we ordered a couple more they were unopened we changed our mind and asked the waiter to exchange them with coke which was refused i did not understand the waiter is logic and i did not argue also apart from beer everything is costly here i am going for a 3 out 5 for this restaurant
ps this restaurant serves the best pizza in hyderabad",3,
lovely place to hangout with friends surely one of my favourite placeramakanth working here had always been helpful and prompt at servicekeep it up,5,
"a cool place to hang out with friends ambience deserves a special mention as it is cool great music and dj and chilled out crowd
food is good ",4,
"last night spent at tiki shack for a quick round of drinks as we reached it started raining giving some respite from the heat and we could enjoy the lovely terrace ambience

watermelon martini for me and bacardi for my better half with some pork spare ribs was our order martini was well made to my liking the ribs had only one rib and rest were chunky pieces which we pointed out but it was well made in spicy siracha sauce which kind of compensated

overall a nice place with ample seating though music is on the louder side the only let down was the plastic cutlery which you wouldnt expect here",4,
delicious food and decent crowd roof top was unbearable because of heat so had to shift inside since music was bit louder inside bought some whiskey and went home overall okayshh,3,
everything about this place sound good  with great ambiance and decent food and drink options  i would recommend this place only if you are going as a couple or girls  they have a huge gender discrimination for guys as they need to pay higher cover charges on weekends than the bill they would sum up  world and tikki shack will be a better place if they stop discriminations and spread equality,2,
party  great place to party and in indira nagar they have rooftop arrangements and good space to dance and enjoy very decent and classy crowd good place to chill at weekend,4,
a cool place to for casual hangout is do not expect a crowd on weekdays but weekends it is good good food good ambience service could a little faster but it is fine as the music compensates it,4,
this is not a good place for food as there are no good options also the staff does not feel like working when the customers are around they need to improve,1,
"the place was good ambiance was very nice music was amazing
the issue was with orders it literally took ages get an order after lots of struggle i know it was crowded and everyone was placing orders but they should also have strength to complete it as they know about the crowd
wash room must be repaired",4,
"the desi pub with the beach theme they have both the indoor and outdoor seating but they usually provide only the outdoor seating as they keep their indoor seating mostly reserved you might reserve and still end up sitting outside the food was also good the customer service is something that needs to be improved
top picks 
chilly prawns
cheesy fries

the chilly prawns is a must try the mocktails were okay not much varieties when it comes to mocktails overall a great place to hangout",4,
"ambience and location is nice but nice to hangouts only in group and a girl is mandatory to be in group else entry will be denied thumbs down for stag starters are good but main course is really horrible very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking the staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders you can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full the complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority
you might see lot of positive feedbacks but most of them are done just to get a free ice cream yes they offer free ice cream if you write good reviews for them luckily i do not like vanilla flavour so will write what i felt",2,
"good place to go around
ambience is good and crowd is good over weekends
food was not that good which i thought of
must try jalepeno cheese poppers
ambience 45
food35
seevice 355",3,
amazing place to hang around nice ambiencefood and amazing service thanks to najibul he is a perfect host to take care of the guestshighly recommended for an memorable evening,5,
i had visited this pub on a saturday night with my office comrades i must say they have a nice rooftop setup and must mention the awesome live dj the place is one fire  after 930 you will see a lot of guys and the place is almost packed we had customized a packaged deal for rs 1800 per person which includes jw black label and grey goose unlimited starters and desserts towards the end really a good deal in terms of the offering veg starters panner tikka manchurian and cheese cutlet was really good the only con was the slow service over here,4,
this is one of party hubs of hyderabad initially somehow i did not like it but after 2 or 3 visits the place grew on me we now frequent the place for the mahol of the place ambience is pretty cool and nice crowd as well,4,
"never give a 2nd thought if u hear tiki shacksuch a fun filled place wid lovely music nd amazing starters  wanna visit dis place again n again the dhol is the attention of all ",5,
overrated i do not know why stag entry is not allowed there no crowd okay okay ambience service is slow and if you are using zomato gold they will say that they do not have kingfisher premium kingfisher ultra and draught beer,3,
i went on a ladies night they have really good cocktails food is good but i felt the quantity was less ambience and music is good  service is good,3,
tiki shack was a complete surprise package when my colleague lead us through the shady stairs and a rumbling lift to tiki shack i was not expecting much but to my surprise they had a great menu and the food was amazing the pizzas were light and tasty and all the starters were quite good by 10pm the ambience was quite electric and we had a great time,5,
loved live music and dj can enloy a lot by live music ambience was good and awesome rooftop was super cool we can chill more happily by rooftop tastes are good,4,
"been here on friday evening staff and service was very prompt
liit is very good here must try if you like a strong drink
food was not so great",4,
"the only thing i liked about this place is there ambience it was good other than that everything was just average or below average
the service at this place is pathetic  we had to call the waiters several time for one small thing also 
it was a pub with no dance floor people had to manage with whatever place they were getting
the place is known for its beach view but as we went on weekday could not see that
food ofcourse no one should expect anything with the food we get in pubs  it was not good here as well
overall it was not a very good experience at this place",2,
i had been with a friend on a weekday when the place was not much crowded all we had are pizzas and drinks the best part is you can customize your pizza did not cost us a lot so would say it is reasonable particularly loved the ambience we sat in the terrace area which was beautiful the service is a little slow but we did not mind waiting,4,
"tiki shack near jubilee check post was one of my favorites and that is the graar vibe it carries gachhibowli one is never like that but undoubtedly a good place to hang on lit will have a special mention in both the places though
little costly and ya inside they would have some restrictions with stags and couple
your wallet would feel happy if you are going as couple or gang",3,
"yes tiki shack my most loving pub in the city been visitied this place multiple times never ever got disappointed with this place ambiance food and the service special thanks to u buddy deepak ",5,

had starters and cocktails waiters are not even ready to tell the menu properly",1,
very poor service i went in day time and took 40 min to serve nachos food taste very poor i could rate this place ve they have speciality to server hot beer there staff is not entertaining,1,
the place is just the same as they have in jubilee hills the waiting staff is humble and the ambience says the rest a must visit if you are in gachibowli and need a place to chill,4,
"great ambience and music good service even though a crowded club nice rooftop as well as interiors had a good time would recommend one visit
chili guava martini is really chilli no kidding",4,
hi  though i love the place  the service offered was pathetic to say the least the restaurant did not offer the gold privilege saying they do not offer it on weekends  later during exit when i checked with the manager he said there is no such thing  but we were already billed til then  our serving staff also asked us to pay via google pay without bill so please beware of these things when you are you are at the restaurant,1,
"visited this place twice and it is completely lit
the ambience and the crowd both will amaze you
music is also nice and will make the non dancers groove too
food is amazing and budget friendly 
try to choose rooftop sitting
one of the hippie place in hyderabad fro fridays and saturdays",4,
pathetic and rude staff slowest service they had tables free at terrace and at lower floor but still they say that its full so that there upper floor gets full first which is not good will never visit again,1,
"nice ambience to enjoy the night
food is not that great
but their alcohol section is decent
service is fantastic and the waiters and staff are really kind",4,
i visited this place with my friendsthe food was very nicegood place to hangout with friendsits a must visit place with an open top bar in the evening hours,5,
"this one is bigger than the jubilee hills one and surely got good space which is a great thing as the previous one gets so cringy we went on a ladies night but the sad part it goes only from 8 to 10 pm and most of the girls where not even there anyway the starters are quite price competitive and tasty we had veg spring rolls veg manchurian and chicken balls all were great and i have ordered long island iced tea which they made perfect

on wednesdays they have a guest dj maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house dj akso is great too

all the best guyskeep rocking

"looking for a place filled with crazy people with affordable drinks and upbeat music tiki shack is the place for you located on roof top in indra nagar  you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded gachibowlli and hitech city the place is dimly lit but i guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time the dj plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway the staff is courteous and prompt  despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends the food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time i have visited this place 34 times and have never been disappointed go in with your friends on a weekend for an affordable menu and feet tapping music
keep up the good work tiki shack",5,
"good ambience and good atmosphere
finger food is good
a party place basically open area section is very cool
try crispy corn or nachos here cocktails are above average too",4,
"visited the gachibowli branch of tiki shak on a sunday evening
the place is very well placed in a very accessible area of gachibowli
it is a rooftop bar hence the ambience was pretty amazing they have nicely set up indoor and outdoor seating areas

we ordered 

jalapeno cheese poppers  45  yummy cheese filled balls with right amount of spices and jalapenos

aloo pakode  355  pretty normal with a homely taste to it

overall it was a good experience the place also offers 22 on drinks which can also be used on mocktails  just in case you are not a fan of alcohol ",4,
sudhanshu has been a great host loved his service will come back only coz of him lovely service good food loved it thank you so much,5,

ambiance was super cool  amazing",5,
"food is decent nothing out of the world yet i am giving this place a 5 stars
good finger food nothing you complain about but the vibe of the place post 10pm is just electrifying the highlight is the desi dhol beats total paisa vasool place they do not really have a dance floor but the vibe is so great that every inch which does not have a table become a dance floor lastly the decor is very pretty as well if you want to party cheap and have a blast this is the place for you",5,
"we visited the place on thursday night after calling up to do the booking for 3 stag entry we got the response over the phone that we can just walk in at 7pm as soon as i entered the first response from a person nikhil at the front desk was stag not allowed when i showed my phone and explained that i did call to do the booking he said no i was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table it was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior if you do not want to allow stag say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter do not change your rules according to your convenience grow up ",1,

shitfit  so happy its thursday cuz friday is tomorrow

while we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out i would like to share my recent experience with tiki shack  rooftop bar gachibowli where i have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning  such a pulsating dcor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks this place can accommodate up to 200300 pax both sitting and standing crowd unlike many places around gachibowli tikki shack has got reasonable pricing cost for 2 at 8001000inr including alcohol which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place no separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be after a while when the spirits go high

we negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 2025 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior noticereservation priced at 1100 per person allinclusive has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly the menu includes unlimited 3 veg and nonveg starters 1 veg and nonveg pizza 1 veg and nonveg biryani 2 desserts three varieties of mocktails for teetotalers draught beerkingfisher ultrapremium for people who drink with least expectation food esp starters turned out to be outstanding full house and the service was still attentive needs a special mention

overall a satisfactory experience and i would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties

kindly bare with the poor photography

"we came for just a couple of beers jger and baileys ordered for 8 baileys shots first and they tasted funny for some reason and when we asked for more after clarifying about the taste they mentioned that it is out of stock it so happens that jger glenfidditch is out of stock too

food was up to the mark",2,
"i have been to this place twice my first experience was not that great as i found the food items to be subpar so i quickly went to a different place after 2 months i recently went again for an office party with 40 people and it turned out to be a better experience starters chilli chicken fries cheese poppers some fish were fine but nothing extraordinary ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here  there dj was average biryani was good i heard but did not try it myself pizza was a big let down both in taste  presentation it was served cut into small rectangular pieces service was decent staff courteous good interiors
overall  35 considering the prices recommended for group drinking sessions maybe a bit of dancing too",4,
no dance floor and dj was not such good  need to improve dj system and good players to be placed and no stock in alcohol what ever we wish to oder sorry not available,3,
we celebrated the a friends bday and it was good the dj was average at that time which was a little mood killing but the food and drinks are good the bday boy almost passed out as we gifted him the helmet pop after which i dont think he remembers the next 24 hours,4,
"spent an amazing saturday night there
great service
ambience is really good
and food is okayish but the vibe makes up for it
would definitely recommend",4,
"the staff are not well trained they are non responsive had to wait for them to take the order even though there were only few table occupied and the food is also not worth the cutlery are not cleaned they had stains all over and felt like was at a local bar ",2,
i have been coming to this branch on a weekly basis off lately like from 4 weeks or so whenever i ask for the beer of my choicekf ultra or kf draught you guys just bluntly tell me that it is not available once i have asked karan directly and he told me that they would be available only during the weekdays i have visited this place today ie wednesday and it is the same story again i am forced to order heineken or bira the worst part was when i was about to push off after our hangout i have seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of draught beer and when i have asked they just ignored and did not even care to respond like really speaking on everyone is behalf it could be a budget constraint or someone is personal preference of beer but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and i am really disappointed this time well what can i say mustang is much betterthey offer everything in the menu i never expected that i would drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in hyd but i really can not help it this time work this out asap,1,
love the terrace sitting area the music and crowd is amaze and the ambience is lit even the nondancers will groove here the food quality quantity and taste everything is good the paneer pakora is the best ever i have tasted french fries are crispy from outside and soft from inside again one of the best chilli cheese toast was good,5,

i visited this place 2 days back with my frens hoping to have good time even though ambience and music was decent the service is extremely poor waiters are rude and behave as if they are doing some favor to u manager was also not helpful its high high time they improve their services if they want their customers to come back to them,1,
i visited tiki shack on a weekend afternoon and unexpectedly there was hardly any crowd only three tables were occupied then realized this place is so good but happening only in the evening oh btw those instagram famous tiki shack roof lights are lit only in the evening so yes the place i am sure looks much better and beautiful in the evenings  the food served here was too good we have ordered mostly finger food and everything we ordered tasted exceptionally good,4,
hi really disappointed with the service and staff was rude and not attentive at all seemed like all waiters were already high and had no clue wats going arnd them manager was also not very helpful but cant blame him with the dumb team u cant do much ambience is decent but the service is really really poor,1,

stag entry not allowed on a thursday night extremely disappointed it was a birthday of a friend and a group of 9 we said that we will confine ourselves to a secluded corner but were denied,1,
great place to hangout with friends been here for a party music was classy and ambience was more classy just hit the place and get sloshed,5,
they have different menu than mentioned in zomato they say menu is different on weekends and weekdays else place is ok to visit once they ask for identity proof for entry,1,
"my friends and i went here on a friday night around 830 and the place was pretty full and had good music interesting interiors  and overall great vibe
the service was a little slow but quite understandable given the crowd that kept pouring in till late in the night

food that we ordered  
1 masala peeenat   your normal peanuts with onions tomatoes and some spices decent munching

2 masala lijjat  this is masala papad with the same toppings as above so we did not quite enjoy it that much

3 bhej manchurian  veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing

4 jalapeno cheese poppers  unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i have tasted elsewhere these werent very dry and bland also good accompanying dip

5 aloo pakode  aloo bhajiyas loved them d

6  fries  good old classic salted fries 

the dj played some really great songs 
had a great time especially when they played the bollywood music and most people were on their feet",3,
food is good especially the taste but range is limited for main course they have a good dance area though not marked out and hinders the movement outside seating is decent and service is better,4,
"i will not recommend this place at alli visited this place today with 7 friends
we were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
after 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table meant for 5 pol max when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

i was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that i recommended this place

after 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table we started to leave and no one cared as if they do not even bother when i complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where i can accommodate my 7 friends

now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

many thanks for spoiling our friday night",1,
tiki is well known place for its best drinks and friendly staff u will always love the food here and the ambiance is just simple it is a beach look located at very right place easy to identify great week endssssssss,5,

 cheers guys",5,
"an awesome place to hang around with friends and family we love this place and it is the place to land in the week end not heavy on the pocket at all
we just love this place",5,
very bad behaviour of the staff no one took the order for 45 minutes when we asked the staff they were pointing at each other saying he will take order when we called the manager he was unnecessarily defending the staff saying they thought that table is for 4 other people must be joining sheer waste of time,1,
nice place for party good ambiance outside sitting is nice we went on wednesday for ladies night and had a great time tasty foodfriendly staff and great service,5,
the quality of food and drink was really good what turned out to be the biggest letdown was the service a few of the waiters are really ignorant they look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only with much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order after waiting for half an hour we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all we got a new waiter to whom we had to reiterate the whole thing although the new waiter was really polite and helpful but our experience was already ruined so my humble request is if you do not like to serve a smaller group mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant,3,
loved the service as well as the food especially the chicken salt and pepper loved it so much that i took 2 portions home as parcel the staff is also friendly must visit place,5,
amazing indoor and outdoor place to chill music is amazing go for safe choice of food selection which you are aware of i visit here all the time for music cool crowd gotta improve over food and cocktails drinks otherwise is good options two stars less coz they gotta improve over food,3,

ordered non veg nachos and i hardly found any non veg in it the pizza was quite bland too one of the really bad pepporoni pizza i have had in my life

"service was too slow waiters took some 20 minutes to realise we wanted to place an order
music was excessively loud and reached a point where the speakers could not support the playback without distorting the music
however the quality of liit was brilliant
i did not like food either",2,
"tiki shak gachibowli  hyderabad

the gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks chit chat and dance with my group

the place is only and solely for party animals completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating they have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables

the best time to go here is on friday night after work or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy plus there is live music by a dj live entertainment and wifi sodance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours feet

among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas regular margaritas beer to desi and angrezi whiskey if you want to try something different after work then do try their helmet pop for inr 980  which is an experience in itself this involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp

for food try their chilli cheese toast finger chips chilli chicken masala peanuts and spring rolls the prices are really pocket friendly

i went to the restaurant on friday night and have booked the table in the morning itself but manager denied and said i am giving you a favour for the table we had drinks but food was pathetic and one dish was replaced when the bill was paid and we have to leave it coming to the bill these guys have started charging some service charge which is illegal which will be forced on customers and they expect the customers to pay service charge in cash i am reporting this to local authorities as they have started booking other restaurants for these illegal things,1,
worst food order chilly corn and they gave us pakoda bad quality food ever better they suppose need to change the name to worst food we provide and,1,

very cool open roof restaurant that served great appetizers and booze good place to hangout with friends and located in the centre of hyderabad is it industries,4,
first they had some kind of rule like below 21yrs old i really respect that check so he asked for ids at the entrance we dint carry that but we had our soft copies so we showed thathowever one among 6of us was not having the soft copy we tried ensuring that our friend was 30yrs old but he dint believe and after lot many arguments finally we were allowed to enter people are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptablethen comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itselfthere were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested i think to attend peoplethere are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast next food was okayishthe only good thing was the ambiencethe washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like have not been cleaned up since longwill not recommend anyone to visit and i personally wouldnt visit the place again,1,
this place closes by 12 and the food is is quantity but it closes earlier then expected what should be done in this case it shares wrong information,3,

"i am giving 3 star out of 5 to mustang just for roof top ambience where i was able to drink in between the glowing city lights  restaurant should work on customer service more ",3,
"never thought the place is that lit purely under rated staff is super friendly and they will not have nonsense rules for stags too very much happening too good ambiance with nice terrace
need to be little early for draught
great value for money",5,
"if you go to mustang you should sit on the terrace otherwise it is not worth it
the place has good service too the servers are helpful
mustang has zomato gold so that is an added incentive to go
we ordered nachos which was a big disappointment because either they were not baked properly or they were old they tasted weird
fir veg pizzas their options are not that great so we ended up orsering the greek pizza twice but dint regret it even a bit the greek pizza is the safest and the best bet in their menu",4,
this pub is located at the heart of the hitech city it is a rooftop bar with a pleasant view nothing very extraordinary about the place food is about average mostly the office crowd keeps pouring in live streams the ipl match in big screen it mostly remains crowded and yes the music is bollywood,3,
been there on a friday night and loved the ambience place was not too much crowded  music and dj was good and also the food this place is situated in a good location convenient for people working in gachibowli we ordered liit and it was amazing must visit,5,
great selection of drinks but most of the options on the menu were not actually available which was a bit disappointing the limited options that were available including pizzas and burritos were very good,3,
such a nice place at gachibowli hang out with friends and as a couple  also enjoyed the dance floor with good music food was okies type but has a lot of options ambience is also good,4,
an wxtra star for dance floor waahaaaa whatta a night it was a great dance floor and friendly dj it was a night i can not forget food yum manchurian noodles pasta pizza were great would nt mind going again,4,
"best rooftop restaurant in gachibowli
great food good service made my dayi like chicken biryani very much here do visit this place",5,
definitely will not go again had gone with my friends for lunch and the waiters were shabby and drunk at service we could not wait to get out of the place,1,
"this place has quite a ambience to visit for 
but that is all you will get at this place
they have just two attendant in total to take your order and service time is very poor i almost forgot i ordered something
the taste is not worth the wait and the dj makes it even more worse by his songs
ambience 
food

service ",2,
on my visit at a pleasant evening to the restaurant i ordered cosmopolitan drink while my friends beer came right away they took almost an hour to get my drink after that day i got some infection in my throat which i ignored for few days and it got worse the doctor at apollo told me that it is a severe bacterial infection and i had to take antibiotic injection twice along with other medication followed by various tests although everything about the restaurant was nice but not sure what went wrong with that drink in particular which ended me in a hospital,1,
"well going step by step

ambience is pretty good 4 for that
location is accessible 3 for that
service is okay too 3 for that
food was okay not something out of the blue but yes it was reasonable so 3 for that too

overall 1 for poor post order served service i had asked for leman about 7 times before i reached out to manager for lemons

same drill happened twice on same day while being on same table

recommended for drinks and ambiance but heyy do not rely in their service",1,
"located in one of the prime locations of hyderabad mustang terrace lounge has an american cowboy theme with some really good ambience providing both indoor and outdoor seating the outdoor seating has an amazing view of the city especially at night time
food is average to be honest the french fries and nachos items could have been way better chicken tikka pizza was pretty bland chilli fish was really good though
my friends had sex on the beach cocktail and i had virgin mojito mocktail and i must say both of them were amazing i had the mint cooler too and i liked virgin mojito better definitely worth a try
the place has zomto gold on drinks which is great for people who would like to drink overall it was a pretty good experience at this place with some decent food and the ipl screening",4,
"i went to this place for dinner
i like the roof top view it had and the ambience was good i orderd for couple of shots with cosmopolitan cocktail and a potato fry with garlic curry leaves and chilly flakes fried in olive oil and it was yummy served with maiones dip
i somehow felt that the service needs to be improved and here is my overall rating out of 5
ambience 42
cocktail 38
food 4
service 3",4,
food drinks and music all is good what this place lacks is in service the servers literally forgot us and we had to call them multiple times and remind them to take our orders the ambience is great the view is superb they have 3 sitting areas indoor and two terrace sitting,3,
"one of the better and smaller roof top places in hyderabad it would hardly have about 8 tables on the rooftop which makes me like this place it is quite cosy and they play some good music there are also 2 exclusive places on the rooftop one which is like one tiny table on an elevation and another like an enclosed area

we asked for cheese balls fish tava chicken 65 and margarita pizza all these items were good nothing exceptional but just about right recommend yes must visit maybe not",4,
horrible service food is below average staff is extremely rude including the manager ambience is the only good thing if i had an option i would have given a negative star rating this place just spoilt my friday night mood,1,
"already been to this place twice absolutely love the rooftop and the food it is really windy up there and has a great ambiance would highly recommend for a date or for hanging out with friends
the only problem is the service is pretty slow which is probably because there is not enough staff
otherwise no complaints at all",4,
it is one of the worst places to be in during the week the manager is extremely unfriendly and rude the music sucks and the food and service is worth abhorrence,1,
"pathetic plac i would never suggest anyone to go here
poor service and the waiters have literally no manners at all
overall a very bad experience",1,
amazing ambience with amazing spicy chicken table and chicken 65 which is must tryamazing food with amazing ambiencereally enjoyed a lot with friends and company,5,
good place with nice ambience we ordered a paneer pizza and nachos pizza was really good the staff was polite and food was served very fast,4,
a very nice place with good roof top had an amazing time and they have some good cocktails great staff especially our server indian cowboy,5,
trust it will surely make your innerself more happy one of the best roof top lounges with such a pleasant ambience good food and quick service nd only complaint is there was no music they said they have a problem with the socket but still it is okay i will surely visit again,5,
"worst service and behaviour is extremely rude and unprofessional by d staffs as well as manager
manager is short tempered and unsocial i ll never suggest for this pub",1,
"great ambience it is very windy when you sit at the top most table and it has great view service is average and food is also average went there on friday in a group of 10 people we ordered many dishes but the quality was average since we were sitting at the top service was also average
ambience 45
food  255
service 35
overall 35",3,
we have been to this place as an office team outing in the afternoon they let us play dj for ourselves though it was afternoon we had lots of fun and had a great time the place was very nice and food as well thanks,4,
the ambience is good but please check the bill before paying they charge 10 service charge without asking you which is illegal please do not pay service charge ask them to remove it if you find it on the bill thanks,3,
the place i have visited many times made me sad by the last visit because most of the tables they kept on reserved though during staying there till 1030pm we have not seen anyone to come and occupy the seats the starters items are extremely costly and very less in quantity only reason of visiting the place is roof top otherwise it is one of the most expensive places to visit in gachibowli area,3,
"these guys are awesome balram diven and jagan thanks for the hospitality guys keep up your good job all the cocktails were good specially the inhouse ones thanks ",5,
one of the best roof tops around and is pocket friendly with delicious food their service is good they got good music going they have wide variety of cocktails and mocktails to choose a nice place to hangout in the evening with your friends and loved ones,4,
this is worst place in gachibowli let me tell you wat happened as soon as we came in bar worker suggested to sit near corner its was kind washroom near when whole bar was empty on friday night as i gave full mouth full to bar workers as insulted guests by asking them sit in corner as if we are cheap i gave him wat he deserves i sincerely suggest ppl not to go,1,
i liked the ambience however i feel there is a scope for improvement in the drink selection and food the taste for authentic indian cuisine is maintained,4,
a classic place in gachibowli ambience food drinks everything is up to the mark if you want to have some chill time with friends just opt for this one being a vegetarian i could find the good starters over there,5,
the best place for food guys i have tried so many food items here trust me you will enjoy the food here and the ambience give you a vintage look all over you will enjoy the place and evenings the bollywood dj night will make you to step on the dance floor and make some moves,5,
"went to this place on a friday evening and trust me i was pleasantly surprised was the first time i was visiting with a group of 7 and we had made reservations and as we entered they politely showed us our seats and it looked luxurious af the food was brought fast and it tasted really good
we ordered cheese balls chicken wings chicken manchurian chilli paneer and bbq pizza the pizza was not great but everything else was delicious
the staff is friendly and though they were a little confused with our order for flavoured shots they were very patient and bought us exactly what we are desired for and treated us really well 
i am going to have to tell you that we are definitely putting mustang lounge into our book mark places and will be visiting soon",5,
very bad management is worst than whatever i visited till now since i was giving 1 start he started scolding me and threatening me i am totally disappointed,1,
nice place to visit at evenings visited a long time ago friendly staff and the food was great if you want to spend some peaceful time with your loved once give a try,4,
"best rooftop place in hyderabad
dj was playing best songs playing with the people
nice place to enjoy your weekend
overall i am happy with the service and place
would recommend this to all my friends",5,
"yes mustang is a great loungejust went in the late evening just want to kill some time there that all used zomato gold they do accept it well and they dont have fosters and kf premium are not available we order kf ultra and a while later he bought budweiser as the idea is to kill time so we just had the beer what we have they given

service  3
rest all u can mark as 4",3,
"best place in the town visited this place with my colleagues last weekend apt service heart food make this place a memorable
will visit again soon",5,
been here two times once at the rooftop and once inside both of times it was fun service was quick and staff was courteous full points for that dance floor is amazing always gets everyone dancing with their jam only thing lacking is the food department need to work on that a bit but overall a nice experience and recommend,4,
decent place food is good music is average staff are polite and service is good not an pub compared to the term pub no dedicated dance floor,3,
"in gachibowli this place is nice to have drinks and dance zomato gold offer makes this experince even better 
all the items were good could have been better service was good 
overall 45 rating",4,
went on a friday evening just because i was in the gachibowli side tried the cheese balls and the bell pepper onion pizza the food was decent did not have any drinks so can not comment on that and the ambience was okay but service is what made me really frustrated with the place hence the three star,3,
"really bad experience
for the first time i heard we do not provide glasses to serve water

even worse for the first the i heard that we serve quarter platedinner plate only once on a table and even if it gets spoiled they will not change

and worst of all when you try to talk to manager he is not even interested and asks us to leave the table if we are not liking the experience

would not like to recommend any of my friends to visit the place",1,
the place refused to replace quarter plate the service is pathetic food is on table but no spoons or forks the manager has one answer they are playing by rule book,1,
it is a good place with awesome ambience and a wide variety of dishes to choose from we booked a terrace lounge for our team out and have spent good time the staff are courteous and the service is faster than expected would love to go again here pros ambience food alcohol service,4,
"though it was my 4th time visit to this place but honestly i enjoyed much on weekday party rather than on weekends me and my friend are throwing a party for our colleagues i observed on weekends it is always overcrowded here and will not get seats for group 5 ppl or above may be due to dance floor

this time we got a nice staff who served us very well with his prompt services apart from our drinks we enjoyed rawa fish sticks and delicious pizzas here

ambience 4
food 35
staff  services  5
overall  4",4,
"rooftop bar with perfect ambience for a peaceful time you will definitely like the view from the top

food was decent with satisfactory service music was loud enough to set your mood they do have a small dance floor perfect tiny place definitely worthy of frequent visits ",5,
"awesome rooftop place to hangout dance floor and dj are cool service is the best the way they welcome you take care of your order is just extraordinary yes i am a regular here and almost made friends  if you are looking for a crazy dance party you can have an inside table and if you are on a date rooftop is your place the location attracts the best crowd in the town visit on a saturday and thank me later ",5,
"been here twice i just love the ambience here
open roof top view at nights is something one shouldnt miss
service could be better probably because we went on a friday night happening place it is
food too was not top notch
they do have a dance floor but not big enough
overall it is a fun place to hangout with friends",4,
"with an impressive location it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative the ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room the sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base 

the food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere

the outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain

it is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more",3,
"boy oh boy  the prepossessing set up of rooftop the ambience the beautiful music the feeling yes the feeling we got in this place 

so we just planned out of the blue to go to a place mustang was on the way and we stopped there since it was a weekday we got the top most seating yeah they have 3 levels of seating and even the music was not too loud
addition to this coincidentally it was an almost full moon everything was set for yeh raatein yeh mausam no nadi ka keenara but there was chanchal hawa 

too dramatic i know 
anyway so we had the topmost seating and had this amazing unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars
do not exactly remember the name of the cocktail but i think it was wallbanger and it will get you to bang the wall  did not have food so can not comment but from other tables it was smelling delicious a bit heavy on the pockets but for the view it provides worth it

so if it is all so good y one star less here goes the answer all was well until we were about to head out and i decided to go to the little girls room and guess what i got locked from outside  though after i knocked on the door 34 times they did open it but how much ever i spent on the cocktails was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that i was locked

message for the management please have at least one staff in the restrooms till you shut down to avoid these kind of issues plzzzz ",4,
"good place to hangout and chill the terrace seating is also good ambiance is ok we booked a table via dineoutindia rather than drinks the food is good here
and in frame1 the spicy chicken table which was not that spicy but it tastes excellent and the pizza we ordered was chicken keema pizza which also good with thin crest cheese was also good mustang terrace lounge
the only disappointment is drinks",4,
"awesome ambience cheap beers and you can get kingfisher drought tower in rs 750 food is also up to the mark
beet part they allows stack on weekend s",5,
"waste of time and money
starters served cold main course was just on margin very poor service i repeate very poor service too much of time taken by them to arrive at your place",1,
"mustang terrace lounge
this restaurant and bar is perfect for casual dine in on weekdays and best for friday night they have a cozy interior seating and the outside seating gives the best view of the city the menu includes the best snacks to have with drinks such as malai kebabs tawa machhi dahi kebabs stuffed mushroom and many more
the restaurant has a wide variety of mexican and italian cuisine dishes such as enchiladas quesadillas burgers pizzas and pastas

this is a must visit rooftop place in hyderabad",4,
"i happen to visit mustang yesterday with my family and friend and i regret why i chose it at first place

the service there is pathetic you order any thing  even a beer  it takes them 2025 min

even after repeatedly telling them looked like they were drunk or deaf considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the veg and non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the roti is to come

the manager pavan i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement he had just one answer sorry rather then managing the staff and taking to them he was taking the walk in the park

one star that too just of the ambiance and roof top",1,
loved the place it is very attractive it has the best view from top service is good and enjoyed the tasty food as they customized in the way i want minor drawback found with the parking,4,
overpriced menu if you find the food appetizing here you must really have a bad taste the thai chicken curry i ordered is just an another name for south indian chicken curry,1,
"this place has nice ambience good to hangout with friends
they play really good music all decent crowd
must try cocktails
decent staff",4,
i went here for a drink i got to say i love this place but food here is little not pocket friendly but quality potion size serving and taste is great  would love to visit agin,4,
went for team dinner to this place ambience  was good we tried various items most of them were good and few tasted average as well but over all it was good,4,
the have a great ambience the view from the rooftoop is too good prompt service the food items specially the cheese balls arev ery tasty,4,
"the service is awesome the josh is high
loud music and dance floor  what else can we expect pavan took a great care of us with his pleasent hospitality we had a rocking party",5,
what can i say about this place i used to stay in gachibowli and used to visit the place often it is a happening place during weekends not so much during weekdays but i have never seen it overcrowded which is why i love it so much one negative i would say is that the price are a bit higher than their competition,4,
"nice place  and super experience

food  55 have been here a number of times and the food was always good specially love the pizzas  chinese starters and chef special here

service  45 very quick and prompt

"not worth it at all paid 500 just to end up eating curd rice for the night 

went here last night got a table for 3
the service was extremely poor and slow 
the waiter brought warm water bottle on a summer day  first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass  asked for cold water  he came back only after 3 reminders
he was the only one around  wearing a csk t shirt

when the starters started arriving i was shocked
the starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic un bearable
for a person who has stayed in hyderabad all my life  the waiter gives an explanation that this is how hyderabadi food tastes

mushroom was not good spicy and nothing less
fish was not cooked
chicken was toooo spicy
crispy corn  basic item was oily and under cooked
potato cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

panner did not arrive at all

water arrived

left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course
biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

settled for curd rice

icecream asked for a butterscotch icecream with some gems
icecream was good but the gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate horrible  had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

when i was about to leave the panner starter arrived  i had a bite  it was ok

but i had enough already

everyone around my table were complaining too
but no use 
useless place
never again",2,
"i went in team dinner there on 10th may the worst part is they do not have anything in main course except vegnonveg biryani 
even for staters also they hv very less choice
they do not have grill on the table 
only the staff behaviour was polite
apart from this it is not a standard restaurant at all ",2,

"first the price is too high and the quantity i am getting is lower than the expectation  you can see the cup it is so small like its just gave me for only to taste it and about the taste it is good i like it and i also got a small bread with thislike who eats bread with a daleem
i would not recommend you to eat but if you just want to have a bite of taste then go ahead ",2,
"i ordered the biryani with great expectations the packaging and the presentation is extremely nice and the aroma was great the biryani thigh was frozen in the middle it is a prepackaged frozen food reheated at the time of ordering that is not the expectation at least in hyderabad
the fact that it is not fresh offsets a lot of the positives for me",2,
"ok so this is the second time m ordering from hereand the taste is same as i felt for first time really good experience the biryani comes in very stunning packageit looks good as soon as u open it with almonds on top of itit comes with raita and gulab jamun too talking about biryani it is not too spicy which i like
packaging1010
taste 910
must try",5,
the behrouz biryani is the royal biryani the flavour of rice is super and the pieces of chicken are yummy the presentation of biryani is with fried onions and badam  almond   served with mint raitha and gulab jamun,5,
i never received this order 21812387 today no one contacted me i asked zomato chat rep to have someone contact me regarding this issue please call me after 3 pm ist  i have registered my compliant on twitter handle how can you mentioned without verifying with me that it was delivered  no follow up done from behrouz very disappointing please refund my amount see the rider is still on the way pic,1,
"one of the worst biriyanis i ate  home deliverd thru zomato  very worse  i wud like to cook my self though tired than ordering in behrouseone of the worst biryani i ever had one has to pay for packaging only big packaging and less quantity one should never order from behroz biryani do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesnever try biryani here  however we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the biryani not sure how behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton we have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life  and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 
no taste and no quality i wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani  guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of hyderabad

note 
increase the quality food then no matter what the price is ",1,
so much hype for a sub par biryani ordered paneer biryani taste did not live upto the hype the taste was bland could have been better any local biryani place has much better biryani at a lower price,3,
"i have order for home delivery the service was quick and hassle free

ordered veg biryani from the restaurant as suddenly i was craving for veg i was so impressed by the packing  also they give raita  gulab jamun with it

the biryani was properly packed and was warm enough to eat too it had a really good taste that other places with veg biryani do not it is really different and its very tasty
one can definitely try their veg biryani

 all vegetarians  biryani lovers this is for you

do try it out",4,
absolutely not the taste we indians love we would want food to be spicy and recipes at behrouz and co are not the way we expect not the best choice,1,
"behrouz never disappoints as always amazing packaging and amazing biryani i love the fact that they send the gulab jamun and yummy raita i wish they also include a saalan with itive tried their murgh mahakani biryani which is as usual very flavourful and spicy 
disclaimer have it when it is hot and fresh

bitesizedjournalcom",4,
i was promised to get a refund for an order that has not been delivered they first told me that i would get my money in 24 hours then changed it to 24 working hours now they are not answering the phone bloody cheaters,1,
ordered for zakheedar paneer and got chicken biriyani with the label of veg this is not acceptable at all this is not the first time this is happening with behrouz,1,
worst biryani shahghouse biryani is 100 times better than this biryani very very less quantity price is very highworst biryani shahghouse biryani is 100 times better than this biryani very very less quantity price is very highworst biryani shahghouse biryani is 100 times better than this biryani very very less quantity price is very high,1,
"it is an delicious food old is gold old recipe is gold recipe
awe some food delivery with this biryani they are serving desert was soo sweet n nice n also raitha they are served chilled with cutlery they are served with somp it is tasty",5,
i am big a fan of these place they have one of the best biryanis i frequently order from here and till now they have never let me down you should give it a try and taste afghani style biryani,5,
ordered the much hyped about behrouz biriyani todaywanted to have it since agesso today when the package came i was really thrilledthe biriyani comes in a stunning packageand as you open it the room fills with amazing biriyani smellsthe biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on topthe biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun toothe biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in hyderabadthis one is extremely sutle in tastethe chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily the rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cookedoverall the biriyani was a really good experiencebut i personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way,3,
bad service i have not received the order but i got a mail that you have enjoyed the meal irritating service from zomato  not support team and pick up delivery boy called for delivery,1,
i just love their packing it looks so royal and classy and has the premium feel their biryani makes you feel that you are having the traditional royal hyderabadi biryani and the smell from it will make your mood great stuff keep it up guys,5,
very less quantity and the food was packed in cartoon book very unhappy,1,
the biryani experience started well having said that it is not as good as earlier experience now two simple issues chicken biryani has no chicken and dry fruits have disappeared should bring them back,3,
i have ordered the veg falafal biryani irrespective of the ratings givenbut to surprise it came out so tastyfrom the first bite to the last rice in your plate u will get the royal tasteit had alot of vegetables and the mint raita too tastes welli am not from hyderabadtastes first time biryani herenow i can say why it is so famousfull marks to awesome packagingon time deliveryat the end i must sayadd on it to ur bucket list,5,
"well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore hyderabadi and a true foodie i understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here is my review behrouz is not a hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it is biryani not being local

i might not like it to the core as an hyderabadi but as a food critique i do not have any complaints it is unique in it is preparation was absolutely mild ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters was aromatic and we will garnished with dry fruits

felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and mandi now this review even holds strong backing as i had a irani friend who liked it as well

really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert the gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end did regret eating itand the mint raitha can definitely do be improved

please deliver in time when you take an order your service sucks and so does your delivery algorithm how can you show 0 minutes for 15 minutes near the delivery location,1,
i usually order from here today biryani was 50 in quantity,1,
"pathetic service i ordered twice they r nvr be on time and the taste is worst
nvr go for it that is it nothing more than to review about behrouz",1,
i ordered lazeez bhuna murg biriyani after seeing the royal box of biriyani i was really happy whole packaging of raita and gulab jamun was upto the mark and really good but then the taste it tastes sweet everything was good from packaging to the mouth freshner they gave but i didnt like the taste of biriyanithe quantity was good and was garnished with almonds and cashew,3,
the only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings coz the dish looks pretty but similarly the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich but at the end was not satisfying,3,
it is just average coming to taste you dont feei that lavishness as you feel from the hoardings and all i have ordered from swiggy and quantity is not sufficient for 1person at this price better we can pick many options better dont take it,3,
i have ordered two box is of chicken biryani the chicken piece were too less not what i was expecting for the amount i have spent  on a so called royal biryani hope the feedback is taken positively and acted upon,3,
i did not get my order and i have paid for it already  there is no customer number of zomato as well i need my money back asap zomato guys should have a customer care number or any way to track order there is no support present i need my money or food asap,1,
"biryani aroma is good but aroma is too strong for the taste buds chiken well cooked my only concern is plz use little lesser aroma so that our stomach has got space for the food as well rather than only having aromas taste of biryani is average ",2,
biryani is good but they did not deliver i had to pick it and that too was informed very last minutethe address mentioned did say it is a fassos only take away facility for food delivery companies like swiggy n zomato i was standing there at 10 at night to pick my parcelvery poor service,2.5,
awesome food great experience so far the food as been great every time i order i highly recommend their mutton and murg biryani delivery by zomato has also bee good,5,
horrible experiencei would not rate them at all but since i could not save it without a star i am just giving it a star they had accepted my order and in about 40 minutes when i was expecting my order to arrive called them to my surprise they have just said that they could not deliver my item since they have other pending ordersbe professional or at least have some courtesy,1,
a briyani worth a war is biryani worth a try truely royal biryani right from the packing of biryani to the last rice left everything about was royal although i did not like the gulab jamun but as i said biryani worth a try,5,
late delivery cold food,1,
highly disappointed there is a sea of change in the quality of biryani we ordered last and now its awfully spicy and too wet like eating rice and curry,1,
"pathetic biryani ever i had in my life if u really wants to eat biryani then do not order for here better look for other options

only the packing is good but food is not at all good",1,
this is a good joint that does not care for customer they accept order and do not care to deliver and they do not pick the call neither they respect customers,1,
the best biryani place if you are nearby around you can have a look at this place this is place best biryani all the biryani tests very good they have the old mughals spices which tastes sop unique and very good it is mouth watering biryani,5,
"one of the best place to have biryani in the city this is one if the beat place to have biryani in hyderabad we were group of friend had almost all of the biryani present their all the biryani were very good nice place to hangout here i recommend this place to everyone

"zomato review program
ordered veg shahi subz dastarkwan which comes with the combination of veg subzebiryani and falafelekhees to my suprise i ordered veg and i got nonveg biryani i dont know was that an upgrade for me 

nothing changed but got an add on the black box which has a chocolate lava cake which was the only thing good the package was good like before and as expected nothing to say about that biryani because i did not taste it on an assumetion the biryani was with good mutton peices and didnt look that spicy and had almond pieces over need to improve alot with the service and also taking the taste into consideration for a hyderabadi",2,
not received any order from your restaurant,1,
worst place for vegetarians they serve chicken pieces in veg paneer biryani and mark their box with green labels irresponsible team hiered spoillers,1,
i am very very biryani lover and i tried the behrouz biryani and it was worst taste is too bad  packing is too good but taste is too bad,1,
"packing is good but we have paid for it
salan  over spicey
briyani rice is good  over masala and very less pieces of chicken  not happy",1,
they have not delivered the order and the number they mentioned to call is not reachable we waited nearly 2hrs neither order received or zomato sup port cant do anything about the delivery finally we have not received the order but mail has come to provide the review be careful while ordering from this restaurant,1,
behrouz biryani is listed on zomato and offers online ordering via zomato scrumptious food you can eat in the comfort of your home we ordered lazeez bhuna murgh biryani quantity and taste  fragrance is goodflavorsome and non spicy price is on the higher side but totally worth it what i really loved is received a complimentary dessert gulab jamun the presentation and packaging was amazing  a must try for all biryani lovers,5,
amount of chicken given in biryani was very less taste wise it was good packing wise it was amazing,4,
worst biryani i ever had kickout these blady biryani from hyderabad spoiled the taste and stinking smell from the rice lokks like they served last night biryani i have throwed biryani on,1,
"first impression when i looked at the box i was like awee  the food was packed very well and the gulab jamun in the box has truly surprised me i had ordered chicken biryani for lunch this order was a delivery one
as i am a native from hyd i like the biryani to be having dum and spicy the biryani was less spicey but was good if few more pieces of meat were added it would have been great
a bit pricey though i will definitely try the mutton biryani next time",4,
now this was a surprise i thought it can not be good like they are saying but its really gr8 specially the ghost biryani ordered dum ghost biryani  lajeez bhuna murgh biryani the packing was excellent the biryani was soo good very nice served with one gulab jamun also,4,
"worst biryani i never tested
ambiance is soo colourful to attract the customer
i m giving 1 rating bcoz if the rating star is less than 0 i definitely give u 0 there is no restaurant bcoz ur face will be smashed after they ate
bloody biryani",1,
i ordered chicken biryani it is awful its not fresh it is stored i had stomach ache after eating it i also got a gulab jamun and that is very bad too all the taste is lost on top of all this the price touches the roof,1,
foodengineering one of the new tastes of biryanis in hyd we ordered bone less chicken biryani and mutton biryani which comes with gulab jamun the packing is also up to mark,3,
i dont like this biryani worst biryani not having taste its doesnt mean that biryani taste is good if they are adding almonds in biryani it should in good taste from inside on top of this biryani price is too much,1,
"my husband is fan of biryani served by them so he insisted me to try we ordered 1 chicken n 1 mutton biryani both turned out to be full of flavors heavenly in short very nice compact packaging ready to take in case one is travelling it is a fullfledged meal with mint raita dessert n cutlery good quantity of meat pieces  rice quality at the same time

it definitely breaks the traditional concept of a biryani i personally felt that though it is super delicious it should be named pulao not biryani last but not the least absolutely great at taste and worth the try",4,
"package was kewl
biryani was dry tbh anyhow a different taste it was",4,
waste food,1,
"heard lots of times about this royal biryani finally placed order for murgh makhani biryani
firstly packaging was good seemed like a gift box with cutlery and mouth freshener then coming to biryani aroma was pleasant and circulated over the entire room within no time chicken pieces were well cooked and melted in the mouth biryani tasted sweet even with lots of masala unlike the other conventional hyderabadi spicy ones two addon options available mirchi salan and mint raitha to order as required quantity and quality of rice is good

summing it up behrouz royal biryani is definitely worth a try if you got bored of eating spicy hyderabadi biryani is",4,
heard lot about behrouz biryani so i ordered dum ghost biryani packaging was impressive  quantity also pretty decent and about taste my only suggestion is keora water or gulab jal whatever you have used will help to enhance the aroma of the food not the taste you guys have to work on flavour rather than adding too much aroma,2,
"i ordered chicken buryani it is so tasty
the packing was awesome
the quantity  easily it is enough for 2people
raitha gravy all are good 
and 1sweet gulabjamoon 
mainly packing and look is too good i suggested it to my friends they also loved it",4,
husain ali has a very good communication skill,5,
"i had ordered lazeez bhuna murgh biriyani from behrouz biriyani the packaging really impressed me because in case of biriyani when it is present in a bowl it is tough to eat it directly from that but behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box with the necessary cutleries attached and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out then about the taste of the biriyani well it was not exactly up to my expectations as my personal choice of biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well but this one had spices which tasted sweet so it was basically a sweet biriyani the chicken pieces were small and many like big chunks but were good mint raita was also impressive if you have a sweet tooth in main courses too then you can go for this biriyani i would love to try out other biriyanis from behrouz later some time ",4,
i like the taste but only drawback is that food is not serving hot like shah ghouse does,5,
need more quantitybecause we paid toomuch for a single biriyani,4,
biryani  not just a food for hyderabadis  it is a important part of the routine  love to see them eating it with so much of love  when they serve you so nicely and it makes you eat it like a monster this restaurant is serving similar to the homemade biryani which can make you feel like home  it was worth and you people should change your taste now try this restaurant and i am sure you might get used to this taste,4,
good food and tasty,5,
i ordered my food and confirmed with restaurant after 40 mints wait he didnt delivered then i call them again and they said they are not delivering to my area what the hell is this if order is done then why they are not delivering to my area then i had to go to restaurant to take my food that time really disappointed with this restaurant,1,
one of the worst biryani is i ever had by paying a price of 300 just one plate they claim they are authentic may be at their house but will not come near to real hyd biryani please do not waste your money by giving it a try,1,
whenever we order we want onions and lemons as well that we see lacking except that everything was awesome service,5,
ordered lazeez murgh biriyani quantity is good taste is not goodbiriyani is very sweet mint raita is also not good they did not give onion salad also,2,
poor service lake of responsibility very very worst,1,
fast delivery,5,
i never used to like biryani but after getting many reviews i ordered biryani it was so dam delicious fragnace was also amazing pavking was also too good pepole who dont like biryani should try once they will fall in love with behrouz biryani,5,
one of the best biryani i have ever had in hyderabad the lazeez bhuna murgh biryaniboneless the chicken just melts in the mouth tried it the first time,5,
"i have ordered a biriyani and the restaurant took close to one hour just to prepare the food and the zomato delivery person took 30 more mins to deliver the food one of the worst service from zomato 

when it comes to the food it was pretty average i dint feel like i am having a biriyani",2,
not provided any carry bags difficult to cary multiple packs one time biryani quality not good,2,
"i do not have the exact words to describe how amaaaaaazzziinnggggg the chicken kheema biryani was it felt like food which god is eat mouth watering explosion of flavors in the mouth literally diwali came early inside my mouth
the complimentary gulab jammun thanks for that
best packaging ever
best cutlery ever
i have been in hyderabad since 18 years and i have a new favorite place for biryani
praises and blessings thank you so much",5,
always at its best service or tasteyummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyyyy,5,
ordered murgh biryani it was awsome  quality and quantity wise its decent and taste also add on was a gulab jamun which also tasted well,5,
"ordered lazeez bhuna murgh biryani bonelessreally disappointed with the the food quality and quantity wise its decent but taste wise its bad ",2,
very poor servicing no communication from the restraunt even after 90 minutes of ordering the food very disappointed this is how they treat their customers,1,
"order no 14001414 you did not deliver my food and cancelled it without notifying meplease refund my moneyworst customer experience

10th sep 2018 509 pm was the time of orderi expect my money back atleast",1,
"i heard about behrouz biriyani many times from my friends  so finally ordred dum ghost biriyani as i am a mutton lover

the best thing what i attracted is the packeging and looks it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces fried onions and small almond pieces

the taste was some thing different it was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad 

i would love to order or visit the place again  highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste",5,
there is no gulab jamun so reducing one star,4,
a rich flavoured bhuna murg biryani from this place surely will delight ur taste buds as i opened the box of my biryani the aroma was so tempting it tasted yum topped with lots of deep fried onions and almonds it has more of the lucknowi biryani taste the only reason i do not give it a 5 is it is way too rich as a meal,4,
delivery poor customer support both me and zomato were unable to contact restaurant restaurant did not update status in app as well after 3 hours a guy called me that he is out to deliver the food which is hours after i requested zomato customer care and cancelled my order and it happened second time earlier they answered but said it will take one and half hour i waited and not delivered this is my second bad experience very sad about it,1,
ordered biryani from this place and the packing is the first thing we liked about itits the best and not the regular biryani packing you getthe biryani tastesit has a different kind of mughal style,4,
"we loved your biryanis the two accompanying complimentary side dish raita and gulab jamun were delicious as well the whole experience was wonderful and satisfying thank you so much for the lovely meal and the prompt service ",5,
i have ordered dum ghost biryani the biryani is badcold and the rice is dry as it is left rice to airi felt regretted after ordering thisthere is nothing good tell aboutthis i felt waste of money after ordering this,1,

ordered paneer maggi and it tasted really really good it was hot and juicy the quantity of maggi was good but there were only 45 tiny pieces of paneer,4,
"i ordered an veg corn maggie which was okay to eat  but the fried maggie is are much more tempting and more tasty 
the only drawback on visiting the shop is that they only accept the cash ",3,
delivered before the time specifed,5,
the maggie masala is put alot in the maggie could you please make good maggie rather than making it very spicy  the masala makes it too spicy and tastes raw please improve on the taste thank you for the speedy delivery,1,
"its a small stall beside synergy park campus odc4
they have maggie and also fried maggie tooi ate vegetable fried maggie which is very good to taste and it is around 40rs and also you can see the menu card given and non vegas maggie is also good herethey have limited editions of maggie but all of them are good

food 55",4,
i ordered a shawarma and i received a rotten shawarma i do not understand why people do this it is food not any product if you want to increase the price do it but how can you serve this type of food to anyone this is completely rotten and even smells very bad would never order from you again,1,
fried maggie is are better compared with the normal one normal maggie is are prepared like soup with more water also sometimes they let the maggie to burn and add water in it that would be horrible good to go as a midnight snack,3,
it tasted worst there were no vegetables in vegetable maggi except cabbage and paid extra for cheese which was stinking will not recommend nor order again waste of money,2,
go to place for my midnight snacks have tried almost all the different varieties of maggi served and the place hasnt dissapointed yet chicken fried maggi being my favourite,4,
"ordered a double chicken and double egg maggi and an egg maggi it was delivered to me while it was still hot and steamy that way you can be sure that it is not sticky or soggy it also tasted really good and was cooked properly they had good amount of egg and chicken in both the dishes the quantity was really good and it is worth the money
taste  45",4,
awesome food,5,
ordered double egg double chicken maggi with extra cheese it came hot in a plastic bowl with a fork and tissue paper it tasted pretty good and the quantity was also sufficient,4,
"ordered cheese corn maggi and veg cheese maggi for 100 rupees and review is based on that
quality 55 the maggi was neither too soupy nor thick it was perfect with good taste
quantity 45 it could have been more as per price
delivery  55
packaging  55",5,
"the price is reasonable and the quantity is okay but the taste of fried maggie was good

request them not to add to cabbage in more quantity which will sometimes ruin all the taste but overall taste was good

i said rate this restaurant 710

this restaurant is the only hunger saviour during mid night",4,
good boy,5,
"good place for late night ordering but sometimes it comes like complete masala and taste also disappointed but overall dirrent maggie is in this place  ",4,
"really bad food filled with chilli

i you hate someone give it to them they will surely suffer the next day

they fucked up maggie i do not know what kind of cook they have

unprofessional really bad",1,
perfect for tackling hunger several varieties of maggi are available good in taste and pocket friendly not a fan of spicy food so wish a little less spice is given in them,4,
first time i ate non veg maggie from this place test was good i prefer this place because its near to my office and its reasonable also  good place for khatty,4,
famous place just before the dlf building in gachibowlithey have a wide variety of maggi and i would always pick their authentic fried maggi better to have it at the place rather than ordering online quantity gets reduces when ordered online than you eat at maggi point,3,
"it is a very small food joint like a pan shop and very crowded since there are many other food joints in the same lane
it is nothing exceptional but if you really love maggi then you can give it a try
we tried fried chicken maggi but are doubtful of it being halal 
if anyone knows about it please let me know",3,
"its a small joint located near the dlf it park well who doesnt love maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet you can either visit the place or even place order online i have tried both methods with varying experience 
i visited the outlet and maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery so one thing probably with maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry 

double egg chicken maggi  not as i would have expected it to be 
double masala chicken maggi  definitely worth a try 
chicken fried maggi is my personal favorite 

overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings would suggest order online if you live closeby 

overall 3 
food 3 
value for money 4",3,
too dry and very less stuffing,2,
"i have called for their veg as well as chicken fried maggie a hundred of times just because it is so delicious and has a different taste from all the other maggie places around however 2 days back when i ordered the food it tasted the same but it had a peculiar smell which has never been there i took two bites and just left it those bites created a havoc for me the entire night it left me with a very bad stomach pain i have never experienced before honestly i did not even expect that it would create such a mess people always say avoid street side food which are close to vehicles and all but this place never disappointed me except for this particular order so i guess never risking my stomach again going to miss that maggie so much ",2,
i am a frequent customer here just wanted to share this while i ordered a chicken maggie today instead of chicken i received marinated fried maida ballsmajority of it which looked like chicken,2,
too spicy,3,
i used to really love this place and food the problem is with how the zomato deliveryman assigned to deliver my food did not deliver my food my order was paid online and he took my order for himself he turned off his phone and did not answer even zomato did not update me about the followup i never got my foodjust the money was refunded that is all but is this what you get when you really need to eat and wait like hellbut get nothingthis is really frustrating i do not know why zomato is ruining it is own reputation,1,
i have ordered double egg and double chicken maggie i think this is a single egg with chicken less meggiei did not feel the teast of chickenvery less egg and chicken quantity they packed,1,
not warm,2,
"maggi tastes really good 45 must try item
but never order shawarma from this place it tastes really bad i have ordered chicken shawarma but there are some unusual veggies in there do not even try it",3,
they are preparing good maggi and their test of maggi is also good but their prices are costly then other maggi points also the quality is good,3,

natural maggi taste is missing please do not add additional masala,3,
maggy was disaster,1,
gave cheese instead of chicken,1,
not good and fresh i was thinking to have happy meal but disappointed now hope to have tasty maggi maggi is sticky and fried maggi is also not good,1,

"i used to spot this shop opposite to the dlf it park while coming back from work during my stay in hyderabad always crowded with majority of the it people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night

i was wanting to order from here once for that taste of maggi who does not like a fancy maggi noodles so one fine night ordered for a corn masala cheese butter maggi through zomato  that was the most fanciest name i could find on their menu 

the delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork the maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which i am not that big a fan of it could have been a bit drier but the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter  cheese in the maggi  good cost effective outlet for the love of maggi noodles",3,
this restaurant is a saviour this is the answer for my late night hunger pangs and my snack time cravings whenever i am feeling too hungry to eat biscuits but not hungry enough to eat dinner i order maggi from hunger maggi point it is the best the double egg double chicken fried maggi is my favourite clubbed with offers which is often these are the cheapest and tastiest solution to your hunger keep up the good work fellas,5,
as this maggi point located at a demanding place they least bothered about the food ordered online and send us the poor quality food  better not to order online and do if you wanna waste your money,1,
waste they prepared food before maggi was noo taste waste of money i ordered double egg chicken maggi but i think they put half egg only too worst,1,
fastest delivery,5,
we can get a very good maggi here i had eaten double chicken fried maggi here it was very good for taste and look good for our eyes it was the best snack to eat,4,

"strictly vegetarian

late night needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in dlf for every hungry soul out der but this time i though to order it to my office for my evening hunger i ordered vegetable cheese maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picturepackaging is ok the spoon was poor quality could have been stronger to hold the maggiethe moment i open the box people around me could smell it and it was great looks cheesy and yummm so was the taste it was good never dissapoints price is nominal as well which is around 50 70 bucks for various varieties they serve deserves a 45 i have not tried the momo is yet will add to the review once i try them

taste and quality of food is good quantity is little bit disappointed for me only sometimes this street food will be available even after 1am,4,

"not recommended
the food is bad very bad the bread is stale and then icing on the cake is the packaging

food was not hot,1,
"i ordered corn fry magi which came overfried  and the other order double egg and double chicken magi is also not that good
i never thought i would write such review",2,
"awesome delivery

taste wise it is good can try once very quick delivery

i have placed order around 330 am which close to my work place and i work for night shift

overall okay okay kind of experience late night",3,
happy with the service provider,5,
"who can say no to some delicious maggi hunger maggi point is just the right street food place to hit good variety of flavours and brilliantly made maggi

the operating time is just perfect this place is open through the night and the area is lit you could just go here have a cheap sumptuous meal of maggie be it 2 or 3 am

one portion is quite enough to fill your stomach the place reminds one of college days and maggi in the stalls around if you can relate

personal favourite veg fried maggi would also recommend to try cheese veg maggi",3,
the worst ever,1,
the delivery is fasti think they didnt prepared it freshlythe corn fried maggi is already made and it was dryit was very very spicyi could not able to eat it fullyi threw it in the dustbindoesnt want to give any star at allthe worst zomato order ever,1,
before the time,5,
"maggie is completely burnt taste is worst i didn like it at all worst experience ever will never order in maggie point

worst maggie ever ate",1,
food worst taste and please dont order from here as well as from zomato i orderd double egg and double chicken maggie but they kept half egg and the taste is worst worst worst,1,
"i had bad experience here with masala papad i had went for dinner with colleagues and had order 13 masala papad spice level was too high and it was not editable 15 people were not even able to finish 2 out of thirteen  so do not order masala papad

apart from this rest of the food was good but service was lousy",3,
nice ambiancedifferent and delicious foodpolite and friendly staff servingjus loved the paneer starters  recommend to visit this place,5,
affordable good food i would have given a 5 star if value for money was a factor in star rating waiters were polite  food was delicious good place to eat out regularly,4,
i had the worst experience with the food and the servicefood is not great and the service took so longthe place is not totally airconditioned and the staff is a bit rude to customers,1,
"if you are reading this and sitll going to this place  either you work there or you are dub
i strongly discourage families with kids from visiting this place

writing this review within 10 hours of visiting this place

wish i could give a negative rating this place is ridiculously lazy no this review is not about food cost or ambience this is about people and their mindset

810pm four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm another large party and a couple of other families checkin

820pm menu card was give to us

830pm someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties thug life we order veg biriyani two rotis and kadai paneer

845pm remind them about the order said we need a couple of minutes

845pm other groups already served food

850pm remind them about the order informed it will take another couple of minutes my two year old son already started crying for food elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm again informed it will take a couple of minutes i said i will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s

856pm our family walks out in front of the staff staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

the last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet so no loss in letting us leave

the sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming i can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party but with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity after being reminded about it and in this time and age of digital pervasiveness beign careless about it is inviting trouble",1,
"went for alacarte here heard a lot about this previously went with full of excitement i wanna rate this restaurant in 3 aspects 1 ambience i should say it is just ok they could have done it much better looks like they have spent a lot on establishment but no aww factor 2taste the food tastes good here almost every main course and starter were good except the dessert  carrot halwa and mango juicewelcome drink they both did not taste good 3hospitality the hospitality is quite good i was satisfied with the staff in the restaurant

as a whole i would recommend going here you will love the food",4,
vegetarian options in this place were really good buffet has some good options special mention to panasa kaya curry not so many options in dessert overall a decent place easily to locate,4,
been here for 2 times food is good in both alacart and buffet servings ambience is ok  seafood tasted much better lemon chicken has been my fav dish,4,
food is really very disappointing kheema pulao had many chicken pieces and rice was cooked very bad even kheema was not prepared wellawful experience,2,
"i have been to pot pourri along with my colleague for lunch we had pot pourri chicken roast and mamsammutton pulao both were deliciousone must try these for sure highly recommended place they do have buffet as wellworth giving a shot ",5,
we booked for 40 people for an office party and it was a complete chaos some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant so the expectations were little high but a complete let down firstly they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and i arrived 10 mins late and simply did not get it for starters also some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu our of frustration people started with main course and in between starters were being served what a big mess it was the complete team of 40 was disappointed,1,
here i can not say the food is so tasty it was okay you can enjoy some specific items in chicken those are nice and the ambience also normal but it was nice in the nights we can enjoy the outside view,3,
i got a lot of stuff which are cooked in pot those are simply awesome i really loved the starters very much and mainly the pulavs are superr,4,
"a great restaurant with pretty good ambience
the food tastes good but the price is a bit high
a good place for good food and with a suburban view",4,
"i came here 1 hour back  it took them 15 mins to find a table for me and then the waiter comes and tells half the menu is not available hmmi have already wasted 25 mins time so ordered what was available

now i am still waiting for the food

if you are hungry please do not visit this restaurant",2,
must visit place for all non veg n spicy food loversliked all different chicken varieties n pulao items hereambience n overall nice place,5,
good food and service is also fast and good ambiance is the best partbiswajit is one of the best server in this whole place food is good and quality and quantity are also good,5,
this might be good incase you are looking for ala carte but if you choose buffet one will be disappointed with the spread the items are tasty but the spread is too small need to improve it,3,
"all star to the food service and ambience we were looking for a good banquet or restaurant in gachibowli area to celebrate our 10th marriage anniversary as the moment was special we were looking for a place where we can enjoy the time with family and friends searched almost 56 locations but bottomed down to pot pourri were little concerened if made the right choicebut voila on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations
1quality of food  we have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for north indian taste in food the instructions that we have given was executed line by linenot an inch of difference food was greati got lot of enquires from guests that how did i locate this place very very satisfied must taste from my side bengal fish curry and nizami handi

the starters typically was in taking terms among the guests awsome

2 service the staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally it was no less than a private party though we havnt booked the restaurant fullybut seeing the service we  were very happy 

3 ambience the restaurant is cleanly decoratednot so much noise in decor as we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morningand when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right this is called the owning of stuff 

kudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event very happyhighly recommendedall stars",5,
good food quiet ambience apt for leisure lunch good service as well well worth the price the buffet has enough varieties to indulge in over all a good place to relish the food,5,
we have ordered paneer manchurian but all pieces of paneer are very hard to bite struggled alot got irritated that is why we will not prefer this to anyone,2,
"a good place with a calm ambience and a lot of pots
we went in for the  la carte the service was a bit slow they need to speed up on that we ordered crispy baby corn usually not a fan of corn but loved this one also the masala papad was a good one we went ahead with the main course the kadai paneer and rumali roti were good would give it a 355
overall a place with a different theme and calm ambience this place is worth a visit and is also economical
top pick  crispy baby corn",4,
ordered mushroom chilli and keema biryani mushroom chilli was fine but the biryani tasted like pulao it dint have any aroma and it was not even close to biryani totally tasteless,3,
"while scrolling through the 11 on food offer options in zomato gold we happened to end up at potpourri which is located in a very accessible area in gachibowli

the place opens up to you with nicely set up wall decorations which says true to the restaurants name  with a lot of pots  and amazing ambience

we happened to drop by on a weekday towards the closing time

the staff was still courteous enough to take as many orders as we want

we ordered 

honey chilli potato  45

veg seekh kebab  45

masala papad  35

butter chicken  35

butter naan  45

dal tadka  35

the food and service here is commendable and the ambience is really nice",4,
this place is for peace if you are looking for ambiencetry going on the fifth floor food is edible but not what i was expecting overall the place was doable to hangout,3,
hi so me and my friend enjoy in lunch time with a indian food restaurant food is good service is little bit slow i love the song improve in less spicy food,5,
really loved the ambience great music and of course the food agreed the menu is pretty simple less variety but the food tastes yummy do try their paneer majestic and kaju pulao always a smile on his face our server vijay kumar was very prompt in his service this place is worth your wallet,4,
"we visited this restaurant recently we have ordered potpourri royyala vepudu gongura mamsam  not there in the menu they have made it on our request  and plain rice

potpourri royyala vepudu a south indian style prawn  medium sized  starter dry this dish had at least 1520 prawns the prawns were coated and cooked in spices the prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty

gongura mamsam small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy we found this dish too sour  i guess they have added tamarind too  compared to our previous experience with gongura based gravy

overall experience was nice the service was good",3,
loved the food here i felt that the ambience can be improved and that extra spice can be added with some more colours felt a bit bland however the food made up for it,4,
"had been here to taste authentic andhratelangana cuisine 
tried the cashew chicken starter and the prawn biriyani 

the starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it it looked like some home made beginner dish it was really dry the server even forgot to give me chutney with it 

the only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level it was above normal levels otherwise no special flavour the dish didnt have enough salt  which we added later ourself 
there was some birthday party going on because of which each dish took an hour to get to us 

after all this hassle they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid 

i am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and i was just at the wrong place",2,
"writing this review as soon as i got out of the restaurant
from the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience left right after starters i wouldnt even care to rate it one star one of worst restaurants to dinein i think it will be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the
after reaching at 2 pm there was no receptionist after the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people it was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged that is it a piece of advise to yall if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there neither proper ac chambers nor proper cooling it was hot thanks pot pourri for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable after we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we are opting for veg or nonveg by this time i was already wondering if they thought we are idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want i just realised that it was true
after soup and buttermilk starters were served painfully slow it took more than an hour for them to finish serving just 6 starters were they kidding me they wasted my precious time and this is not what a customer wants if you can not give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere we had to school the waiters regarding their service then we spoke to their leaderi guess and he also gave the same old typical answer sorry i will just get that served for you we do not want no sorry you can not placate us with sorry for our time hard work and money spent after seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to sorrys i decided to leave the restaurant after all this he had the audacity to charge us the complete bill it was 1100 it was not even worth it even if we had the whole menu after arguing he decided to give 10 discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had wouldnt suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant
starters i found the starters to be normal good in quality not very impressive nor was menu standing out if you pay 100200 more you will be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food
1 soup we were served chicken soup it was not impressive it was fine
2 buttermilk under drinks it was tasty
3 chicken tikka it was ok it was hard sometimes soft
4 ajwani paneer tikka it was very good in taste
5 kodi vepudu it was chicken with common known marination i mean it felt like typical indian curry it was just good
6 fried veg green chilli it was just ok in taste could not make out if it is actually chilly
7 corn fried fish it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste probably this is the only best thing there
8 crispy corn corn was crispy as expected and tasted good
main course i found it to be typically common nothing new if you have been to buffets before
accompaniments were regular papad curd naan roti
desserts not much varieties what is there is menu is served
ambience i do not care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience is not tested",1,
ordered chicken fried rice quantity is huge taste is strictly ok the chicken pieces were not nice and i got some bones and cartilage in some of those so wouldnt recommend to order chinese again from here perhaps their other items are better not sure,3,
"this place is known for its authentic regional cuisine it was a small and good ambiance place
we ordered pot pouri royala vepudu which was amazing and hot and sour chicken soup which was good in taste  pachi mirchi kodi pulao was also great",4,
i went there last sunday had a buffet honestly i did not like the food taste and quality of vegetable and specially nonveg items it tasted stale no doubt service is good  staff is always smiling but they need to improve a lot on food quality even the biryani was not up to the mark moreover the chicken was undercooked or old our stomach felt funny when we reached home,3,
i have been here for lunch the place has a very good ambience staff were polite food needs a special mention here we have ordered cashew pulav south indian style and kadai panner both the items are at their best in taste kadai panner is purely love will definitely suggest this place hope to visit here soon again,4,
must try pachimirchi biriyani nice and cosy place service is good reasonable cost the quantity is bit less but overall good experience,4,
they took the reservation before 4 days for buffet but when we reached there they are saying there is no reservation on that name and we have no buffet today they wasted our time and response is not at all proper,1,
staff is good and courteous but the food is pretty average not a lot of options to choose from nothing great ambience also is pretty average,3,
except for service and the starters to some extent nothing was good at this place we tried the buffet and after starters nothing was worth eating and i successfully wasted rs649 i hope they improve it when i visit the next time,2,
"so i met my brother here for lunch yesterday

we ordered spring rolls kaju paneer curry and butter naans

the best amongst the order was the starter the curry was just okay with strong turmeric after taste

the breads we ordered also arrived cold which made them difficult to chew

overall just an average experience would have enjoyed if the naans were better and the curry did not have so much turmeric in it",3,
"went here for a team lunch party a while back and i swear to god the food was pathetic the starters they server were cold and even after calling out the waiter multiple times there was not a positive response
when we called the manager there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty
the ambience is good though if only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating
all we ate that day was curd rice  the entire team
i wish you guys could improve and we would try here again",1,
wow man it is a great place for a happy dine their ambiance their food and their service is just awesome the prices are higher than average and trust me it is completely worth it,5,
worst service provided the ambience felt like a zombie area the team over there was very confused for nothingfrom the time they started taking the order til the time of the bill the waiters were so unpleasantso unhappyso irritatingespecially a lady there omg that lady started giving rude replies when we asked for service  the manager there was  lost too food was not that great it is not worth that price overall experience was horribletotally unhappy never recommend anyone who opts for a good lunch or dinner,1,
"decent place for casual dining
if someone has zomato gold membership one should visit

"pot pourri is one of the budget friendly restaurants in gachibowli indira nagar where we can find telugu cuisine menu along with north indian and chinese one is ambience was good corporate team lunches and dinners make this place crowdy

we have ordered starter as pot pourri chepa and special chicken biryani boneless welcome drink watermelon juice was served pot pourri chepa is a must try loaded with spices and sauces fish was too soft inside and crispy outside just like we desired it to be special chicken biryani boneless was not in the menu but was made and served it tasted good as well

service was nice staff frequently asked for taste of dishes and any spice level changes if required it was really a good try with zomato gold as special chicken biryani was complimentary paid only for starter thanks zomato ",4,
service was horrible waiters dint even feel like taking the orderthe resturant was not busy also for giving that as an excuse resturant has very poor service,1,
"not many varieties available taste not that good
ambience not good too do not understand why people have rated it so high on zomato went for team lunch it was complete waste of money everyone was so unhappy that we made this decision",2,
pot pourri does maintain good food hiegene i have ordered paneer sticks twice from here and love the taste had ordered chicken biryani as well was okayish as not that spicy,4,
very good range of food availble and especially the veg good was really good quantity n quality meets the price ambience is simple too and very friendly staff,5,
it is a good place to be the ambience is very friendly the food is on par with what you expect the prices are decent enough and is not very easy to locate although if you are using google maps then it is easy to find,4,
"had ordered honey chilli potatoes and veg manchurian from here for a small meetup at homeeveryone and i really liked the honey chilli potatoes the manchurian was very averagewas ooozing oil on the bite and didnt hv any manchurian taste

didnt go gaga about it nor did i not like it will try again perhaps this time in the restaurant",3,
i have been to this place for my team lunch on 22nd feb we opted for buffet just to serve the soup they took 20 mins and starters for another 15 mins apparently they did not serve the soup to all my team members and when we tried talking to the manager he was not available neither the servers they hardly have any options available for veg or nonveg food taste is not great and whole service is pathetic what we thought will be a memorable time resulted in frustration for choosing this place not going again neither recommend,1,
food is not good  we all came here for team lunch in starter we only got 4 item but the taste of the starter is not good so this place is not good for veg and non veg lover lovers in sweets we have two ice cream flavours and rasgulla and kaddu ka kheer etc who will eat kaddu ka kheer,2,
"best restuarent near dlf and nanakramaguda
quantity is good and quality is best
for pure veggies kaju pulav and paneer pulav are best options and really enjoyable",4,
toooooo spicy food upset my stomach also some chicken is uncooked i am sorry to say this but we suffered so i am being honest here there is no intention to harm,1,
"rating can be given only for place not for food
considering food i can give only 2 rating items are very cold gave rasam water as soup i can strongly say it is waste for vegitarians",3,
"the staff here is confused first person tells us that paneer items will not be available and that it will take a minimum of 25 mins for any other thing we order and the other person assures us to get everything in 510 mins including paneer items

but the food tasted pretty good
we ordered few rotis with veg kofta curry
and chilly garlic fried rice

the ambience is pretty simple it is one large seating area with different tables

service is a bit slow but the best part is they make sure you are attended for and take down the order as you asked for
i went here for dinner today to celebrate my parents anniversary my mother is never satisfied easily when it comes to food and picky she said she liked the food that was a huge shocker to me
both veg and nonveg are good
we ordered kheema pulavto cover the taste buds of spice andhra chicken tikka veg manchuriaomg awesome it was veg sheek kabab kadai paneer tastier and butter naans

loved the glasses they use to serve water

my over all rating 4",4,
slow service food is not upto the mark this restaurant seems in love with sugar they put it veggies and soup in bulk service staff was not courteous,2,
"we went to pot pourri  as usual like a very good restaurant  ambiance is really good although i am not very big fan of south indian food but hatts off to your chef food is really good
we shall come back again",4,
good place and wonderful ambience staff was very qujck and all are aware of zomato gold so no issue about that but pulav which we order was little bit dry,5,
"food extremely spicy noodles were made in andhra style were very spicy and had whole red chillies in it there was hair in chicken
service bad takes forever to bring food",2,
this place is very crowded on weekdays they have authentic andhra food my favourite is pot pours kodi vepudu i had thrice and every time i get great taste pulavs are also so tasty here must try place,4,
"good to check in there
the dishes are best to there theme
which they have the best of cuisine for there variant of selection have a good team lunch
cheers team",5,
i ordered for curd rice really very very good and lip smacking the food is hygienic maintain the same quality all the very best i m marking this as one of my fav place,5,
starters are very good we went for normal eating not for buffet we ordered andhra dishes kaju kodi and pot pouri kodi starters are spicy and tasty pandumirchi kodi pulav is good the quality and quantity is real good ambience is also awesome but ac is little less definitely worth for revisit,5,
i and my partner had visited this place during their valentine is day romantic candle light dinner this place has a great ambiance and is low lit with lovely candles ask for waiter pappu he did a great job by recommending us some authentic andhra style dishes which were ideal and he makes us taste b4 serving to check if everything is ok which is commendable we ordered pot pourri kodi vepudu  pandumirchi kodi pulav nd khubani ka mitta with vanilla ice cream someone who has a sweet tooth should try this dessert which is a perfect marraige of great tastes,5,
i visited this place last friday with my friends and we had ala carte i do not want to give any rating the service was very poor and slow there main focus was people having buffet after waiting for 25 mins and lot of reminders we got our food when the bill came they have added additional items which we did not had cost around 600 to the bill and my friends bad she did not checked the bill that time so after this horrible experience i will suggest not to visit and id you are visting and having ala carte please cross check the bill before paying otherwise you can be the next victims of this thugs restaurant,1,
"quality was excellent
ambience was good
great service by pappu
chicken lollipops was good
chicken fry pulav was not up to mark
dessert was really delicious
one should try it",5,
this is a very good place i am fond of patiala chicken here ambiance is very good and service is ok one can try this place once location is also good,4,
good portion sizes quite tasty food super quick service and got the right mix of cuisines in the menu everything just about right for your tum,5,
the worst experience that i had along with friends the starters are good but the main course is completely tasteless even after informing the management about the taste they were asking if salt or spice is more but not about the overall quality  taste about the food very much disappointed that i took my friends for a treat here,1,
"well this restaurant looked really appealing and we wanted to try it very badly so we ordered a lot veg and non veg dishes the best was were the chinese starters honey chilli potato was amazing the shangai veg was also good non veg starters were not that great though and we ordered naan and kadai paneer there was absolutely no salt and the paneer was really hard biriyani was really good and the schezuan rice not good either i think they added coconut oil to it i am really not a big fan of coconut oil can visit once
ambience  35
food  3
service  4
cleanliness 45",3,
worst biryani and worst serving experience  except 3 starters remaining items are very bad totally worth less food and time waste  disappointed,1,
"this place has nice ambience and is very clean and hygienic
wat was good
 chickenkaju starter
 babycorn munchuria

what i did not like
 the chicken biryani was not upto the mark the taste could definitely improve

the staff was very polite and quick to respond i appreciate their behavior",4,
very tasty food with reasonable price and great service drinks also available very nice place to spend some time to your friends and families with lavish dishes,4,
"its a good place to hangout with friends the building itself seems busy everyday crowded place food was tasty  worth the money service was too good

will visit again",4,
"the ambience was good 

i would expect a faster service and the the staff should be attentive to customers rather than to themselves

i would be a 2 star to the staff

food is good not that great",4,
"i thought of giving zero but there is no option instead i am giving it as 1 very worst restaurant i ever visited for buffet 

if anybody is planning to go for it especially for nonveg i suggest please dont waste your money

noof varieties and even the taste is very bad coming to the service no words they will make us to go for main course even though we are not done with starters",1,
non veg is worst ambience and service is also worst taste is bland you can easily avoid this restaurant they take so much time to serve food and even they are not polite,1,
"food 355
we have ordered
veg manchow soup it is good
panner majestic  it was more sour and tangy in taste
nijam handi recommended by waiter it was okay
panner kulcha  its more salty may be because of butter
kothimeera butter roti  this one is good and light

ambiance35 is alright
service 55 it was goooodd papu served us",3,
great place to have a good dining experience had breakfast and dinner here food was awesome and was surprised to provide us complimentary breakfast for all the customers on that particular day,5,
one can try the buffet and the best thing i can experience here is the kodi pulav which tastes very good and also in deserve one can try gajar halwa,4,
excellent taste and awesome food chicken tikka was perfect in all the ways its good for veg and non veg food places is nice with good ambience,5,
one of the best restaurant to visit and have freaky chat with friendsgood ambiance and good place for corporate team lunchvery well established place to dine in,4,
the food was very good also the service provided by one of the waiters papu was really really nice he is very kind and polite keep up the good work young boy,5,
very good restaurant food tastes good and spicy disappointing thing is buffet cost has been increased ambience is little bit conjusted on fridays,4,
"the service was lovely
the food i ordered were
chilly prawns
butter naan
mutton rogan josh

all the items were good but mutton rogan josh was kind of very heavy and buttery so that can be improved

overall experience very good",4,
"nice place with decent interior and delicious food
it is a hygenic place and the food is made of quality ingredients
i like chicken biryani and crispy corn here
if you want to try they have some spicy options too but be prepared i eat a lot of spicy food even i got tears",4,
we went for dinner based on this 40 rating it did not meet bare minimum criteria food was over spiceyhot even after mentioning the spice levels in first course service was very bad they asked how the souppaya was and when we mentioned that it is too spicey  that was not bothered and next course was even more spiceyhot i generally am ok with hotspicey food but this is very extreme i would not recommend going to this place,1,
i personally a lazy person who do not give a regular review but my taste buds made me to write this review the only thing that worth was ambience,1,
ambience and service is good locality of the restaurant is good but taste of the food is not up to the mark can make it more better should improve the taste of their signature dishes,3,
serversushanthis very friendly and polite he suggests each and everything with patiencehis service is also very good finally made this restaurant my regular place,5,
"we had been there for the lunch and the food was good but there were only few dishes in the buffet so unhappy with it
ambiance was preety good needs to improve their service little",3,
"amazing place to have south indian cuisine
good service this restaurant offers ala arte and buffet both  we tried natu kodi pulav and gongura mamsam
both taste good good ambiance  good place to visit",4,
our usual hangout place every time we think of eating out we always end up at this place great staff delicious food and calm ambience chicken drumsticks and veg pulav are a must try,5,
i was there with my friends yesterday for dinner we were served by papu he did great service we ordered all south indian dishes each of them were tasty,4,
"this place was in my bucket list since a very long time and my visit to this place is very random i really liked the traditional ambience the decor of the place is good the service was very slow and the staff i felt were little confused
so pot pourri please look into that
and about the food we ordered chilli egg pandumirchi royyala vepudu mamsam pulao nellore chepala pulusu with tandoori naan the quantity of the food was really good and the food was not different from home food",3,
"we were there with so much hunger at a speed start we have ordered miriyala natukodi vepudu and mamsam pulav miriyala natukodi vepudu was ok but quantity was pretty good mamsam pulav was very good to taste and the spiciness was perfect and quantity was very high i felt oil is high in both orderes

ambience was ok and service was not so fast",3,
"living in manikonda this has been our goto place for good mughlai food if you want authentic hyderabadi biryani then this should be a default option 

have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review 

the chicken biryani is their specialility large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable the quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal

we tried their haleem too in this ramzan and it was delicious creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste something which i really prefer in my haleem 

avoid going for a dinein given the crowd but for home delivery this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed

food  55
value for money  45
packaging  45",4,
"this place was recommended by people for some good haleem and that is the reason we paid this place a visit we ordered two dishes of haleem and two full plates and one regular plate of chicken biryani

the haleem was very well prepared and had the aroma and taste it was delicious the servings of biryani was overwhelming and very filling the regular serving was more than one normal person could eat but the taste was average and nothing new the chicken was cooked well

the ambience was good but a little too full there is no default seating for groups of more than four people and as we were a group of five we had to rearrange a few chairs the service was prompt but understandably very busy",4,
midnight cravingif you are in hyderabad  that too in the month of ramzan then haleem is a must tryit has a very rich  aromatic taste which is more than enough for 2 people,4,
please include vegetable haleem in menu to order as it is only available in pista house we can say the best vegatable haleem is available here and served hot,3,
the best haleem in the city mouth watering tummy satisfying dish eid is not fullfilled without eating this haleem i am very happy to suggest pista house to the food lovers in the city who have not yet tried,5,
"haleem haleem haleem

hello peeps
people around us say pista house  pista house during ramzan just because they prepare haleem well

i was literally waiting for a free time to go  have haleem 
then seeing the very big queue outside the pista house i decided to go home  order

i ordered mutton haleem  naan  paneer butter masala
naan  paneer butter masala were mouth watering to look at  even tasted soooo good

haleem was not that excellent it was ok ok because they added a lotss of spices like black pepper  cloves

it is irritating when you chew haleem  get lots of cloves in between when you chew  i hope you understood lol

paneer butter masala  quantity was sufficient for 5 naans i would rate 5 for the taste but i would rate this restaurant upon haleem only

haleem taste  as i said  not as expected it was just ok cloves spoiled my cup of haleem

i will still give it a try in other branches of pista house  will let you know the reviews",3,
tried pathar ka ghost and loved it this place is famous for haleem which i am yet to try tried a couple of chinese items as well and loved them allinall a very reputed and reliable place to dinein,4,
delicious foodi had good experience with this foodi liked a lotnext time i will definitely choos swagath grand but expected dessert along with veg biryani,5,
this place known for its haleem every year i go there and taste itlove their haleem and also their hyderabadi sweets like kubani ka meeta,4,
yesterday bought rogan josh from here one of the worst rogan josh curry ever i do not recommend this restaurant i have tried biryani from here it was ok big name bad service,1,
well had to eat veg all the time i have visited this place since my wife is vegetarian but believe me restaurant famous for haleem also makes veg items delicious,4,
attitude problem right from receptionaccounts person whoever he isburnt food given twice nobdy carestake bills shamelessly not even asking why food left as it is without being eaten,1,
"if there could be an option of zero stars i would definitely put it it is a very bad experience ordering from pista house the food is good but service is very slow pathetic and bad the managers and people managing speak blatant lies over calls for a order on swiggy
they constantly make the delivery guy wait with false words to both the customers and the delivery partner
if running a hotel business is so difficult maybe a change in management would help completely ruining the name and brand of pista house",1,
best place to hangout reasonable and tastywith proper hygienic the one of the best place in hyderabad the staff is where humble and polite,5,
i have been to this restaurant today and had a real bad experience and was really embarrassed as i suggested this restaurant for dinner with family and friends we had to wait for almost an hour for the placed ordered to be served at the end we were not billed for the items we placed order for and the bill was for extra items it took around 15 mins for the corrected bill with two times to and fro,1,
went twice they have nice decent ambience their mutton galouti kebab is good but they overcook it sometimes the achari chicken was good but the biriyani was too spicy the butter chicken was sweet and spicy served with perfect butter naan no complains about the quantity the quality of the food can be improved,3,
"i have not visited this place ordered online from here
try 1 schezwan chicken  fried rice  it was delicious  good amount of chicken pieces were there it will be more than enough for two it was really hot   
try 2 chicken  tikka masala this was good too it had very good thick gravy will be just sufficient for two 

my rating 
1 food  
2 ambience yet to visit
3 service yet to visit",4,
one of our favourite places for hangout the biryani is mildly spicy and not very oily which we really appreciate kababs are great too isnt very heavy on your wallet so we normally visit this place one every week when office is food vendor provides less than average food,4,
absolutely overhyped place substandard biryani and kababs totally dry and tasteless no dress code for waiters hardly any waiters anyway pathetic service i guess each and every place in hyderabad which is being talked about be it pista house or paradise are totally over hyped,2,
pista house is the restaurant which comes in mind when it comes to biriyani and haleen but i tried chinese here and i must say the dishes tasted too good a very decent restaurant with reasonable price,5,
"went with my office team for lunch the wait time was almost 20 mins so better call them up beforehand if you are a corporate team

coming to price and taste it is worth the money with quantity and taste both satisfying the money",4,
"best best best biryani and chicken 65
chicken 65 has a good amount of gravy one alone can finish it too
quality  55
quantity  455
taste  55",5,
the best biriyani i had ever hadi am in love with their biriyaniand the amount they serve is awesomethe preparation of food is so goodthe quality is also goidi would recommend you to have biriyani from this place,4,
this place is an amazing experience to refresh your taste buds mostly serves cakes pieces snacks and juicesshakes etc but never fails to amaze you it has good seating space and the staff seems to be courteous and does explain you in case of any questions and confusions they even serve eggless products for the vegetarians the place is located on the old mumbai highway and is a little ahead opposite of the care hospitals in the area the restaurant has decent parking space as well,4,
"tried the zafrani 65 biryani and then butter chicken along with rumali roti 

the food is good and perfect in taste with the price is killer and good ambience",4,
"this is an amazing place serving authentic hyderabadi delicacies
the quantity of the biriyani is amazing and the taste is mouthwatering the galauti kebab and the seekh kebabs were magnificent i even brought the biriyani to calcutta while traveling definitely worth visiting",4,
"went to have dinner here on a tuesday the waiting line outside the restaurant did give a glimpse of the amazing food they serve
since it was just the two of us we bypassed the line and got a seat right away
we ordered some garlic naan and schezwan chicken the service was very quick and food was great",4,
"disappointmentbeing one of the famous restaurant chain had lot of expectationswe were made to seat on table with dirty table mats and plates food quality is worst to the core ordered mutton rogan josh which had excess amount of salt to our suprise staff was least bothered to act on it or accept feedback did not have biryanis available hence had to sacrifice with steamed rice and dal
would not recommend this restaurant as needs huge improvement in terms of food quality service and hygiene standards",1,
absolutely amazing had a great dinner with biriyani and kebab friendly stuffs used to take care of their customers as much as they can nice,5,
a restaurant to always rely on this restaurant use to be my default choice whenever i wanted to eat out and do not feel like searching for anew place great quality food and good service their haleem was very nice too though it was a bit sweet for my taste it is suppose to be mildly sweet anyway so it is not their fault the location was also perfect for me,5,
"after a day long review we crashed at the gates of pista house hyderabad

we started with chicken tandoor which was well cooked and tasty

we moved on to have signature patthar ke ghosht  it was soft and outstanding  what a product

then we concentrated on mutton kachhi biriyani it honoured its fame

great service n nice ambience

we had ended up with lovely kheer

cheers",4,
"a very small place with a lot of varieties
worth dining here
zaffrani tangdi chicken was good
went here thrice and was satisfied everytime",4,
superb tandoori chicken mint chutney is awesome got free goli soda as well with food order loved the food quality and quantity and taste,5,
there is a lot of difference between the nizampet and this gachibowli branch too late at serving quality is too poor staff does not respond quickly,1,
"food is ok ok special chicken biriyani was the only good item tandoori roti was burnt after we asked for replacement we got slightly uncooked one i wouldnt suggest this place for north indian cusine
ambience is average
there are mosquitoes  not very clean
service time is quick",3,
"this review is for delivery we ordered a half kg butterscotch cake it was really really great in taste the texture of the cake with perfect amount of butterscotch made it more special

edited review we finally went to the outlet as soon as we entered the food fragrance got us we ordered some snavks and they were good",4,
yesterday we had a dinner at this place the food was good much taste we ordered kebab chicken biryani and thum up the service was late but good we enjoyed,4,
we orderd banjara kebab which was extremely soft juicy and outstandingly tastyfull marks to this starter that melts in the mouththis was followed by zafrani murg biryani which tasted good but not out of the way tastyboth dishes were moderately spiced and i am happy about it great value for money and good service,4,
"went there for lunch with friends and not a good dining experience
1  ambience  not like a fine dine restaurant  more a quick eatery  cafeteria place
2  service   ok  the person who took the order did promptly mention how much time a dish will take to be served it is good to be prepared
3  food  ok to pathetic  we had some starters paneer tikka was good and other ones were ok and from my friends who had tandoori prawns their opinion was not so good  after the starters the disaster came in the name of egg biriyani  we had ordered for 2 egg biriyani  there was no flavour gravy or taste in that it is just a coloured biriyani rice with fried boiled eggs see the photo  it didnt end here we gave a feedback the waiter promptly took the bowl back to get some masala in it and came back and served with masala which was chicken pieces two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates  

we ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful we were charged for that biriyani after some discussion they reduced the  price of 1 biriyani from our bill

overall not a good experience and dont want to go there again",2,
been there for a biryani and they serve better food than any other outlet  far more better biryani then other famous biryani in hyderabad pistahouse for best service  over all i would keep ordering and would trust pista house brand when it comes to quality food,4,
"went for a team lunch the place is opposite care hospital

ambiance

this place has normal ambiance as all the other irani hotels the problem is that there are a lot of swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels we felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there

food quality

we ordered three items

1 devils chicken
 chewy chicken coated this was the best dish of the lot

2 tandoori chicken
 fully burnt coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3 premium biryani this was really bad when people go to a irani style hotel there are some expectations we like biriyani dum cooked this particular biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl please be careful as this can only serve 3 people the rice was passable and the biriyani was fully mixed not the layering like it is supposed to be it textured like a pulao with the masala  the chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off you can tell that is was stale the chicken pieces were only bones the mutton pieces were not existent

this looks like a outlet which is run by fake people

biryani and food items in traditional hotels like paradise shah ghouse mehfil shahdab bawarchi are really good the tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside

the service took a long time in coming it looks like they are short of staff people will go there by the name and feel bad i feel the pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues this outlet is making a fast buck in the hitech area where floating population is heavy",1,
"ordered 1 zafrani chicken biryani and 1 malai kebabs both the items were very good quantity was enough for 3 people  delivery was quick bottom line is we had a simple and lovely lunch thanks ",4,
worst service strictly nor recommended for family and decent people taste is below average big no for this place stay away worst service ever,1,
this place was recommended by a local friend after learning that i do not favor spicy biriyani and i was thinking about trying hyderabadi biryani once again before i leave yes pista house lived up the expectation good packaging prompt delivery good taste,4,
"had ordered almond cake from pista house
it was not much fresh but tastes okay
over all seemed like they have not delivered fresh cake as i saw water was also coming from the cake
hope so that from the next time they deliver fresh cakes",3,
tried zafrani chicken biryani ordered it for home delivery its was ok not that uch special half egg was an addition still the taste is just ok,3,
"went there a week ago the foods were average i will rate the food a 3 out of 5

now come to the service  we ordered 3 butter chicken but they gave us 1 so had to wait for another 1520mins to get the other butter chicken please do not compare the taste of butter chicken if youre from north india

the restaurant looks good from the outside but inside house flies will accompany you with your food and friends",2,
had a nice evening there yesterday food was decent biryani was good but little dry need to improve little more ambience was good staffs are friendly,4,
an amazing pocket friendly place where they serve confectionery cakes juices now in this branch they are even serving food what more can you ask from a big chain of outlets pista house has always been a wonderful place to serve your small hunger but gachibowli can address any thing that is big and small a big thumbs up forthem for gachibowli,4,
out with family for dinner excellent food with exceptional service plenty of choices very good quality and quantity definitely will visit again,5,
"went for the dinner with the family all the items were delicious you must try the firni in deserts
dont miss the platter and mouth watering non veg platters",5,
worst experience in parcel of zaffron motton regular biryani no mutton piecec found i biryani bill is 158 with gst  fooling public in parcel dont take pacel frm pista house  very bad experience simply looting public money on parcels of biryani,1,
"worst quality and more oily rice quantity is less and pices are more

rice quality is also not good fully desi pointed 

i will not refer to anyone",1,
worst servicei dont know y they have such a stupid attitude towards customersthey r not ready to accept the mistakes they dofood taste is also below averagenot again to gachibowli pistha house,1,
"when it comes to have some veg or non veg main course pista house is always on the top of my lists starting from spicy achari murgh afgani to the delicious veggy nawabi handi with perfect balance of cashwer nuts all are just too good even their kaddu ki kheer in dessert and chicken biriyani are also worth mentioning

atoneplaceonlinecom",4,
cakes were really good and tasty in pista house though the models are quiet simple and normal flavors were really good loved the mango flavor cake,3,
one of the best worst placebiryani is too worstbut their strtegy is too goodthey dont have ac but if we sit and eat the price is doubleirresponsible sericebetter to go to almas r biryanisgood byewill never visit again,1,
"giving this 1 rating for this restaurant is also not needed but giving as it is minimum

we have ordered tangdi kabab and biryani while ordering we were not informed about the time it is going to take but it took 40 mins then we got tangdi kabab with foul smell after fighting with management we got other plate and it not satisfying also same with chicken biryani it is the worst biryani i had in my life till now

i will not recommend anyone to this place

ps  first time i am giving negative feedback on any restaurant",1,
shitty place shitty service shitty management not again not always brand will work think twice before u check in wrost place in recent times,1,
"ambiance 45 nice and clean place
service 45 nice and quick service

food  chicken afgani was awesome chicken pieces were cooked really well and curry was yummy chicken 65 biryani is a bit unique and we really liked the taste",4,
"in my life the worst exp i had as a foody lover dont know what quality of basmathi rice they r mixing for biryani i think 30rs 40rs rice itseems
the price of all items is very highand service is too bad the food path 50rs biryani is better than pista house chii chii i think gachibowli brand is not original dear managment plz check with the quality of food and employees",1,
waste food ordered zafrani biryani its very cool think before night food no ac and the prices are too high for tat qualityno proper service overall worst exprnc think its duplicate pista house restrnt they r making bad remark on brand,1,
biryani is worstno acbut the prices are the same like a big restaurantno proper serviceowner is irresponsiblethey make customers fools with their behaviormost of the ratings might be created ratings as i have seen 80 percent dissatisfaction from the customerswill never visit it again in my lifetheir was no zero rating so giving 1 ratingmy friends and colleagues told me similar response but i wanted to try as it is a big brand finally paid for not listening to them,1,
"a very famous place in hyderabad which previously used to sell only haleem but now it sells a hell lot of thing and the best part is that they sell a delicacy that is special biriyani which consists of mutton chicken fish and yes it will be tough for even 3 people to complete it
we will try the barkas pathar ghost as well

"good food with reasonable prices
ambiance
pista house has a long chain of restaurants in hyderabad this outlet is located in gachibowli near south india shopping mall pista house is bakery and restaurant having a large number of take away products available ambiance is quite congested because they have restaurant in the central area of hall surrounded by bakery also they have separate party hall available for advanced reservation
food
pista house is mostly famous for it is bakery products also in time of ramzan they serve haleem pista house serves indian as well as continental food including chinese italian we ordered chicken burger served with potato chips and ketchup garlic bread chicken tangdi kebab angara kebab and chicken biryani both the kebabs were good in taste and quantity all other food items were very good in taste including chicken biryani they serve zafrani chicken biryani
service
service was average but the staff was polite",4,
"flies in lime soda
fish with foul smelling
chicken lollipop half cooked
prawns were rubbery
do not go for sea food at this place
only better item we had was biryani
lot of expectations were disappointed",2,
"packed chicken biryani and took it all the way to kolkata they loved it  great quantity and taste
it was very well packed too i had no difficulty in taking it so far",5,
u went here as i heard their haleem was great but unfortunately they serve haleem only during ramzan this place is great for kebabs biriyani is great too the portion size is quite huge,3,
"ordered fried chicken biryani it was awesome and it is very lite  loved the biryani  even had faluda it is also yummy  can have different cakes shakes in pista house  100 suggested ",4,
"happy to have pista house set up a branch in cyberabad the choice of food here is fantastic with a wide array of dessertssnacks and shakes for people to order
i personally love their saladschicken tuna as they are done with fresh ingredients and served well
they need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they do not taste the way they look the taste is bland for the shakes
another important concern is the pricing the price of items is different at different outlets the same stuff at tolichowki is cheaper compared to the gachibowli branch",3,
one of the best achari mutton soft and properly marinated meat the spices were properly grinded and cooked the aroma of the food was so mesmerising that after a point we forgot to click the pics zafrani mutton biryani here is a must for all the connoisseurs of good food while other biryani joints also pretty good but pista house has a distinct place in hyderabadi food map the sitafal sweet suggest by our captain was awesome staff was good especially shahrukh with his distinct serving style also bone soup is a must try,5,
been here food is average causal dining for me all biryanis are same so nothing special average ambience average service but little crowded,3,
"mutton biryani is taste less you even do not feel it is a biryaninot at all tasty
biryani lovers plz do not order especially mutton biryani
we ordered chicken tikka it is good",2,
a little heaven for food lovers all the items tasted really good the major perk of this place is their menu is too pocket friendly the best hangout place must visit,5,
"the service is hopeless they will not even serve water for the costumers unless you ask them and the manager is also helpless and rude if the costumers complaint first and last visit to this restaurant ",1,
absolutely worthless service extremely bad attitude from the staff and even the manager is very poor and rude in his approach towards the customers last visit to the place,1,
taste wise they are ok but i do not trust their hygiene had ordered through swiggy and were disappointed with the quality of food chicken lollipop was undercooked there was red blood inside the chicken pieces and had to pull to tear the chicken,2,
"this place serves the best chicken and mutton biryaani in entire hyderabad i always go back to pista house for my biryaani cravings
must try once",5,
"nice ambience and the food was upto the mark looking up for more visits to this place  sunday trifle was great we had biriyani and chicken nawabi biriyani was of much good quantityn nawabi chicken was a bit spicy ",3,
"apart from its good quality haleem what also stands out is their chicken burger i love the taste and the generous size of the burger bun
we usually eat chicken burger from this place and the taste never disappoints
chicken burger is stuffed with minced meat few veggies like tomatoes and nice white sauce

haleem of course is the one we try during festive season overall its a good bakery for snacks  cakes",4,
"i am so disappointed with what i just had today from pista house gachibowli that i do not think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating but unfortunately zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating  hence this 1 star

i have had mutton kheema biriyani earlier from pista house  kondapur  nizampet both of which were awesome and of the same taste  make however the same did not turn true for kheema biriyani from the gachibowli outlet  all my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion so i am not being overly critical at all i do not understand how such reputed brandschain do not maintains consistency of taste  recipe across all the outlets they do maintain consistency with the prices though

not sure if pista house would be be even interested to take this comment seriously or act upon it to get things better for next time but at least i request that they do not cheat on their customer is expectations

what was bad with the biriyani 

1 it was all rice and no kheema
2 this is not at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets nizampet  kondapur
3 trivial though  but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets  while other outlets packs in container  pista house  gachibowli deliver in foil packet 
 
my order details 

through swiggy order no 16352555425
 2 portions of supposed to be kheema biriyani 

no thanks for ruining the friday lunch experience",1,
decent place try this place for hyderabadi biryani very close to the prominent places parking is an issue though avoid during peak hours,3,
"heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home so i finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself high expectations

the place was nowhere near what i had imagined the restaurant was not a very neat and hygienic place the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty the people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in
moving on to the good part the food was cleaner than most non veg places in hyderabad with the chicken having a little less oil than most places the desserts looked sumptuous even though i was full for them i manged to take some pictures of them

so from now on i am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if i go there it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts",3,
"amazing food was much better then expected as it was just a pit stop while passing by 
service guy mr raj was too helpful with suggestions 
worth the visit if your in hyderabad",5,
raj was very polite and the service is good keep doing it keep it upall the best of luck to you continue the same stay motivated and continue the same,5,
very bad service and not that great food no proper behavior from the staff members very poor service even the taste of the food was really bad nothing great,1,
"pista house is haleem is what i look forward to always on a vacation to nizam is hyderabad we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose

dum ka murg  tandoori roti

a little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you no doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt they should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace

next will try their haleem and some desserts too",3,
need to improve a lot on ambience whether it is pathar ka ghost or any other mutton recipe it is simply very good servers are not very well trained but surely very polite pricing is what anyone just so look for,4,
"out of many outlets in hyderabad i was waiting to try one soo i ordered from the one in gachibowli
i tried 2 biryani is from this outlet chiken and mutton amazing biryani  full filing quantity and delightful taste ",5,
"pista house known for haleem in the month of ramzan
orders haleem from swiggy
tastes good
deliver was quick and
the haleem is hot as well

overall ok",3,
this place never fails to amaze me food here is amazing but a little spicy in case you do not like spicy food  haleem is a hit and all non vegetarian delicacies are brilliant,4,
"had their reshmi kebab served with omlette on the top it was good
ginger prawns were oky but their serving quantity was good
chicken biryani and haleem was good as usual ",3,
"i had visited this place with my foodie gang

i loved thier hyderabadi starters
malai kebab was the best it was so finger licking  soft and delicious
pathar ka ghost and tai pai chicken was juicy and tender
thier haleem is the most best thing in town and it is one of my favorite
coming to thier biryani no doubt it is been always good
coming to sweets double ka meeta mango malai was the best
highly recommended place",5,
"visited this place a week ago with my foodie friends they had perfect hyderabadi starters which tasted awesome
the malai kebab patthar ka gosht tai pei chicken were my personal favorites
we also had butter chicken and butter naan the taste was just right not so spicy at all
their biryani is famous so no doubt the biryani was exquisite
service was on point and the sweets were too yumm the double ka meetha and mango malai are the best among them
highly recommend this place for family and friends",5,
"my experience was bad here they kept us waiting for 20 mins and told that the order we placed for biryani is unavailable
same for the sweetdish we ordered",1,
the top layer of the cake was of homey was not that good,4,
"every year i desparately wait to try their haleem during ramadan season
always knew about their haleem and was surprised to taste their mughai range

the food was delicious and quite easy on pockets the place is divided into two sections inside there is a private eating space good for families

the quality and quantity of the food was satisfying

the dessert range in the bakery section was yummy and delicious

the staff was friendly and superfast

you definitely can try this one when you are around this area be it for a quite bite or proper spread",5,
tried their chicken biryani and haleem it was great in taste place is quite rushy so you have to wait in queue to get the seat ambience is not so fancy but you will not regret after going food was great as well as staffs are good,4,
"pista house needs no introduction their haleem has always been the talk of the town

i was here for dinner with friends during ramadan to try their haleem and gorge on some mughlai delicacies they offer

when i entered the place it was packed with people in queue waiting to be seated

coming to the food i totally loved their malai chicken and pathar ka gosht juicy and tender their haleem was yummy too  i ended up trying their bakery section and was not disappointed either
the desserts like dry fruit kheer and mulberry cream bowl was amazing and we had party in our mouths

however there is definitely room for improvement in the hospitality front and this will a big hit with families
good food  quantity along with great prices is a steal deal combination and would definitely be here soon",4,
"visited this place on ramadan and we ordered 6 haleem we where 4 all we thought that we can enjoy the real taste of haleem and the bitter truth was the taste was long gone with the moving season  seriously there is something wrong with this branch too many uncooked bones and intestines  all i can just say is one bad taste is enough to make all the good once bad ",1,
"went to this place on a weekday then also i found this place having a crowd this is a perfect family and friends restaurant
the quantity of this restaurant is very nice and fulfilling this place is good for people considering less spicy option there are variety of dishes available here

i ordered pahadi chicken in starter it had this taste of spinach and it tasted good with mint chutney otherwise quite bland but the chicken was cooked properly
i ordered special chicken curry in main course that was bits of small chicken in rich gravy it was good not very awesome
ambience was decent

can explore once",4,
very friendly staff good service i went for mandi but even buffet was looking nice good and different taste of mandi as well arabianrestaurant,4,
"we have ordered for crispy corn and its was too oily and saltyegg biryani was okayservice and ambiance is good
should take more care for the food",3,
"probably the best mandi i have eaten in hyderabad the ambience is very good the food tastes excellent and the pricing is reasonable the staff is friendly and always ready to serve you
a must visit peas ",5,
"i liked the place quite opp to dlf building gachibowli easy access to the restaurant from dlf

we had mutton juicy mandi liked it

would come back to try couple more dishes",4,
"good food
nice ambience
service is okay
not many varieties in veg curries but whatever they have is good in taste
overall a nice restaurant to have dinner with your friends or family",4,
"chicken hariyali kabab the best kebab served in hyderabad
i have no words to say this chicken hariyali kabab has broken all the standards of taste yummiest kabab ever had",5,
"if you are looking for north indian food i must say i liked it alot ambience is good service is good a regular place or a go to place i would say i do not know how i missed this place we tried schezwan fried rice kadai paneer and roti my friends and i plan to try the buffet there next time 45 from my side ",4,
"first time i have tried arabian chicken soup  i feel a different taste which really exited me to have one more
and also i ordered the fish haryali tikka  the quantity and quality of the food really great finally i tried the marsala special chicken by having little drops of lemon juice the taste is outstanding
the small concern is the naan edges are bit thick and remaining all others are great",5,
"visited for lunch today the food was so yummy and the ambience was very good
must try dish is nonveg chinese platter in which we get fish prawns chicken drumsticks and other 2 types of chicken also it costs around 800 but it is definitely very much worthy and the butter naan was so soft n nice and the assorted chicken mandi was also yummy
overall it is one of the best restaurants i have visited everything was satisfactory",4,
"we went for a lunch outing here it is located at dlf the ambience is good and we expected a good meal we ordered chicken tangdi mutton biryani and coke first thing we got was chicken tangdi and what i instantly noticed was that it was deep fried which is not a norm and was not juicy all we could taste was charcoal this made our expectations very low

in the mean time i asked them to get the coke i ordered it was not chilled hence i requested them to get ice to my surprise they had no ice

and finally we got our biryani it was not bad but there were no meaty pieces of mutton only bones

my advice to you all would be that the food is edible but do not keep your expectations too high",1,
"food is good ambience and interior very nice for groups and couples scope to improve service
we tried chetinad chicken  preparation was ok ok but the chicken was good",4,
was really waiting to visit this place after all the good reviews was quite disappointed with the food and the menu of the buffet not a single stand out dish  chettinad chicken was salty and inspite of me telling them multiple times they turned a deaf ear deserts are so so biryani was fine but chicken was very dry  same case with the fish starter just horrible fruit custard had only bananaseven their water tasted like chemically treated service was alright but this place is highly over rated on zomato,3,
had chicken and veg biryani full can vouch gor chicken good and very spicy and yummy loved the food the ambience and the service very polite staff and clean place would recommend one visit atleast,4,
visited this place in person and also had food delivered from it the mandi and the biryani are some of the personal favorites but i happened to order the egg soft noodles from the place and it tasted really good and the quantity was pretty filling the biryani of the place is packed with flavors and accompanied by perfectly cooked meat if you are a biryani person and want to try some of the best this place should be on your list,4,
food was delicious but the ambience and the service provided were poor every order took at least 40mins to be served very poor cleanliness not sure if i would visit again for a hang out,3,
"lovely food totally enjoyed it

thanks for the great experience enjoyed the food with team

panneer labardhar is so yummy must item to be tried by all the vegeterians",5,
i ordered paneer butter masala and paneer lababdar both of them were decent but one thing which shocked me was there was no kadhai paneer in the menu otherwise all the things were nice including ambiance and the serving and the taste of the food was good i will prefer to go once more and taste other things too,4,
"we were here for a new joinee party with team of 10 people buffet lunch
overwhelmed with their service and courtesy 45
tasty deliciousmouth watering 44 starters were served which were amazing
a paradise for biryani lovers never expected biryani in main course would be this amazing anywhere else
the varieties in desserts is quite different here which included ka for all
double ka metta kadu ka kheer gajar ka halwa kubani ka metta

would definitely visit again",5,
well after going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place we opted to go for buffet option the taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters out of the non veg starters apart from tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good especially apollo fish was not even cooked properly out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better that is what my vegetarian friends said coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with maida which i never try the only thing i liked out of all the main course is mutton curry starting from chicken biryani and sweets like gajar ka halwa double ka meetha everything was served cold probably they forgot to turn on the burners finally it is ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table on a whole it was a bad experience i would like to suggest the management one thing if you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better do not,2,
"clean and neat place for some arabian food as we usually get to see some unhygienic places for this cuisine and mainly mandi

went for lunch with a group of ten and got to order many varieties as we opted for ala carte even though the buffet was reasonable and had many varieties

mandi rice was great but chicken faham is not soft at all mushroom tikka is sweet as it contains some raisins
food 350
service  little slow plan and order in one shot
hygiene  4
vfm  35
worth visiting once more yes
must try  mandi",4,
i visited the resturant last week with my team mates for team lunch for buffet food was really good for both vegnon veg items straters were extremely delicious buffet menu was simple and really tasty worth visiting the resturant for multiple times,5,
"the place is overrated we went on a friday afternoon it was too crowded had to wait for 15 mins to get a table once we got the table order was taken after 15 mins which made it 30 mins of waiting we had to run behind the waiter to take the order order was then taken we had apollo fish kung pao chicken and juicy mutton mandi the fish tasted good chicken was not cooked properly coming to mandi it tasted like we were having boiled mutton with rice was not great at all and the mandi was around 585rs i would rather spend that elsewhere and get 2 mandis for around 600
not at all worth checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed",1,
decent place with good ambience specially the serving is good ajay is guest interaction and serving the food within time appreciable and food is delicious i did not expect this place fills our tummy with satisfaction had nice time,4,
this is newly opened place near gachibowli dlf very famous for mandi our server was kishore he served us very well and politely we ordered mushroom moti tikka chicken mughlai both the items were very good,5,
"i think the restaurant is over rated we chose this place based on their zomato rating and ended up being at a place where only decent thing was the ambience
being a restaurant as they call it i would term it as a local tiffin centre
they charge you for a buffet when what they have is the bare minimum  2 curries 1 dal as their main course btw ice cream served in disposable bowl was their special 
food was tasteless their veg hara bhara kebab was stale earlier i felt their non veg would be good probably the reason for the rating but to my surprise my foodie friends non veg lovers said it was worse than veg mind you it happens rarely with them they can over rate any average non veg restaurant but this was worse
i am forced to believe the reviews are paid",1,
it such a worst experience will never come back again the chicken did not cook properly and even they did not replace and charged price for that,1,
"as a north indian joint in hyderabad marsala food company does not disappoint at all and being a gold partner things become even better
we ordered crispy salt and pepper vegtables as a starter which was a good portion size and enough for two people to share
for main course we went with the recommendation of paneer lababdar with garlic naan the quantity was enough for two people and the paneer lababdar was medium spicy it was made just like how it is made in the north
if someone is looking for north indian marsala food company should be tried",4,
"ordered special chicken curry and chicken kolhapuri do try marsala special chicken curry as it was so rich and delicious saajan was very hospitable the ambition is very nice and staff is courteous must try ",5,
"the place has either bought paid reviews or the management has changed or something similar because we went looking at all the reviews here and it was horrible
food is cold tastless serving is slow and tardy most of the items in buffet were not available for the entire two hours we were there
and to top itthere werent many items served in the buffet",1,
starters were served coldall they did was reheatspoons were dusty and not cleanwe had buffet and some of the items were missing overall food taste rating 15 ambience 35,1,
buffet is a disaster no fresh food all the deserts are from previous day service is pathetic and no friendly environment menu listed about 8 deserts but there are only 5 6 and that too in open vessals,2,
"yesterday we visited this place at 830pm we are 10 people there was not that much rush in restaurant if you are going with zomato gold offer they will treat as beggar who came to eat without paying any money overall very worst experience tomato soup with weird smell we ordered kung pao mahroom as a starter but i can not feel kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all it feels like mashroom chilli we ordered baby corn masala2 and paneer lababadar2 as main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold they added baby corn and paneer pieces which we can easily count there is more gravy then vegetables paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve even service is really slow on regular days i do not know how they manage on weekend waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers best thing is only ambiance

ambiance  45
food  15
service  15",1,
we like to explore all places which serve good nonveg food and seeing the reviews on zomato decided to try this restaurant near dlf in gachibowli overall experience was ok and nothing great they have a big dinning area we ordered marsala special chicken gravy and roti which was with an omelette on top the taste was not something special and we could not get the proper flavour of this gravy basa fish tikka was not as soft as we get it elsewhere usually it melts in mouth and is super soft and tasty but we were disappointed here,3,
good placeorder makes you to wait but when the order come the taste of food makes you feel goodfriendly staff sajantake my order usually i have been to marsala many times,5,
we went as a group of 17 people for the buffet there was widespread of starters 4 non veg and 4 veg all the starters were good the main course was ok and the desserts were good but they were not available after some time it is a good place and worth the visit for the cost,4,
"thanks marsalafoodcompany01 for hosting us and for being such an attentive host 


heard a lot about marsalafoodcompany01 before but never that we thought that we will have such an amazing experience


few days back we headed marsala for dinner the moment we entered it was so beautiful to see lights and colors everywhere

when the ambience is good it already makes half the things right

we had some awesome starters like arabian chicken soup paneer papdi kabab fish 65 chicken lahori tikka golden fried babycorn 

all of them tasted heaven but our personal fav was paneer papdi kabab chicken lahori and golden fried babycorn 

in main course had a massive fish grilled mandiburrrppp  and then had the 2 beauties who came to tingle our tastebuds kitkat shake and chocolate milkshake


if you are from hyderabad and crave for arabian indian or chinese cuisine specially if you are fromgachibowli  then this place is a must visit ",5,
"good service by sajan
food is delicious
love your hospitality
good service by sajan

soooooo good njoy",5,
"i visited this place with my fellow bloggers we had all come here for lunch a place which has been always highly rated and this visit was pending for quite some time we all came here with a lot of expectations and marsala food company did not dissapoint us at all we tasted a lot of items on the menu the best and my personal favorite was the kit kat shake it was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets the lemon coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg wonton soup was good it is not a must try and can be avoided  nothing special about it  this was the only item that was not very good deep fried panner with a lot of masala  undoubtedly one of the best on the menu it is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice  the rice is topped with few manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables a treat for the mouth we also ordered the veg curry and few rotis we were all happy with the curry and rotis  the gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day especially the gulab jamun 
fresh and juicy dipped in the right quantity of sugar solution  even the people who do not have a sweet tooth will love it a place that is a must visit",5,
nothing good tried buffet you need to get your plates for starters water will be provided only if you ask starters are not at all good especially fish we did not seen any difference in look between fish and baby corn main course is limited and are not available readily for us we need to wait for 10min to get curries roti are pathetic not fresh even desserts are bad only good thing is icecream which is served in single cup,1,
"marsala food company located near dlf gachibowli is a multi cuisine restaurant serving arabian chinese and some indian dishes this has been on my wish list from so long so made a visit here with a bunch of friends and the place is simple

to start with we ordered soups
lemon coriander soup
arabian chicken soup
arabian chicken soup was soo good and very soothing to the taste buds

moving to the starters ordered
paneer papdi kebab
lahori chicken kebab
golden fried babycorn
murg achari tikka
fish 65
chilli paneer
chilli basil prawn
veg sheekh kebab
fish hariyali
crispy corn chilly pepper

among these my favourite are paneer papdi kekab which has a crisp outer coatingalso loved the murgh aachari tikka and golden fried babycorn

coming to the main course ordered

marsala spcl fried rice with veg manchurian
marsala spcl chicken noodles with chicken manchurian
grilled fish mandi
mutton juicy mandi
chicken tikka masala
veg kolhapuri
roti tokri

well the mandi taste can be improved a bit but a decent one thought loved the chicken tikka masala and veg manchurian fried rice

not to miss their kitkat shake it was really tasty

ended it up with some desserts
gulab jamun
kubani ka meetha
khaddu ka kheer
double ka meetha
loved the gulab jamun and khaddu ka kheer

over all a decent place to visit with some good ambience",5,
"been to this place after looking at the ratings we had a mushroom moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness in the main course we had chicken biryani which was just decent with bland taste and little masala the service was decent and so as the ambience
i would rate this place as
food  35
service  355
ambience  355",3,
"visited this place recently as it has become the talk of the town 
we started off with paneer papdi kebab and chilly paneer with crispy corn and veg sheek kebab from the veg starters extremely delicious and my favorite was the chilly paneer
the non veg starters were haryali fish tikka chilly basil prawns and lahori chicken kebab
the chilly basil prawns were really good and perfect in every way
the showstoppers were the mutton juicy mandi and the fish mandi such a perfect taste of the mandi rice can easily compete with barkas mandi houses
the desserts well we tried them all like the apricot delight  shahi tukda kaddu ki kheer and my personal favourite gulab jamun
the awesome dish unknown to people who visit this place is the kitkat shake really do try the kitkat shake
highly recommend this place to everyone",5,
"it can not be expressed in words the prompt service they gave the taste of freshly cooked tandoori chicken with perfect spice  appearance the authentic taste of chicken tikka biryani 10000 times better that paradise biryani the perfect type of ambience  a variety of sitting place with outside road view all were amazing and more than expectation u will find little expensive at begining but trust me the quality and quantity they provides is really value for money just go and visit once at least

thanks",5,
"visited this place for the first time team of 7 people after checking out the rating and reviews not at all happy with the management and the staff

1 added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for we cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items inr 500 extra for the items cancelled
reason stated by the staff  if you will not pay it will be deducted from our salary
2 when asked for salad thrice no one served ultimately one of us went to the buffet section and got the onions even this was not noticed by anyone
3 not happy with the quality of food ordered papdi paneer kebab as per the staff recommendation it was dry and not good we told the guy who served and got no response for our concern
4 there are many staff members but lack of management

highly disappointed",1,
"i heard so much about this place and i finally got to visit i was there with few of my friends where we got to try their traditional authentic dishes
the ambience was nice and it was very spacious with good seating arrangement the staff is very friendly and courteous the service is also quite fast
we first started off with arabian chicken soup and a veg soup

then we tried their starters paneer papdi kebab veg sheekh kebab lahori chicken kebab golden fried babycorn fish hariyali chilli basil prawn chilli paneer and crispy corn chilli pepper

for the maincourse we first tried grilled fish mandi and mutton juicy mandi i wished mandi was more flavourful but the grilled fish which was served with mandi saved the day
then we tried special fried rice with veg manchurian special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian and also veg kolhari curry and butter chicken with few breads

we also tried few mocktails virgin mojito kotkat milkshake and chocolate milkshkae

we finally ended our meal with few desserts gulab jamun apricol delight double ka meetha and kheer",5,
"it was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place



the place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience


there are many varities available to eat where its mojitos soups starters maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing


had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soupthe best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip


then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one i had in a very long time then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab then fish 65 was good  the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing i tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that


then went ahead with prawns which was good then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with


the main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hotthe fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture feltand not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat


then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made


the most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
which had the gulab jamun
the shahi tukda
the kuddi ki kheer
the khubani ka mittha


was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes


must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables

good food chicken fried rice is good nice ambience price worthy enjoyed the place with my friends recommended goodfood lovedtheplace,5,
they are just degrading the quality of mandi day by day really need to take a look into this and improve on both quality and quantity of pieces instead of just increasing prices in the menu,2,
"have been craving for their mandi after seeing so many pictures and hearing many good reviews
and finally had a chance to try their mandi and other items from the menu


started with some hot arabian mutton soup
one of the best and a must try here

in their starters
chicken pahadi kabab  hariyali fish tikka and golden fried baby corn were really good
and also we tried this interesting item
mushroom moti tikka it was filled with kova
must try if u are fond of mushrooms


and finally we tried their mandi
chicken fried mandi  this has to be my new fav mandi
rice was flavourful and chicken was super yumm
mutton juicy mandi customised with fish fry  fish were fried perfectly and tasted great
mutton piece needs a little improvement
was a bit hard


in thier desserts kaddu kheer tasted good",5,
chilly corn in veg starters were very good tandoori paneer veg starter was not up to marklot of oil even bread crumbs in tomato soup were too oily rest ambience and service are good here,3,
"marsala food company is an alright place to have a quick lunch if you do not want to travel far from work we ordered a mutton biryani and literally had to tug the mutton pieces apart they were really hard the food is fine and does not actually reach the fine dining standards the restaurant boats of the place could use better service and food quality
overall not a bad place to have a meal",3,
"recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at marsala food company we had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is well to start with as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement they have the arabian style of seating ie sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who do not wish to sit down the place is dimly lit and very calm you can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the dlf gate no 3 opposite to which is this place marsala food company so after we settled down they brought in the soups we had the arabian chicken soup and the lemon coriander soup we just loved the arabian chicken soup it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg the starters included chicken pahadi paneer papdi kung pao mushroom dragon chicken haryali fish tikka golden fried prawns golden fried babycorn chilli paneer lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka starters were really good in taste specially the non veg and seafood starters chicken pahadi a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint coriander ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt had a very refreshing and delectable taste the chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked the dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste the golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste these are really crispy and amazingly tasty you definitely are going to love the starters here  next they brought their famous mandis on our table which included mutton juicy marg mandi grilled chicken mandi and fish fried mandi although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the grilled chicken mandi the rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy and the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender the quantity was also ampleit can serve 4 in between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight strawberry was our favourite made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also you will order for another one  and at the end of it all we were served the dessertsthe desserts which you commonly see in the hyderabadi functions they had the qubani ka meetha double ka meetha kaddu ki kheer and gulab jamun we strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts they were just okayish dessert is the way to man is heartsoo it shouldnt be taken lightly but overall it was a good experience here at marsala the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing do try this placespecially for their starters and the grilled chicken mandi ",5,

i have ordered mandi rice and fried chicken piece the rice is not up to mark and chicken is medium the gravys also not thick over all the food is average and ambience is good,3,
i had a food session here the service was very nice and food was nice too they have this two amazing varieties of soups arabianchicken soup and lemon coriander soup which were amazing dragon chicken and hariyali fish is a must try chiken pahadi was good as well they have two varieties of mandi fish fried mandi and chicken grilled mandi the presentation was excellent i am in love with the chicken mandi here they have a variety of milkshakes and deserts kaddu ki kheer was delicious  lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell,5,
"the food of the place was nice except for murg malai tikka the dish was very sweet and not worth for money the reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu the staff does not know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is cool behaviour

overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in the staff should learn how to behave with the customers

1 star is also too much depending upon how the staff behaved with us last night when i went with a group of friends",1,
food is very tasty  yummyi ordered food twice in zomatoit delivered on time tandoori is my favouriteit is deliciousmy friend suggested me this restaurant,5,
"went there for dinner tried chicken mandi and double ka meetha quantity of mandi was good for two double ka meetha was average ambience and service was ok but could have given 4 stars if the ac could have been a little high and service a little fast i also feel they should also take care of the taste of dishes as there are so many good competitors around

"visitng the place around 10 pm and the ataff was not friendly at all
nice location
decent ambience
require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location",3,
"today i visited this place along with a few friendslocated at the third level of a building right opposite dlf it is at an easily reachable locationthe lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobbythe dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables tooone can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tablesthe ambience is goodthe place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights
now coming to the food i felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions
we started with soupswe had the arabian chicken soup and the lemon corriander soupthe arabian chicken soup was a smooth and mild soup also it was not that thick tooon the other hand the lemon corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to italso it had baby corn carrots beans and such which made it even more better
next we had starterschicken pahadi the pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally usethe pahadi kababs they serve here is really goodthe flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the forknext we had paneer papdi kebabthis is batter fried paneer slicesthe batter and it is seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dishkung pao mushroom was okayishit tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in kung pao dishesdragon chicken and hariyali fish tikka both were amazingi do recommend thesegolden fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that prawn tasteit was good but did not feel like having prawnsgolden fried baby corn was also goodchilli paneer was disappointingthe paneer was not soft and the dish just did work outlahori chicken kabab was also pretty goodmushroom moti tikki is something i would avoidi did not like it but i feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate itit is khova filled mushroomsi could not eat it and so i am not recommending this but you could give it a trywhat if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person
next we had mandisthe juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the chicken mandithe rice of the mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nutsthe fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomenessthe pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique tastethe fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piecethe fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a trythe best mandi you ask then definitely go for the chicken mandi
we also had some milkshakes kitkatbutterscotch and strawberryi loved the kitkat milkshake the mostit had chunks of kitkat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecreamthe milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary
now coming to desserts i was not that satisfied with the dessertsthe kaddu ki kheer was really goodwe also had double ka meetha which i feel was too dry and a bit hard tooalso the gulab jamuns also could improve a bitthey were not bad but not really good toowe also had qubani ka meetha which was okay
overall i would say most of the non veg starters were good and the mandis too are goodthe desserts need improvementthe place is definitely worth a visit",5,
customers will not really care about your ambience or service if your food quality is below par i ordered chicken dum biryani from here relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad the chicken tasted horrible and was stale i had to throw away the biryani you guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues i value food which is worth the money spent and i feel betrayed here i contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this will not happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant they should have issued a proper refund here i did not expect this kind of service and i really do not look forward to trying anything from this place in future,1,
average food and ambience though food range is good and has a good pick of arabic indian and chinese not enough parking service is ok not much crowded on weekend when we went,3,
"sharing my experience at marsala food company as soon as you enter just have a look at the the roof decor it is just amazing and when you get in further to the seating area you will find the regular dinning tables and chairs and then you will also find couches and tables well as this place serves arabian food specifically for mandi ppl some ppl prefer seating on the couches and making themselves comfortable while enjoying their meal the decor is decent and the service was also good let me start with the food review now so i had arabian chicken soup which was so rich and creamy next

i got my hands on their starters like

chicken pahadi kkebab
chicken banjara kebab
kung pao mushroom
paneer papdi kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon chicken lahori chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what i liked the most among the starters were kung pao mushroom dragon chicken and banjara kebab and i felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

getting into the main course now i tried mutton juicy mandi chicken tangdi mandi and grilled fish mandi i personally liked chicken tangdi mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as i love spicy food

treating myself with the milkshakes and desserts now in milkshakes i tried chocolate butterscotch and kitkat i liked the kitkat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of icecream and then kitkat as a cherry on the top and in desserts i had gajar ka halwa double ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer i liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar ka halwa and double ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all i would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper arabian meal ",5,
ordered chicken biryani from here i was totally disappointed with the food the biryani was stale and the chicken pieces tasted really bad never ordering again,1,
food quality has detoriated over past couple of months have been a regular customer of marsala via zomato i guess marsala is having too much of business via zomato for which it has stop caring about food quality for its online customers,1,
marsala special noodles with gobi manchurian were perfected to the taste ambience is average courteous staff clean washrooms will visit again,4,
"very much disappointed with food and items here  not even a single item is satisfied

though service is ok

but main moto should be serve the best food",1,
"first time visited this restaurant  i have given a try by looking over the ambience good thing is  i wasnt disappointed and service from the management is quite good

talking about the food being a veggie tried some panner corns  rotis and soup  happy with the way it is been prepared  served and taste as well

overall the experience was good with the restaurant with a little disappointment over the parking you need to find it by yourself as there is no dedicated parking lots",4,
the best place where you will get worst tangdi kabab same is informed to staff rather taking action they try to convince us to eat,1,
on weekend we were in search of restaurant to have hyderabadi dum biryani as we entered out of office we found number of restaurantsall were busy we found this restaurant in the third floor and thought of visiting this place becoz it is third floor and will not be much crowded but surprisingly people where waiting for seats we ordered for chicken kebabs for starter which was perfectly cooked with awesome taste and after that we ordered chicken biryani which was came up with nice quality and superb taste with good enough quantity by the seeing the price of biryani we got shocked and after looking at the biryani quantity surprised serious it was good quantity for the price after a gap of two weeks we again visited the place have al mandi and we order for grilled chicken mandi which of average taste,4,
"this was our first visit while the ambience is nice we felt that their food was okay

basa fish tikka it was not as soft and melting into our mouths as normally it should we have had better tikkas would rate 35

marsala special chicken curry again nothing special about the preparation except that they served it with an omlet 35",3,
worst experience ever mandi lovers please avoid visiting this place to avoid huge disappointment post office hours visited the place to have mandi ambience was below average there were no customers in the restaurant we ordered 3 mandis which has arrived after 30 minutes and the rice was cold and not tasty at all the meat served was so tough waste of money not at all worth please donot visit this place by seeing 42 stars in zomato profile we will never go back to this place again would have given zero stars if i had a option over all this place is just waste of your time and money,1,
it is a decent place we ordered paneer butter masala and chicken tikka masala both items were very well prepared service was prompt we enjoyed food a lot and it was not that costly too,4,
"i ordered a mutton seekh kebab and a chicken biryani the kebab was ok  35 but the chicken biryani was really bad  15 i never waste food if there is excess i parcel it but this biryani i just have to leave it and come even the chicken pieces are not at all tasty
the ambiance is average  there are different types of seatings and they had pleasant lighting
overall 25",2,
highly recommended great food the biryani is a must have herw the place have some amazing staff  loved the attentiveness and quick service worth visiting,4,
i found this restaurant on zomato and also i can see the ratings of this restaurant is good i visited for lunch and ordered loose prawns chicken biryani tandoori fish tikka and tandoori prawns biryani all the dishes were superb in taste even their quality and quantity are excellent tandoori fish tikka wins my heart amongs whatever i ordered ambiance is good and loved their hospitality,4,
"nice place to hangout with colleagues after a hectic day at work feel good place in a crowded location like dlf
nice ambience
food was good
and they have very different seating arrangement which was nice too",4,
"soups had tomato soup and sweet corn veg soup both especially the tomato soup along with tiny breadsticks was delicious

starters ordered crispy corn chilli pepper and paneer papdi kebab was very much disappointed with the quantity they gave we only get 4 pieces of paneer papdi kebab it was crispy and tasty but could have used a little more spice the crispy corn being crispy corn tasted wonderful 

main course ordered paneer tikka biryani and butter naan along with kaju paneer the butter naan and the curry were decent but the paneer tikka biryani was the best paneer biryani i have ever tasted the paneer pieces were soft and creamy and the rice had a rich taste to it though the biryani could have used a little more spice it tasted great 

ambiance  service this is an evening place for sure and we visited there for lunch so could not really comment on that but whatever we could see looked very good one complaint was that our seats were directly beside a bare glass and we got scorched in the sun for 40 mins before we could get a table away from it avoid the seats beside the glass during afternoon hours the service was a little late but the staff was friendly kudos to that 

ps the only thing stopping me from giving a 3 star is that biryani and those soups loved them so much that i could not give them a 3",4,
i have visited this restaurant with a group of 10 people i have also ordered from here online the food quality was not upto the mark for both the cases the food served to us was stale the ambience is nice though and the staffs are friendly too,2,
"ambiance good
staffs they dont have a lot of staffs to buzz around you but whoever is there they are very courteous
price price is good
must have paneer lababdar and fish tikka
food food was goodquantity is also good as per price
good place for casual dinner",4,
ordered mutton biryani after reading good reviews and the result is bad rice itself was so bland mutton pieces looks melting but the aroma and taste of the pieces also bad so bad that i could not even finish any single piece completely on the whole if you are here for mutton biryani i recommend not to take fyi i am hyderabadi biryani lover,1,
the food here is so appetizingespecially pahadi murgh is so mouthwateringall the food we ordered is so wellseasoned it is definitely a goto place to enjoy all the food lovers what is the wait for then,5,

food is not good we ordered mandi it is worst and mutton is not cooked well we left the food and ordered basil chicken it is also cold and not good overall a horrible experience going there,1,
"mandi is worst mutton is horrible we orde

"extraordinary food i love the chef food is soo awesome great service especially waiters are soo kind my fav food is butter nan and kaju paneer ",5,
great ambience food was tasty ordered golden corn cookedd very well with spciy taste the staff was welcoming the seating arrangement was good they took review after in sticky notes and pasted it in the wall,5,
restaurant is having simple and good looking ambience party type of seating handi type of seating also available coming to the dishes items are tasty and justifying quantity for the prices staff were polite and prompt service we can observe baby corn manchuria and dragon chicken must try here but nite that we can not expect hyderabadi styled biriyani here,4,
"being an eggetarian had ordered an egg biryanii can say this is one of the best egg biryani is you get near hitech city cluster my friend had prawn biryaniand had heard very positive feedback from him
finally had a pleasing lunch i can say gastronomical pleasure

food was cold and hospitality was bad had to wait for soo long to get food prefer going to other restaurants than this had bad experience,1,
"this restaurant was too good in serving food  both quantity and quality wise all the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity ambience was good we had starters lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish tikka main course chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice

we got 2 of them as complimentary with gold
starters were amazing  especially fish was juicy with smoky flavor quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge biryani can easily serve 3 for main course service was extra ordinary totally worth the gold visit looking forward to try other dishes here ",5,
"i gotta tell you this is the best place in gachibowli with a pocket friendly collection went here for lunch and unfortunately some part of this store is not really having shades which resulted in sunlight falling on us while lunch did not feel comfortable while seating there later we moved on to different table

        ambiance pretty normal not so catchy but i would say evenings are the best time to visit this place service is good quite descent number of servers impressed with their work polite calm and patient having enough said about the service and ambiance let is skip into the food

veg corn soup touch of the sweet corn along with the hot sour soup the veg soup tasted extremely well

tomato  crispy bread crums soaked in the sweet tomato soup gives you a mouth watering feeling right when it gets to your table

chicken soup i would say this is the best chicken soup i ever had minced chicken along with the soup can give you the best taste

mutton shorba well this is also a mouth watering dish over here loved the taste of shorba the hot soup served with the piece of mutton can really make your day

  
crispy corn  spicy enough as well as crispy enough this starter really gave us a boost 

chicken spring roll this is where i was pretty disappointed because they failed to impress us not really tasty though 

loose prawns  neatly washed and perfectly grilled the loose prawns were delicious resulting in craving for more

chicken chettinad  well cooked well marinated with enough spices the chettinad curry really satisfied our need 

chicken mughlai  spicy enough delicious enough just satisfying the need for spicy indian food this dish never dissapoints you 

panner biryani  was not really impressed with panner biryani though it could do better 

chicken biryani since i am not a fan of cardamom the usage of cardamom in biryani makes me go crazy but this place and moderately put up cardamom in biryani adding it a slight flavour i suggest it is better to ask before preparing the food

decent place with decent food items been here for mandhi tasted chicken and mutton mandhi taste wise its  but rates are bit high as per me it would be great if the management give a thought on price on food items,4,
"good food good service nice ambience freindly staff

must try
paneer lababdar with butter roti

can also try
papri paneer kebab
prawn briyani and fish tikka",4,
visited this place on a weekday afternoon and it was mostly empty but by the decor it felt that the place will look lively in the evenings so will give it a shot sometime happy hours was on so we got absolut for 150 smirnoff was 70  which seemed like a better deal along with the other stuff tried a couple of veg  paneer starters food was nothing to write home about  but overall a decent and pocketfriendly place for a quick afternoon round of drinks,3,
"now that is a banger of a place just out of the world experience  folks are going mad

music is just awesome and all people do here is hit the floor

ambience is cool and food good

but it is the electric atmosphere thats the special point of this place",4,
"just went to this place for a couple of drinks as drained by the sun a lot good place good ambinace and hide place to hang on get to know apart from weekend friday and saturday rest all the days are ladies night that sounds awesome when u have a girl with u

price range is ok
ambiance is 4
service i did not understood any thing because its just few drinks n snacks

would love to comeback keep upthe good work",4,
"food taste is not good and the staff behaviour is the major let down they fight and argue with you to give more tips
very disappointing never ever experienced it",1,
"you like crowd
like really big crowd  then this is the place you should go also drinks are so cheap here

service was okay for me nothing worth mentioning
music was not that good just loud
not so great food

you got the good and bad about this place
you decide whether to go or not ",3,
"great place to hangout
good food  good drinks  great dj  nice ambience sums up my experience
very few of the clubs which plays bollywood songs  would love to visit the place again",4,
too crowded all the time the crowd management is not that great coming here with girls to party sometimes become a risk especially on the dance floor otherwise it is a good place to hang around if you like loud music i wouldnt recommend this place for a girls group to go to,2,

the music was unbearably loud the food was good but the place was overcrowded and the service was bad overall not so welcoming for a comeback,2,
"the ambience was decent but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded understandable the music was good the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us we actually became a little uncomfortable after that because we were right in front of him waving hands not drunk at all because we were asking for out first drink of the night and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us looks like he had something againts us ",3,
"overcrowded is the first thing that comes to my mind they have a really big place but i guess not well managed it is like open for all people smoking everywhere dj was below average and the sound systems can improve

overall 35

food 45",3,
good place good vibe their bollywood music could get better but currently it is the best available in this area of the city the food is good too,4,
good place to enjoy the music with food and decent drinksit is a bit crowded but what is fun without the crowd d been here many times never disappoints me except for the fact that they keep asking for my id place where you do not need a plus one in hyderabad especially,5,
"cheap n crowded even on weekdays

ladies night all weekday monthu

excellent place to get drunk n dance like crazy

music was loud n awkward  all hindi songs that too many unknowns
dj was below average  seems like youtube videos autoplay was playing

great for people who want some fun on weekdays",3,
we went there around 830 for having a fun night but the place turned out to be a cheap place where people are allowed to smoke everywhere we cant even breathe properlythen we order vodkait was like water and when we questioned them he smiled and kind of agreedthen we ordered long island tea and asked him to make it a good one but it was even worse even their virgin mohito was not gudthen the food was also okishstaff were also not courteousi find the place was overcrowded it seemed they have allowed stag entries and they were passing cheap comment on usi will never recommend anyone here,1,
okay  this place seems okay not so great tables are too small in which we cannot put more than three food items and it was saturday night the dj supposed to start at 8pm we were waiting for the songs to be played till 930pm yet no music nothing and we left the place,3,
"one the best places to hangout specially when you do not want to spend much  the food is great and going in the group would be best  the music and ambience is actually worth it but please book a table before 8 on weekends as it gets much crowded recommended places to go ",5,
club rogue is a nice place to hangout with friends and have a laid back beer on a weekday as well the service is excellent the menu has lots of options in veg as well as non veg the dj was excellent and we had the time of our lives dancing the crowd was amazing there are lots of options in drinks as well must visit,4,
club rogue  located in gachibowli is a good place party and dance if you have gone out with your friends on weekends the place is usually full and suggestion would be to go in early and get yourself a table here you can have some drinks and then dance and yes the food is also quite good only issues  the tables are small and hence not much can be placed on the table saw lots of bottles fall and break but regardless this is a good place if you really wanna party hard,4,
"whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who do not smoke

i went to this club with my friends around 8 it was fine then but slowly the suffocation started there is no proper ventilation guessing based on the experience i had whichever club i have been to there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking the restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue but here at this place i could not see an open window it was all dark i think they really took rogue word to another level
i could not enjoy at all came from there when it was too much for me now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke
i would really want club rogue to address this issue it was very depressing for me and i think the same was felt by so many people over there",1,
ambience sucks worst service they do not book tables and when i asked a waiter for a table for 4 he just ignores and stares away when we managed to make a waiter arrange a table for us he just keeps a table in the middle of the way and asks us to stand throughout our course for the evening well we finally made to a normal table by waiting for others to vacate i highly recommend not to go to this place just sitting outside the building and talking to my friends was lot better than ruining our evening by going to this shitty place,1,
awesome place one of the best places in hyderabar girish was awesome he made sure we had great timethe dj was the best ive seen in hderabad,5,
"been to club rogue last saturday ie 13th april 2019 we chose this place as it was a bollywood night lot of things to get told about this place
first coming to the ambience it is a nice big place the pricing is reasonable we were given a place of our liking after a little followup
now coming to the attitude  rules of the club the entrance has a prominent display which says only couple allowed in after 7pm easily 10 bounces at the entrance but inside nil in spite of the display board saying only couples they have allowed stags in the dance floor was unchecked anyone could dance feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything
the bollywood songs started at 1110pm i do not know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing bollywood music
overall a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution  at your risk  evaluate your need to visit this place
service was good we were attended to well by our server mr kunal",2,
manager was so cheap n attitude showing ego to the guest we visited thrice this time  management pliz take serious action to the manager or else he vil let the business down,1,
"recently been to this place good food and economically priced service was also good
most disappointing part is their crowd management when they have a board outside only couples after 700pm and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags no bouncers to check what is going on floor stags misbehaving with girls trying to feel them smoking on floor no one is there to look around just for their business they r letting everyone in
i will never visit this place with my wifelady friend as there is no security for them one should enjoy the party but with some limits
the management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a rouge place lot of cheap crowd on saturday night better to avoid",2,
"i am at this place 138 friday 12th my girlfriend ordered mango blossom this bar tender here adds chat masala in store bought mango juice

how does the word blossom relate to chat masala

disgusting treatment here at club rogue",1,
"cheap place
really bad service

this place has a quiet weird rule if you show your office id card they will not be charging a cover amount else you will have to pay a cover charge

the bar attenders are so ill mannered i was almost about to slap one
if you can not talk to a customer politely then maybe you should not work at a bar
i have asked for a budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that i ordered kingfisher i am okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious

food was average and served medium hot i think i was served someone else is cancelled order item

music was terrible there was some desi dj who was playing songs out of youtube and there was no quality mixing

ambience 3
service 0
management 0

will i visit this place never
will i recommend this place hell no",1,
one of d best place esp for north indian  good music happening place get damn crowded on weekendso beware  food was ok ok  drinks are not so costly good place for ppl wd dancing shoes and ready to burn calories get ur gang here,4,
"the food and drinks are good
the ambience is great too
but the place feels too crowded and the dance floor sucks
the dj music is alright
the staff is not good and need to be given proper training
the way they rush guests out after 12 is too bad",2,
this place is usual hangout place for guys as it allows to enter if you have a corporate idalso this place is packed almost everydayyou get to hear all types of music in one night so yeah it is worth going here to dance and habe fungetting a table here is bit difficult due to the crowdfood and drinks are cheap hereone thing i dont like here is people who dont know how to behave on dance floor with girlsthat annoys me a lotbut that is not a frequent thing and can be fixed by bouncers being more proactivethanks,4,
"thrice i visited this place thinking it might change my opinion but as always it was a disappointment the staff and the manager extremely rude the service really bad looks like the place does not need customers at all coz i have not come across any waiter who would refuse to serve complained to the manger who was equally rude 
food and drinks are alright but i got wine served in a plastic foggy glass  i go out for the experience when i spend money  i am not sure about the others but i had a horrible experience",2,
"read mixed reviews about this place but the only thing which dragged us here is that the dj here plays bollywood songs and we were satisfied with the dj and the dance floor the place is also very beautiful but the service here sucks the waiters are rude we could not order food as the waiters werent responding properly even for drinks tired of waiting for them to take order we went to the bar and ordered
so if you you to enjoy only the dance floor only them i would recommend this place",3,
the manager named siddarth was treating us very badly we went with a few girls the other guys around were teasing our friends when we asked him he said he can not do anything he does not have minimum courtesy to talk politely with the customers the staff lack basic professionalism one of my worst experiences,1,

great place with great vibes i can give thumbs up to service and food the only drawback of this pub is the dj over all great experience and fun,4,
bad reception and unprofessional staffdo not visit this place they are unfriendly they just loot your money and the prices are also very high,1,
the manager was unprofessional and asked us to leave abruptly and called bouncers upon us coz we justed wanted to see the match the reception is bad no ethics at all,1,
the manager was unprofessional and asked us to leave abruptly and called bouncers upon us the ethics courtesy and reception were very bad,1,
went to this place to watch ipl match which was at 4pm and once happy hours ended they told us to leavethere were more 10 overs left and they told us to leavethen manager came and he shouted at us and he din tell his name alsowe told we will leave after match he called 6 bouncers to send us outhe was shouting as hell and abused usi have been to many clubs but this kind of attitude that too in a cheap place like club rougue is lame afplease ignore this club if u wanna have a good time,1,
me and boys went to watch match here we are regular customers here but manager asked us to leave abruptly in between the match he called bouncers upon us which was totally unnecessary can not have a good time here will not recommend this place,1,
too crowded do not even have place to dance music is good but since it is too crowded you will not be able to dance they should manage the crowd to make it good,2,
"so this is not the review for good musicambiencefooddrink
this is for the manager who was outside at the gate 23rd march 2019 we were three friends and the bouncer at the gate asked for company id as we were stags one of my friend called another who was on the way whether he was carrying his id proof
in the mean time that manager appeared at the gate
we went to the gate and showed the id but he looked at us head to toe and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge without any reason
some other stag groups were entering just showing company id
but this manager asked 2k cover charge from us and we saw he did same with another three guys group
we did not make any nuisance there and silently left the place
so  tell me club rogue why this discrimination
is this the way your managers handle clients",1,
"this is otherwise a good place but all the waiters just always try to steal money by overcharging you for the items that you did not buy this happened with me couple of times they charge you for things you did not order do not return the money and then argue with you

i have seen this happen to others just be careful with the waiters and bartenders on this one they seem to be bunch of thieves this place is otherwise a good and joyful",1,
"i was here with my friends  ystrday was my 4th time  every time we visited we had the best memories to take back the music and the dance floor are their plus point  and the service too the food here is reasonable
best place to hangout",5,
"over all good experience but

cons entry only for ppl who show corporate id is kinda too much and also rude behaviour of bouncers instead of making us feel safe they themselves scares the customers

pros price for alcohol and food is at its best and the inside ambience is amazing the way dj plays music is awesome he makes even nondancers to dance till their body aches and also crowd is amazing",4,
"1 bollywood music starts only after 1030 pm dont fall for the incorrect timings posted here before that its routine boring music which is unnecessary loud and you cant converse
2 theres no outdoor or smoking zone so be ready for a lot of passive smoking
3 dj is okay we went there on a saturday not many latest songs in the list if you are a bit away from the dance floor you wont hear the music properly
4 food  ambience  service is fine
5 drinks are below average liit was okay
i asked for fresh lime soda with salt only and even after returning once i got it mixed with sugar syrup and without fresh lemon
6 they serve wine and cocktails in cheap dirty plastic glasses it totally put me off",1,
good place to hangout on weekendsnice crowdgood music the ambience is really good and also the service was quick just a suggestion if anyone else going here do book a table before hand or else with this crowd it is impossible to stand as well,4,
good crowd and ambiance pre booking of table is highly recommended if you do not have plans of just drinking and dancing the floor is big enough though the crowd outnumbers the capacity of it great place for a crazy weekend party,4,
one of the best places to hangout with friends ambience was good and cozy food was good service was appropriate one of the happening place during weekends,4,
i am very regular at this place infact this is the best clubbing experience i have though i tried other pubs but m so much attached to the ambiance people and crowd every sunday to thursday free drinks for ladies the food is amazing someone should definately try chicken drumsticks here they are yum i am in love with this place,5,
"one of the best looking places to hangout for an bar and the dance floor is quite decent the ambience is so nice and should defiantly have a visit

the food is decent and the set menu they serve for lunch is good dont expect much from service",4,
staff was very rude confused the order and asked our group to leave worst service staff i have seen so far in hyderabad strictly do not recommend,1,
"a good place to spend an evening with your gang of friends or your partner has good ambience great food and drinks

few negatives about this place includes not being listed on zomato gold and sometimes it gets a little difficult to get a reservation specially during weekends but overall a good place to hangout",4,
"this place is awesome compare to the nearby restaurants in gachibowli ambiance is 55 must go place best time to enter is after 2130 ",5,
we were there on a saturday night and the place was crowded as obvious the dj played decent tracks and kept the crowd on the edge of their seats we had a good time with the booze and the food be there on weekdays if you are looking to spend time with the friends wanna go crazy weekends should be your choice,5,
everytime i go to this place i have experienced different experience the staff is fine but i did not like the dj only once i have enjoyed a lot with good music out of 5 times a heart cup is far better than this,3,
great food awesome music service is very fast and portions are apt considering the price staff demanded for tips that was the only bit that was annoying but rest was an amazing experience,4,
the dj that came on around 11 pm yesterday night some lady was a terrific disimprovement over the guy who was playing right before she killed the buzz for us entirely and for many others too visibly liked the ambience though would want to visit again iff the same dj never presents themselves again,1,
so unprofessional place being a girl i felt the staff was inappropriate on behaviour and i love the dj anyways over there but the staff is making the place worst so freaking rude,1,
they serve you wine in plastic glasses staff is very rude and unprofessional and they literally force you to pay exorbitant tips at the end was a loyal customer earlier never coming back here ever again try 10d or the lal street instead in the same building,1,
i guess have been here for almost 10 times every week when friday comes i really miss club rogue it has become like my permanent place for freaking out everything is awesome here you just name it weather it be food serivice  ambience anything picture perfect,5,
"visited the place on a weekday but it was jam packed with people the music was too loud to the point that we would not able to discuss on what to order across the table i have been to many places but never had such loud music my ears were ringing after coming out

the service was the worst all of my friends went to the dance floor and i was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card this was pretty humiliating this place probably sees too many dine  dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to
the food was average at best
they entered 200 as tip on the pos machine trying us to pay that for this sty service
the valet meddled with my car is infotainment system
i will avoid this place from now on and stick to more classy places",1,
"the staff is not at all friendly as we entered we asked for place and no one even responded to us order was taken after almost an hour and the straight no answer it is very rude added they do not have half of the things in menu available place being popular amongst the crowd even on weekdays must ensure to meet the menu mentioned food items and sometimes we specially come to try those food items and also serving cold food is a big disappointment
so i think if the place gets the humbleness and little more friendly it would add on",2,
this place is in the sln terminus mallit is a huge place with young it crowd of hitec city pouring invery good place nice ambience and setting food is good and the party scene is electrifying,5,
"i am thinking where to start there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 23 hours of time we spent there we were a group of 8 we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us
to start with the place does not have well groomed and professional staff they hardly understand what you speak
the first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10 we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us as soon as we got seated a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming it was not even 6 pm then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us we told him that incase more crowd comes we will move
secondly we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses when we asked for glass ones the waiter they do not have any we had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly
the service was slow we had to keep looking for waiters
we were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 pm but the waiters stopped taking orders at 650 pm saying by they serve it would cross 7 pm does not that sound ridiculous
again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones when the argument was not stopping i suggested my friends that we should go to 10d to which the waiter present said we should go to 10d they use glass tumblers after he said that we demanded meeting the manager
the manager came and he was a nightmare he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us when we said we will give bad rating review the manager said ok sir we are also dangerous people we were shocked at this
our evening was spoilt already so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere
this place is not at all professional the staff and their business ethics are horrible will never visit ever",1,
greetings the ambience is good  okayish  with artificial plants towards the gallery area too dark for a pub sitting is good dedicated dance floor with good hindi new and old songs to garnish upon too loud though do not have draught beer have pint prices slightly towards higher side crispy corn made the day  night  do try,3,
"this place freakin crazy lil fuzzy over crowded but crazy mood changer enterin it changes all ur mood

food 45
service 45
ambience 45

visitin is repeated for me",4,
"rocking club
but where is my brodj asif iqbal
we want asif
we want asif
we want asif

"hello

what a talent
he is a rockstar
where is asif iqbal
hoping to see him this coming friday",4,
worst place in hyderabad staff has no etiquette is to talk to customers no idea about what is available and what is not in their drinks menu takes more than 30 minutes to get your order horrible experience,1,
ambiance is good there is a dance floor with a good dj food and drinks quality is good and price is ok but service is very bad stuffs are not at all polite and not cooperative even they force to pay tips and use to bargain for the tips which is very unprofessional we did not find any manager as well,2,
"my friend gave his birthday treat here we opted for the buffet going on there buffet was not that great buffet had one chicken starter one vegetarian starter one main course we opted for non vegetarian option choice of roti biryani and gilab jamun
the ambiance was great we clicked alot of pictures there it was fun overall",3,
very unprofessional and rude staffs if you order 2 beers they will insist for a bucket and if you do not order a bucket they will take half an hour to bring your order the place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded orders can not be processed properly despite all that inconvenience and bad service they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded music and dj is good with cheap food and drinks which is a crowd puller one can have a really nice time if you can bear all these and if crowd is what attracts you,1,
"very unprofessional and arrogant staff
it takes 30mins to take order 
staff is so careless towards customer ambience also not that much great it is a chillar pub not recommend for couples
crowd is tooomuch because it is they allow stags aswell if you show your office id
it is a budget friendly",1,
"well the service needs to be a bit organised the staff is polite but it is overcrowded place at weekends otherwise the pricing and ambience is quite good enough
cheers",3,
"an amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day is week is slog
food  decently priced huge helpings one dish likely to suffice for two unless of course 
drinks  large rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200 what else could one ask for unless one finds better pleasure in other drinks  beer bucket prices 900 so yeah good place to get the buzz
dance  the heart and soul of the place djs do a great job generally it is edm untill 10pmish and right mix of punjabi bollywood and popular english if you come here 23 days you will figure out the pattern of songs the dj plays but every other day heshe does surprise you

fridays and saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table just saying

closing line best hangout place in gachibowli area",5,
a great place to hang out with your friends  one of the best pubs in the city  it is a little highly priced but overall the ambience music and food matches the bar great food and great music  courteous staff and great service,5,
"ambience  45
food  355
service  45

hop on it is a nice place to hang on for some lazy lunch over and above they do run corporate offers very often which will save our pockets ",5,
"this is the worst place i have ever been too
such a illiterate crowd and the management is too fucked up and i will never visit this place and never suggest this place to anyone",1,
"we were there in a group of 9 for drinks last weekend and we had the most horrible experience ever happy hours were till 7 but they were very reluctant to take any orders in the last 30minwe had to call them repeatedly and then they came dragging their feet when we were placing orders at 650pm they said it was not counted under happy hours no explanation given shady ambience and very diluted drinks food was ok the worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses real shabby ones we asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10d i mean really asking 9 customers to get lost we were unhappy with the server is response and wanted to talk to the manager who was even worse he outrightly threatened us saying they were dangerous people and it would not be safe for us really like really
anyways we got the hell out of there and went somewhere else but it was a very unpleasant experience club rogue indeed has rogues running it would advise everyone to stay away",1,
the non veg starter items specially chicken comes on good quantity and are tasty too the ambience is little shady the service is satisfactory,3,
"the place was amazing people there were really polite
it was crowded af which was good
the music could be better but it was a great night",5,
awesome place with excellent ambience and pocket friendly prices  entry is restricted to couples and corporates on saturday and sunday during night,4,
the ambience of the club is really nice the staff are friendly and the best thing about club rouge is the pricing it is budget friendly for food and liquor,4,
the music here is too loud even for a club you can not hear what other person is saying even if they are speaking in your ear ambience is cool food is okay i think the good thing about this place is that price is a bit low compared to similar places and because of ladies night almost every day of week you will never find the place dull and empty even on weekdays also i feel the dance floor lighting is bit too bright for my liking,3,
"it is one of the best places we have to visit in hyderabad
the food was amaaazzinnngnd ambience was really cozy and greatand there is nothing negative about it it was a fabulous visit",5,
the worst place in the city i was here for a few drinks with my friends and it was during the happy hours which is till 6pm and they were so adamant in taking our order at 550 stating happy hours were closed we had to literally tell them that we were still in happy hours to ask for that price surprisingly they did not like it and the drinks were diluted what surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses like seriously serve drinks in a plastic glass when speaking to the waiter he said  go to 10d they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic it was so rude for him to say that i asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss is order he was just not able to understand what i was explaining to him  i bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime i realised he was not interested in what i was saying i was furious and used f word to which he said you can use f word but we are also very dangerous people like what dangerous he was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they did not have any obligation towards customer service it was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me  i did not need someone is apology  what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business disappointed,1,
the place is not soo good staff is very arogant and doesnt care abt custor service initially they served drinks in plastic glasses and doesnt even have normal glasses to serve drinks manager is using abusive language when requested for normal glasses,1,
"not a regular to pub we went with 45 colleagues on friday evening we landed around 7 and within an hour crowd started flowing in
prices were reasonable and ambience was good service was good enough till it did not get crowded had to get hold of staff member within this crowd
music was good
not much space left with so much crowd inside to dance

a good place to try as its inside sln terminus and stores around for shopping",4,
"i have been here last night and for sure this is one of best places to hangout in the city have been to many bars and have never seen prices like this  they are very moderate and ambiance is very good
over crowded for sure  may be this would a big issue here

food is nice  dj is good and with a dance floor this place rocks if you want to go mad and forget yourself dancing  

sound system would be very loud and prepare for that if you want to visit",4,
"visited this place recently its a good place the food tastes good and service is good friendly staff mocktails didnt taste good but over all the place can be visited again ",4,
waaw have been there almost every fortnight but aura remains same pure 5 star pub within its locality foodmusic crowd this would definitly meet with your expectations,5,
"good place to hang out and relief from your stress
good music excellent dj
please try crispy corn chicken tikka kabab
best of luck guys",4,
it was absolute fun here really loved the ambience and atmosphere service and people working here are awesome location is ideal for a chill out,5,
great ambiencedj is superbfood and service goodpocket friendly club to go convenient location have tried a few items i think their crispy corns is really goodgreat place to hang out with friendsmust try for everyone,5,
"worst experience ever we were three girls and waiters were rude as much as possible they even denied to accept orders and it was just our second order
never seen such a pub run by rude and unprofessional people",1,
"it is a pocket friendly but not a customer friendly club have been here with my friend and i see the staff was busy with own works rather than offering a menu card when the same was raised with the manager he was very arrogant asking us it can not be changed
the place is a definitely a crowd puller but they should remember that even the best clubs go down the pecking order as the time goes
never going to visit this place again",1,
ambience was good but when we were drunk  the waiter has charged extra 100 on our bill please ask the management not to misuse the customers,3,
"place was pretty goodwe went on thursday nite and it was almost full dance floor is quite good as compared to other places and nice place to party we loved the food here not over priced and taste wise it was great somehow i did not like the person serving us there while billing he was forcing to add tip for 300400 atleast and was not getting concinced in small amount  managers should take a control over that
otherwise a must visit place ",4,
amazing place if you visit at day then this place has an entire romantic environment and if visit at night then this place gonna rock your night service is good music has a standard foods are okay dance floor is nice too best is architecture of the pub  however the staffs are insisting for 5 tips which i did not like otherwise good hence 4 star otherwise it deserve 5 star,4,
i am a big soup fan and both hot and sour and tomato soup was disappointing the starter was too paste like in the mouth the garlic naan was amazing daal makhani was below average they gave us complimentary brownie and ice cream which was average as well definitely not a place worth your money,2,
"lovely ambience felt relaxed service could be more prompt 
the roof top besides the pool and the entire view of the city is mesmerizing",4,
"this intimate and cozy restaurant is located in the gachibowli area   the service is quite good with all servers being polite and efficient   ambience of the place is breathtaking and perfect for having group  corporate events or a romantic evening

this place is so good that i have been there three times in under a month  
pasta arabiatta is one of my favourites with the right amount of sauce and seasoning which makes it a perfect dish for all occasions  the homestyle chicken is also very delectable and mouthwatering  all the flavor is kept in while cooking and goes well with a good cocktail 

the prices are extremely reasonable compared to similar places
a must go place to chill and relax with friends or family",5,
was here for sunday brunch the view was great  the pool sky u can sit inside the restaurant or by the pool side the spread was really good they had really wide variety of options in food and desserts  they had live counters in that i really liked tempura fried prawns  and vegetables the starters the main course was really delicious the desserts r really delicious   the staff r courteous,4,
"went there for my husband is birthday

we ordered fish and chips and basa fillet
in both the dishes the fish were not served fresh

service was not that great either as it was the busy hour and only one server was seen trying to serve everyone

ambience is excellent as one side of the hotel is the botanical garden and the other part is the hitech city a beautiful contrast

food 2
service 3
ambience 5

will i visit the place next time  yeah may be for the ambience and no fish dish ",3,
"wanted to checkout this new place and this visit we visited mazzo and opted for ala carte overall only the drinks soup and fish and chips were good service was good the value of food experience was not satisfactory and i wouldnt visit next time

asian clear soup chicken  just warm
sweet corn soup chicken  this is better than clear soup
lamb pepper fry  cold rubbery no sign of pepper tasted like south indian dry chicken curry
roasted spring chicken  tasted bland due to thickness of chicken breast
fish and chips  this was decent enough

chicken fish lamb dinner wine scotch",3,
"went for my birthday dinner on friday night here with my wife
ambience is good but food is very ordinary
we ordered only 2 items fish and chips and sea bass fillet with vegetables both of them were not fresh
service was not stand out either
overall a very meh experience",3,
"this review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so

so 4 of us visited mazzo on the 14th of feb and chose the veg  nonveg options accordingly from their menu predecided at 2500 inr plus taxes per head we expected the basics quality service  excellent food

imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite 

1 the linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it 
2 the livery was stained
3 the restaurant had not set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived
4 instead of being given comfortable seating we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them
5 the cream of asparagus soup was like toilet water so was the avocado chicken corn chowder soup they refused to give us extra croutons because we have already eaten too many what else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup
6 the bharwab subz kebab was dry like dried meat the grilled buffalo chicken was terrible smelling only  how to eat the lamb galouti was decent and the vegetable lumpia was oily and tiny  all in all the appetizers were equally useless
7 moving onto the main course now  for the vegetarian me i was given a choice between the anjeer kesar kofte and spinach  ricotta ravioli i obviously chose the latter duh big mistake when i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry i was told that the halogen lamp made it so then why keep it under the lamp for so long and the former you ask it was so sweet it was like drinking chaasni  the sugar water from the rasgulla or gulab jamun dabba
8 not like the nonvegetarians had it any better 6 hours braised lamb shank or nalli nihari or murgh methi 
lamb  it was more bones than lamb and also baby lamb such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home
nalli nihari  more like nal ka paani no taste no nihari
murgh methi  whywhywhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel roti you ask  please do not
9 and last but not the least dessert
vanilla bean pannacotta  i make better pannacotta and i just wanted to cry the coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring
kesar malai kulfi  this was bought from scoops the server told us also the only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic ate 4 and went home",1,
it is a romantic place pool side wine on 10th floor gives a feel that deserves a high ratings do not try food as we were only for the ambience and the feel of hyderabad breeze with wine,4,
we wanted to have small reunion of our old colleagues and being friday it was difficult to get any quite place so we talk and send some quality time friend recommended mazzo but the time we came the pool side area was full but we requested after sometime the staff arranged a place near the pool area the ambience is very beautiful and romantic on the 13tb floor next to pool having drinks and food with your close friends was a great experience i would definitely recommend this place to all food was very tasty and filling after ages i must have had so tasty and upto the mark rogan ghosh i would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time the only 1 part i would suggest as improvement will be the wait area for giving the order and receiving the food on the tablerest it was a beautiful experience,5,
"on the bday i was looking for a place which has outdoorpoolside sitting and after searching lots of places around including prego which i also like mazzo by marriot came up in the results while zomatoing and i thought why not to give it a shot  anyways this place was in my list since long to explore but i was looking for an occasion or right time to visit and what could be better than a dinner date on your birthday

it is ultimate place if you want to have romantic date with your loved one at poolside basically this is rooftop place with outdoor seating arrangement on poolside with live ipl and indoor seating arrangement with some light musicloved their ambiance

my review is based on session invite

soup  coconut thai soup which was amazingit has creamy consistency and that coconut flavor and thai spices were enhancing it is taste to the next level

in starter we tried beetroot paneer tikka which was damn goodpaneer was marinated in beetroot gravy and they barbeque it and served it with green chutney taste wise it was good

sikampuri kebab  this was show stealer dish of the dayit was stuffed with many ingredients like casherpotato capsicumgreen peas onion khoya kismis and the list goes onit was lusciousmust try

mocktails
mango mint  it was one of the show stealer mocktailthe hint of mint and mango flavor was refreshing

apple cooler  it was sundowner mocktailvery refreshingapple chunks and mint leaves were giving fresh punch to the drink

in main course

stuffed capsicum  this is one of my favorite dish from childhood but trust me nobody can beat this taste  capsicum was cooked and soft enough from outside and the consistency of stuffing was adequate loved it and i would like to day plating was damn attractive

malai kofta  lt was presented in a big pate with small modak shape kofta with creamy and luscious gravykofta was stuffed with paneer khoya and some spices and to balance the taste gravy was little son sweet sideit lip smacking good

in desserts we tried hot brownie with vanilla ice cream brownie was soft enough and sweetness was balancedit was heavenly good 

my overall experience was amazingchef bhuvnesh was helpful us through out our dinning timemrnitin made our dinning experiences comfortable and memorable i would like to mention that every staff member was so friendly and helpful too loved their hospitality

i would definitely recommend this place to have a one of the best experience with food and ambiance",5,
amazing pool side table was given to us hospitality of executive gopal singh is very good as he took feedback frequently and gave us interesting options available looking forward to visit this place again great place for couple to have dinner,5,
"instagram  veganyums

looking for a romantic dinner i would say this is one of the best place in hyderabad amazing ambience along the poolside my review is based on the session invite

we started our dinner with thai coconut soup perfectly cooked veggies like carrot broccoli zucchini dipped into the coconut milk it was very tasty

in starters we were served beetroot paneer tikka and sikampuri kebab plating was very tempting paneer tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it and the kebab it was the best sikampuri kebab i have ever had perfectly cooked and moist inside

in mocktails they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side i just loved the latter one it was very refreshing

then comes the main course we had malai kofta  modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste must try with their herb paratha we also had stuffed capsicum  one of the famous and ultimate dish in india if you have only curry you may find it salty but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven

in dessert i had brownie with vanilla ice cream brownie was nice soft crispy outside and moist inside

overall my experience was amazing with mazzo bhuvnesh  the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner i also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff",5,
"i have been here for my bf birthday and the ambience was really gobsmacking although we have already booked a table adjacent to pool in priori must say this is one of the finest roof top in hyderabad the place is sumptuous and perfect for a date
the staff was really friendly and available all time over all it was a great experience for us

coming to food ist was good and worth the price
as i was on a birthday occasion we got a complimentary browine from the team

if you are looking for a pool side space and need to be seated outdoor i recommend you to book in prior

over all it was really a great experience ",5,
this is one of the best place to celebrate any occasion specially with your spouse we were here on our first marriage anniversary and we were spellbound with the pool view ambience mr gopal singh helped us in the food serving and was great help all together food is average but no comparison to ambience to conclude with it is an amazing experience,5,
"great place to unwind hot and sour soup is not recommended and biryani is must try may be menu can have bit more options specially on indian cuisine

vikrant was very helpful in giving feedback to chef and getting less spicy food for kids

ambience  best in city",5,
"today i had an awesome experience at mazzo marriot we wanted a lot of customization on the food and our chef aritra personally made sure that our food was above our expectations with those intricacies taken care of it was just a pleasure to talk to him as he himself became our host for the evening
1 the ambience beside the pool was great2 great hospitality starting from manager to our chef and the person who attended to us3 great view4 our chef made our evening by adding his suggestions and giving us a discount too5 food was great
great place to visit with family and special person",5,
"i had been to this place on a sunday evening it was calm and pleasant not too crowdy they gave us the table of our choice the food was good mrgopal singh served us the service was excellent would greatly recommend this place to come with your loved ones
ambience  55
food  355
service  55",5,
"anyone looking for a place on the rooftop with a great view
this is the best place for that
ambience is on point
the view is amazing i think its the 13th floor
there is a pool on the outdoor section
which has an access to the people on sundays
my experience was really good
the staff was very polite 
when dining in a 5 star one cannot expect much from the food on taste basis
but i think
by far the best i have had
buffet spread is good they can add more drinks though
just one drink wont be sufficient
but overall its worthy for a good lavish dinner",4,
ambience wise it is the best rooftop place one could possibly ask for the behaviour of staff however is highly disappointing they have this bad attitude as though you are blessed to be dining there now that certainly is not accomodating is it  in fact it ruined the entire experience despite the place being amazing and food being great i guess it really is important to keep tabs on whom you are hiring,2,
gopal singh was very polite and friendlythe place is really very good can enjoyed alot leisuring with family food is tasty too though only limited vegetarian options,4,
"amazing place to be with the one you love on a romantic date spent my first valentine after marriage over here by the pool side having dinner the food tasted great i would say its a place to make memories and go down the memory lane everytime u visit this place guys go and have fun and make memories at mazzo

cheers rakshita nath",5,
giving three stars only because of the good staff and the amazing ambiance near the pool completely disliked the food which i felt was half cooked and tasteless,3,
"the place is awesome with swimming pool on the roof top it is my first visit to mazzo  liked the ambience good service

special thanks to vikrant who was with us all the time to serve and suggesting different varieties in veg dishes

thanks mazzo team for your servicekind of food n what not",5,
greart place aritra was of great help too nice great servers kudos to aritra and others will come back for sure too good best in the city above all pool was brilliant nice concept food was top class,5,
this was my first visit to marriott executive apartments hyderabad and here i got one of the best food i ever ate and the service provided was amazing i would truly thank chef amit from mazzo for the wonderful experience and would surely come back soon,5,
i came first time at mazzo it was excellent poolside restaurant in hyderabad ordered for kathiroll banjara murgh excellent food then we ordered for hyderabadi chicken biryani very good chef was surprised with anniversary cake thank u chef for excellent evening,5,
really loved the ambiance and food thanks to chef guru and chef bhuvanesh for delicious offeringevening very well spent with my kid planning to do my daughter is birthday here,5,
"as the name suggests its supposed to be a marriott and that is what you expect the reality is very different

let is start with my experience even before reaching i was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool and so i did
i was denied reservation saying that it is really full but they finally said they can get me one table i was happy

it has a separate entrance in sln terminus with it is own parking and valet which is real comfortable
now let is talk real business

upon reaching i see the place completely empty maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty i did not understand why they had to do play so hard to get even by the time we left the place was hardly even half full the whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside

ambience  the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest it is very mediocre

staff the worst service ever i have had better service in small restaurants or even small dhabas if i may compare them i had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come there is an inside seating and outside we took the inside because it was too noisy out

i asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me andar koi nahi baithta no one sits inside
if you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open

there was a buffet and we went for it now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there we had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to

being a marriott you would expect some decent service they said if i am paying with card i have to come to the billing counter and pay there such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel

food there was hair in the food starters were okay but main course was very bad and let me make special note of the dessert

if i am coming for a buffet in such a place i would expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop they bought kaaju kathli rasgulla some barfi among some cake etc and no spoons to take them had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert

next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view i have attached pictures

after paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went when we tried to express our grief that waitermanager just blatantly shut me off i am not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place

it was the most disappointing experience i ever had in hyderabad marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property i will for sure never come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here",1,
the ambience was really nice rooftop view makes it for a quiet romantic outing the staff were nice but the food was served cold and was not up to to the marriott standards breathtaking view and the quaint corner near to the pool balanced our entire evening,3,
this place has an awesome ambiance it is really worthy to spend money on this place it is the best place to chill out with girlfriends  but the food it just average,3,
it is true that ambiance is good but the staff has failed to direct me to the restaurant though i requested to book a poolside table they did not reserve only the buffet people will have access to it it seems food was good but the staff was not professional enough,1,
"ask for a five star experiencewill sing this experience for lifetime
ambience105 i was awestruck everything related to this place was awesome the pool side was international standard the view would ease all the tiredness which you ever had the place would bring a certain calmness which you would cherish for very long time i thought my paisa wasul from this ambience itself

food45 everything in the buffet was good starters tikka n roll was really good the welcome drink was also really good

service55 they have certain standards and they really live up to the reputation really enjoyed their hospitality

i suggest everyone to have the experience of the wonderful ambience",5,
"first of all the ambience was just breathtaking there was around the pool i really like pool side sitting arrangement and light soothing music  very quiet place  best for couples

service was great and quick  the staff was very polite and humble  i really like the way they treat customers  you will definitely get a vip like treatment there  

coming to the food  we ordered chicken tikka paneer makhani and naan  all the three dishes was great  perfect combination of all spices neither too much nor too less  just the right amount of spices and other stuffs
in drinks we ordered liit long island ice tea and minty mango  drinks was also good

this place was bit expensive but worth paying money",5,
amazing place with amazing view you have to sit outside near poolside when you go here great drinks but average food amazing ambience especially with poolside table overall 4 5,4,
the only reason this place gets a two is because they have got the best ambiance and the food in brunches is very very good but trust me they have to change their attitude towards the customers we were 6 people went there by making a prior reservation for brunch and to continue till late evening after brunch the reservation was confirmed and it was all good until the brunch was over we wanted to continue after brunch to dinner and we agreed to pay whatever we consume after the brunch hours an hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they have reservations i informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue however we all agreed to leave and asked for bill here is the twist the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cashcard from us they made us wait for more than 15 hours and all this while no table was occupied it was all empty i went to the manager and asked him if he can help us checkout and confronted about the reservations the manager now tells me to continue till dinner i did not understand the issue they had and never bothered to ask too we all left and agreed to never go back there again,2,
"amazing placethe seating by the pool is beautiful excellent staff
the only thing is there could be more lights it is quite dim at some sections",4,
"this place is worth a visit a rooftop with a pool  the ambience is just awesome specially in the evenings one of the best places for small partiesromantic dinners
a good range of food is available have tried thai curry and it is one of the best i have had",4,
nice place to visit food is good exception of biryani starters are preferable but it has an excellent view pool view is quiet enjoyable and just awesome,4,
you will love the ambience as soon as you step in good collection of cocktails and food make this place a must visit among others in hyderabad a great romantic getaway,4,
"jaw dropping ambience

the place is on 13th floor it has 2 sections open pool side and inside area pool side is the place where you should be sitting

i ordered biryani which was pretty nice just that it is with bone and some extra masala is i could taste in it
must try ice tea and chocolate milkshake

staff is quite polite
valet parking
they do not take reservations after 9pm
usually over phone they say the pool side is full but you will get some seats available for sure
the place is open 247",5,
"ambiance is good
servers are courteous
food is cold  ineidble quality is not good and pathetic
walk in for drinks and the ambience kindly find another place for food if your really hungry",1,
roof top restaurant with a great atmosphere you feel like you are not in hyderabad food is really delicious cocktails are worth trying especially long island ice tea waiters are friendly and helpful music in the evening is be a little louder than necessary,5,
was here on a saturday night for my dad is birthday a wonderful place to spend an evening with your family and loved ones the ambiance is calm and perfect the staff is very helpful and understanding and will help you with anything you ask them for the place is managed by nithin and his courtesy and nature of serving the customer is just worth to note had a wonderful time cheers,5,
the buffet is good and rather than the ala carte 1010 for the decor and ambience the service was quick beautiful view of hyderabad a must visit place,4,
"elegant ambience can not say stellar but an interesting place for its suave it ought to visited
brownie tasted perfect for a moment did not know if it was really tasty or i was just hungry my date voted the former idea it was delectable anyway 
chicken tikka kebab was good enough for me as a first timer probably the second time i may not stop appreciating the taste of kebabs at bawarchisgreen red gold or vibgyor at each of those street corners
i was optimistic enough to ignore consequences of only i among two of us decided to have buffet hope against hope perhaps the guy said that we can not share from one buffet order voila i also had to give up buffet i can not force the lady to have it when she was not keen about it thatz the 4 stars else an easy 5 experience
best place for photographs one can cherish the look at botanical garden chunk of greenery with a silver traffic lining from the rooftop
 paul ig pauloprav",4,
"the place is pretty beautiful with serene ambience with a poolside sitting
the food was also pretty good but was disappointed with the biryani served as it was not hot but just a tad warm which certainly affected the taste
the service staff were also very friendly
would definitely recommend if you are looking for a nice and a calm dinner with the loved ones",4,
"reach out to thehedonisticbhukkad on instagram for more 

visited this place for a rather late lunch say somewhere around 34

ambience  simply classic and sufficiently spacious at leastwe felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant this place reeks of class  elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator the place is brightly lit and relaxing though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside we preferred sitting indoors

service  gopal was our server for the day courteous and meticulous he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes the staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite

food  we ordered two drinksi can not recollect the names sorry for that and they arrived promptly at our table within no time ordered caprese bruschetta and creamy pesto penne pasta
i have tried bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way i did here the freshness of toppings was evident the pasta was sufficient for two and that again was a delight to eat had to rushhence could not try the desserts

overall dining at mazzo is an indulgence the prices might seem steep for some but for the experience it provides it is definitely worth a visit",5,
visited 3 times every time enjoyed the food tomorrow 12 th march again i am visiting to celebrate my kids birthday hope it will not disappoint my kid,5,
"been there for brunch food is average at best ambience was good and service also pretty good aritra the staff there was very friendly
the place has a lot of potential lovely view and swimming pool area they should improve food and also the menu itself",3,

"hyderabad is best rooftop as of now with an unparalleled ambience mazzo is hands down the prettiest pool side eatery i have visited in town evenings here are absolutely beautiful sunrises and sunsets are magical open 247 this rooftop will have you falling in love all around the year

ive tried their sunday brunch and it is an experience you do not want to miss i will not exaggerate the food is not out of this world it is decent a respectable salad bar",4,
55 for the ambience the pool side tables under the starry sky is the best  super romantic no complaints with the food the bruschetta is great but only if you have a taste for english food with a sparkle of indian touch,5,
"this was my first visit to this place hospitality is something that needs to be practiced and valued and manager mani mastered it received a warm welcome from the staff wonderful experience with the service and hospitality and food was ofcourse damn yumm

this place is awesome to spend midnight parts in hyderabad very good service i loved it lovely view i enjoyed alot and price is reasonable,5,
"mazzo located on top of sln terminus is the dining wing for marriott is modern extendedstay apartment hotel
marriott is known for it is hospitality and you will experience that here at mazzo

i went to mazzo for lunch on a sultry afternoon the view by the pool was spectacular and breathtaking
i could totally see how this can be the most perfect date place

i had a continental meal and boy was it amazing i had a few dishes out of the menu and complements to the chef amit for getting everything so right

i had indian shorba and fish n chips for starters pork chops and spaghetti carbonara for my main course and a brownie with icecream for desert

every dish was fantastic but the fish n chips and pork chops blew my mind

the fish was delicious and the batter was perfect

the pork chops were extremely juicy and cooked to perfection the mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy and how can i forget that demiglace sauce beautiful

the spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love

plating was just so marriot elegant yet simple

and all of this while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city

a heartfelt thank you to the team at mazzo for putting together such a beautiful meal",5,
"such a special night to remember when we decided to dine in for a midnight dinner at the beautiful poolside restaurant at marriott hotels we had made the night special and marriott in turn surprised us with their lip smacking dishes too we had our hands on few cocktails namely eye of the tiger and bull frog which kept the mood flowing for the night
the chicken and thyme pasta that night was absolutely delicious as the cheese has melted really well as could really enjoy the real taste hands on this was the best compared to any pasta i tried in restaurants at hyderabad absolutely wonderful
wok tossed hakka noodles too surprised as it lived upto the name of why it is called a hakka it purely means an explosion of different flavours in a noodles and it really was at above 400 both dishes really is worth the money further considering the hospitality and the ambience of the hotel

"this is one place where one can spend a lowsy sunday mr nitin was courteous enough to welcome us when we reached mazzo the first view which attracts everyone is the pool side arrangement as i am a hard core non vegetarian the live counters attracted me the most the macrail and pork were the best starters of the lot chef aritra was courteous enough to come and check for the taste of food he also ensured that my son gets to taste the non spicy foods such as japanese noodles and murtabak the cocktails served were also as per expectation
the buffet lunch was good but we all were full to taste them desert section attracted my son so we had few chocolate crossant and pastries
overall a great place to hang out with family and friends looking forward for evening visit now",5,
the food was very good and tasty though there were limited options in menu i liked the ambiance and service more best time to go would be in the evening,5,
"i will start off with what impressed me the most and go from there

service 55
i worked with nitin to host a wedding shower for my sister and brother in law with a guest list of 30 people nitin was so easy to talk to and tried his best to accommodate all my requests his staff was very courteous and even helped me when the decor team came to setup at the party they were attentive to all my guests and followed instructions well nitin even provided me with a speaker so i could play songs during the party there are a lot of things that could stress someone out when hosting a party but the location and the staff were not on that list it is a genuine relief that i had nitin and his team to help me

ambience 55
the location is perfect if you want to host a party take someone out on a date or just relax with your friends on a friday evening after work good aesthetics along with attention to detail makes this place what it is  the rooftop the pool the bar the lounge chairs by the pool the lighting at night the city views 

food 45
i created the food and drinks menu for my guests with help from nitin mazzo has a huge menu you can choose from if you are hosting a party i for one was confused with all the choices but nitin is suggestions were well received appetizers were amazing and main course was pretty good they even have the option of live stations  pasta mongolian chaat etc overall diverse options",5,
"went there for dinner with familyit is located just above sln terminus
must say it has a terrific ambience and decor especially loved the poolside view of the placebut the food is strictly average and their service is terribly slow and a big let down",3,
"absolutely stunning from their customer service ambience to food from the get go the manager nitin was helpful and assisted me in organizing an awesome couple shower for my sis and her partner they let us have the best spot by the pool let us decorate served us entree at the table and set up speakers for us play our own music their service was impeccable through out that night thanks mazzo  nitin for helping me to make it memorable for my sis and her now husband

i had great respect for marriott hotel but i lost everythig when i went their in my special day valentines day it was the most horrible experience  the service is very bad and they were harsh with the customers  i dint expect this from marriott hotel i dint think i will ever goto marriott again,1,
"of all the places i have ever been mazzo stands on the 2nd place with the amazing view of the city and open air dining area this place definitely leaves a great impression in people is mind variations within the available type of cuisines this is a place for everyone the service was fantastic the food was really amazing salads really melt in your mouth especially the woldrof salad a connoisseur will have no second thought in choosing this place as they say good food goes well with good wine you have a bar with a wide am variety of drinks people will love this place i say it is a bit pricey but hey good quality comes with a high price

thank you mazzo it was an amazing feeling to eat here",5,
reservation was confirmed on the phone multiple times as i was hosting a group of 20 people but we did not have a table when we reached i was told that i spoke to one employee but the other employee did not know so its not his responsibility i however contacted the hotel so not sure how i am supposed to inform all employees for a simple reservation it was quite an inconvenience because the whole group was made to stand for 15 mins and wait and move tables as well the staff was not apologetic either so we were quite disappointed this was a corporate booking with colleagues so we would not have expected this to happen,3,
the place has an amazing ambiance nice seating at rooftop beside the pool with amazing view and all 3 stars goes for it but the food is not great at all u can go there just to enjoy the view but food a big no the biriyani was very dry hardly any options for starters or desserts the staff were extremely courteous and srrvice was also okay,3,

"revised review

it was an absolute delight to be at mazzo the view is something worth looking forward to it is probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in hyderabad after a not so pleasant first encounter i decided to give it another attempt and boy this time it was definitely worth

we were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste soon after we were served with fried papad to nibble on and cranberry base mocktail to give some company the poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening

a little later the hot and sour soup arrived it was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later for starters we had veg manchurian and paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip the veg manchurian was a little more spicy but tasted good anyway and the paneer 65 was absolute perfection with the soft paneer cooked in real balanced masala

we then got in veg lasagne and veg biryani for main course the lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that i had earlier this had a very different taste i am not comparing in terms of better or worse just a very different taste and it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes winks the biryani as usual was good accompanied with this was the apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time i had a sip

the best was saved for the last although we were full to the brim i could not leave the beautiful rasmalai untouched and of course there is always a separate stomach for desserts so 

overall i had a lovely evening with my sister that day and i recommend it for dates or business dinners maybe even hangout with a friend or two you would have a sublime time regardless of who you are with



old review

overall rating  35

such a serene ambience if only it was accompanied by some good food me and my sister dropped by this place one evening i was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights we asked for the menu a couple times after which we finally got it the menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items like me you hardly have a choice we ordered in a subz shammi kebab to start with the staff took their own sweet time to serve it but it was toothsome which compensated for the delayed service i guess due to lack of options for drinks we settled for a salted lassi and a hot chocolate i do not want to go into much depth but well they werent great both the drinks had thin consistency we then went ahead with the vegetable biryani it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita but the quantity was less 

i am not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason but to be perfectly candid i do not think i would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food definitely not worthy enough",5,
i have been a regular here  mazzo evereybody that has ever accompanied has fallen in love with this place i would like to point out one special person sudhakar he is the chef a very polite and cordial gentleman exactly sets the mood by dishing out the most mouth watering smacking dishes i would like to give him 5 stars for making me every visit memorable,5,
really we enjoyed food here  thanks for amazing food  love to visted again and to have a tasty  thank you sudhar for your tasty food you provide,5,
awesome experience from the beginning amit and the manager was too customer centric they had a private party ongoing and they still took care of us very well my kid was feeling cold so they bought a shovel that was too kind zomato gold was accepted without any issues ordered long island ice tea which was perfectly mixed and margarita was awesome they served the buffet on the table while we were having our drinks they checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and tasty food lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday definitely going to recommend this place for perfect and tasty food thank you amit and the manager on duty,5,
"we loved the ambience to the fullest been here for my wife is birthday dinner pool side lovely ambience buffet dinner  what else you want
the buffet is simple and nice nothing so great about the variety but what ever they have  they are done well

amit and pratik helped us and made us feel home thanks guys appreciate

it is one of the best rooftop places in hyderabad wonderful ambience and pristine environment in addition to city view puts this place in a goto list the place has an amazing poolside outdoor sitting to offer,5,
3 stars only for the ambience of this place its amazing  for once you forget that its actually in the city zero stars to the food though we went for a sunday brunch limited menu and not so tasty food prawns were half cooked to my surprise drinks were good had apple martini which was really nice but there are better sunday brunches in hyderabad than this,3,
"the ambience is extremely beautiful and so are the service levels with the staff being healthily courteous and interactive
the chef is ever ready to customise the dishes to your liking
the drinks were below par in comparison to the other aspects of the place",4,
"starting with the ambience it has a warm indoor and a pleasant outdoor with a pool
polite staff
food of gd taste chicken biryani a must try 
very late service  takes around 20 minutes though the crowd is very less ",3,
till now its the best place for a perfect dinner date if you really have one  food i rate it at 35 as pasta we ordered was half cooked but quantity was better than my expectations,4,
a perfect date place to go open top pool view cool breeze and delicious food with your loved ones is a perfect combination prawns fry is at its best service is great and kind and special mention to arun who served us with patience,5,
"great ambiance with very poor service

food  355 the starters were just ok main course was a little better for the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case what disappointed most was the drinks even a classic margarita was not properly made it was orange is color and that is definitely not ok 

ambiance  55 it definitely stands out for its ambiance lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome one of the most beautiful ambiances among hyderabadi restaurants

service  25 this is where it is most disappointing you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you and after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city

price   35 it is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants but to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved

overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves",3,
nice place to spend with family great ambience warm welcoming great ambience of restaurants smiley faces quick service by service staff we will definitely come back to spent more time and same will suggest to my friends and family members,5,
"okay so finally i visited this amazing place i had heard so much of the view of the city is really mesmerizing during evenings the pool side view and the couple sitting area is one of their attractions

service is very slow which decreases their overall rating
food quality is good but not great you can try white sauce chicken pasta it will not disappoint you
ambiance is fantastic
it is a costly affair so pick up only you have something special to celebrate

35 rating overall best is the ambiance rest you can get find it anywhere else",5,

ordered food online horrible food full of spices and oil even after giving specific instructions not to make it spicy rotis were raw will not recommend to anyone,1,
there chicken mandi is the best in gachibowli very tasty and worth the money just that they provide very less mayonnaise on online orders  also it would be great if they could start a single piece version of the chicken mandi for people like me who live alone,5,
the restaurant did not feel hygienic at all there were house flies all over the tables were wiped but felt really old and unclean could not order or taste anything to write a neat review for the so said reasons,1,
"i am waiting for 25 mint staff this is eignor i tollk to not care i am regular customer

there are very few places where you get the original aroma and the taste of mandi and amongst them this is one excellent packaging and taste of the biryani hope this continues,5,
"green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in hyderabad they spread over hyderabad you will find any green bawarchi near your area

coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants they have crowd for taken away customers we had take many times

coming to dine here it is like any normal restaurant with basic interiors we have to wait 2530mins after order something we had grilled chicken butter chicken butter naan rumali roti and chicken biryani i like their chutney which comes with chicken biryani was nice but little spicy roti and butter naan both were fine

both delivery and food are good,5,
biryani tastes good service is little to improve will not say the best but better to go here if planning to eat biryani in gachibowli area,4,

this is the first place i experienced hyderabadi biryani i walked in and ordered a chicken briyani no big deal the cost was nearly the same as in chennai about 200 bucks i do not remember exactly but it was around 200 i was shocked when the waiter came with a big serving of briyani how big you ask two people could share it easily the taste was first class i for one can handle briyani as much as you think but i was stunned it is not the best briyani i have ever tasted but its my first hyderabadi biryani and i loved it such a great experience,5,

food here was good only hoping for better choices
i understand that providing buffet becomes a tedious task when everything has to be covered up under one roof so not complaining much
ambience wise the place does not have much to offer but the staff was the sweetest
there was this lady whose name i can not recall but she when i asked if i can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over she made them especially for me and delivered on table
that gesture made me like the restaurant better
ps they do not really serve on banana leaves ",4,

i had taken dinner buffet the ambience was good the food taste and dishes were below average everything was self service even the starter for veggie people is i would recommend not to go this restaurant as they do not have items in paneer and mushroom in veg apart from this they had dishes like egg burji egg curry rajma masala plain ricenot even fried rice bhendi fry etc such dishes gave me a feeling that i am dining in a roadside dhabatapri coconut barfi ice cream was not at all special and seemed to be of low quality the pastries tasted as if they are preserved since many days overall i would say the buffet is a waste of money in this restaurant,2,

damn too much oil i can make another curry out of it that much,1,
good taste but less spicy,3,
too much salt,3,
the last time i went to this restaurent the food was not so good as it was very salty and service was also very slow i called the waiter to change my dish as it was very salty he didt change it he just modified it and gave it back then i called him again for the same reason then he finally got it replaced and gave me the new dish that was also pathetic nevervisit,1,
i ordered butter chicken but got paneer,1,
food delivered was of very bad quality,1,
super starters like it very much,5,
not good this time,2,
"this place is a good place to go out with your family food quality and ambience is quite good enough for its pricethey welcome everyone with a complimentary drink which is a quite warm gesture here you can go for a economical buffet meal with your friends and family alsoit is a place you can visit and dine out without a pinch in your wallet
cheers",4,
rate is a bit on the higher side,3,
average food,3,
"this outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd

the ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space it was well lit but could really deck up a few notches it was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant

upon arrival were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation we were asked if we are here for buffet the restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet i had a look at the menu and it did not interest me

the manager at this place was a nice fellow who carefully took our order of dragon chicken punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan after a fair bit of waiting time we are served with dragon chicken

i would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry so that the flavours stick to the chicken it was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation

the servers need to be taught a little bit about serving they were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers

then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan simply put it was a disaster the curry was as bland as it could be most restaurants in this part of india assume that all dishes of punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief we could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own it was just sitting there doing nothing neither it was spicy not it was tangy it was going nowhere

the problem here does not lie with the chefs it lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do they say they are multi cuisine but multi cuisine does not mean you can make disaster dishes and pass them off i am not a fan of multi cuisine when you have such a title you should at least try to make it work for you the restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant north indian population or the traditional south indian population

one thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their buffet menu they tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion

had the restaurant been a traditional southern one i would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content

the restaurant needs to find its footing the owners need to decide which way they want to go maybe hire some traditional north indian guys for north cuisine

good ambiencegood spread buffet for dinner yesterday nighthighly dissapointed about the vegetarian curries which were rottened 2 out of three were rottened the triple pudding in the deserts with rottened fruits was pathetic overall vegetarian food for the buffet was ignored by the restaurant pls do takecare bananaleaf do not dissapoint your customers,2,
the worst biryani and tandoori i ever had looked like some leftover is delivered to me and so expensive idiots,1,
i frequently visit this place only for lunch buffet good food budget friendly family restaurant love there desserts and ice creams can give it a try,4,
average taste,3,
food items got intermixed due to improper packing,4,
worst food,1,
approach to the hotel could have been better on the top floor of an old building with smelly ground floor location could have been better not very visible from the outside lift could have been better pretty old lift not sure if it passes safety norms ambience inside the restuarant could have been better doesnot give you a good vibe thats about the appearance and appeal spread was decent for a discounted price of 400 per person inclusive of all taxes food was ok as well i could see a lot of smiling faces familes and that sums it all if food is good then nothing else should matter i guess,3,
delivery very late more than 30 min,3,
the worst biryani i ever had in my life till date i am sure kritunga biryani tastes good hope this is zomato fault they have delivered me a local biryani instead kritunga theres no kritunga cover when i got it it was packed in a normal cover the worst exp i had today,1,
nice food good value for money the food is much spicy as u like it most it is quality and food smells very nice the package also very neat and strong,5,
a complete and absolute disaster the place where we sat was dirty there were cracks on the walls we ordered the food to be less spicy but i guess they cook how they want to cook the ac was nonexistent it felt like we were sitting in a tandoor the service was pretty slow  if you bring food you bring the starters together and then you do not put a gap in between the starters and the main course the taste was appalling subpar service being in one of the prime locations i have ordered a lot of times from kritunga madhapur and that one is very good i think kritunga gachibowli has a long way to go before it becomes worth the money wish them the best,1,
"i had ordered chicken dum biriyanithere is no chicken dum inside it also the chicken pieces are very small in size  i would also suggest to work on your food packaging

i have been to other kritunga is many times since 6 years and never was disappointed ragi sankati one of the benchmark dishes served by kritunga was bad and i am hesitating to use the word worst pulavs werent good either keema pulao was below average and veg pulao was not properly cooked after receiving the order and started eating waiter says they ran out of soft drinks which we ordered if kritunga really consider reading these reviews i would like to quote a statement  kritunga you are just selling your brand but not good food anymore,1,
"ordered veg biryani it is like rice mixed with red chilli powder not even tasty never order it

3rice qaulity is very pooooorlooks like is a normal ricesonamasuri instead it has to be basmathi rice
4taste is worst looks like fried rice",1,
"only masala is der in biryani tooooo much spicy am seeing dis from 3times i ordered but same like diz only they r giving wrost biryani ",1,
one of the most staisfying biryani is in the city you will definitely pop water from your eyes when you eat this freaking biryani especially the pot thingwell situated at dlf which is few metres away from majority of it companies so visit when you get a chance,4,
"i had ordered food from kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place oncegachibowli the ambience here is good and the staff was attentive
the steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry it was very delicious i also tried gongura chicken it was fine apart from these i tried spl chicken biryani kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery overall i would say the food here is good a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies
packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order it would great if the food could be packed in boxes",3,
the restaurant is not hygiene all houseflies around the staff especially the receptionist was rude when asked about the hygiene even if you order food they do not provide basic stuff like plastic spoon along with food totally disappointed with this restaurant,1,
"reasonable

while going healthy and done with enough of biryanis it was time for ragi muda ordered one ragi muda the quantity was good properly boiled and happy to satisfy me have gone with many orders from this place

also visited their restaurant in madhapur branch and must say am very happy with the service food and ambiance

they have given it a old town look butter and tandoori naan were amazing with the butavankay curry thick and 3 pieces of brinjal in it little spicy but absolutely homely food is what i can say about this place

again ragi muda is my all time favorite from here no doubt the chutney served with it is deadly spicy but again you ask for some more ghee or take another curry",4,
for vegetarians they have amazing ragi sangati rice like ball made of ragi and vangkayabrinjal made in coconut and nut gravy the veg biryani was ok but my group really liked the chicken biryani recommended if you are looking for andhra cuisine,4,
"they serve with hot and you can order spicy or less spicy what you want  it is very taste  spicy natu kodi and mutton biriyani is very taste ",4,
very bad service people just roam around not even one gives a menu or takes order few do not know what is in menu tables are not clean onion places got others finger prints with food,1,
over hyped placeno neatness they open branches in hot places so that they will get the customers no matter whatespecially this dlf branch is no where preferable,2,
random visit to near by restaurant but fully satisfied very tasty i would love to visit again n recommend others too spicy ambiance starters main course all together all 5 from my end if you love spicy food give a try,5,
had been here many times becz its nearer to ma place if u want to eat very spicy biryani i say that u must visit kritunga all items here are known for their spicyness but ambience wont be that much classy but one can go if it is not an issue for them,4,
i have been in kritunga it was awesome i have ordered keema biryani it was delicious i give 5rating for services it is perfect for family and others,4,
awesome spicy starters and biryani paya was like soup but not thick with spicy peppers biryanis varieties are good and they are with spicy touch kunda biryani is my favorite here,4,
irrespective of their high reputation of being authentic andhra food restaurant i was highly disappointedtasted kheema biryani which was not upto the markthe service was slow ambiance was ok,2,
i have ordered khema biryani and chicken roast both of them were not good khema biryani was too bad i have visited kondapur branch many times and i liked the food but this time i had a very bad experience,2,
food was bad the paneer pieces in biryani taste is worst not satisfed,3,
"expect qty is slightly low ",4,
"the famous restaurant for rayalseema cuisine  food was great service was bit slow for my liking  ambience was ok  pricing was reasonable ",4,
4,4,
very good ambience good food and very friendly staff comparing to all kritunga restaurants this is the best one which i found especially place thank you,5,
"food was okay  strictly south indian food northies do not try unless you are sure u want to eat pure south indian food  45 for spicy ",2,
very less chicken piecec in chiken biryani very spice its like red mirchi rice no flavour of biryani worst biryani ever very much unsatisfied,1,
"it was supposed to be nellore fish pulusu what i got delivered tasted only like fish and warm water no salt no spices no chillies just some pieces of fish and put into coloured warm water worst fish curry i had ever ",1,
o,5,
been here for a casual dinner the food was good and fresh although it was spicier than expected it was compensated by the rich flavours the service was great this place was very welcoming and the prices were reasonable one thing that won my heart was their choice of music they played refreshing telugu songs which went perfectly with the occasion,4,
is that what oder fry pieces biryani no one will speak that it is fry pieces biryani it is a chicken curry with only onions,1,
pathetic  very small and loud no proper starters and every other menu was not available may be it was our wrong selection of restaurant it is not a multicusine restaurant,1,
"not at all satisfied with the food
order was for fried piece chicken biryani received normal chicken biryani with bones and quantity of food was also very less
asked for solution was not provided
poor service in online way",2,
delivery good,5,
no chicken pieces in it,1,
too spicy,4,
not upto the mark,1,
nice delivery boy good communicationsuper,5,
super but costly,5,
food is superbut so spicy,4,
worst biriyani ever had there was some small pieces of chicken curry dry placed over some rice i do not know whether you have learnt atleast how biriyani looks like even after being in the city of biriyanis that it is not just some pieces of chicken kept over a lump of basmati rice pls grow up no 0 option,1,

afood is not as per recipe so you guys do not name it as per the area like nellore fish pulusu before naming it just find the traditional recipesi am from nellore i know how tasty the food isjust for marketing purposes do not use the names for the dishes,1,
"yesterday i was here with my two friends it was raining and weather was amazing the best fusion food i could ever eat it is a must go place guys i would rather say best place for romantic couples good view ambience of the restaurant good yummy yummy food and silent music the manager and people who were serving here are so polite and humble to suggest food and drinks i would like to visit again soon
",5,
i liked the food very much the best part is the ambience of it you cannot ask for a better one in hyderabad it is so peaceful and one could spend hours sitting there we had a hard time finding parking spot as the parking is full other than that i loved this place and would go there again and again,4,
the ambience was very calm and soothing great view from the outdoor deck service was prompt by our server mr anup food was absolutely delicious i recommend this place to try,4,
"it is a great place for a quiet dinner and ambience is lovely but the food was a disappointment
the place does not feel like we are inside the noisy city which is absolutely delightful but i wish i could say the same about the food and drinks
staff is courteous and serving time is excellent you do not have to wait for your food or drinks for more than 1015 mins no matter what you order
ambience 55
staff 455
food 15",3,
"surprisingly the sunset was an eye fiest evenings can be well spent feels like not in the city anymore quite peaceful and lovely ambience 
food is little disappointing though chicken is not at all spicy but the apricot delight is a must try
gohave the most of the place with an apricot delight is what i can give 55 ",3,
this was place was a surprise as it is better than you imagine though it turned out to be a bit hot the air circulation could have been better the food and drinks were as how they were described must try,4,
"the glass onion is located at a calm and a quiet place despite being around a km behind infosys the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you neednt be bothered about finding a place for parking while the restaurant does offer valet but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there

once you enter the restaurant you are floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected they have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements owing to the summers we opted for indoor seating the tables are well spaced and there is enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience

the servers are well groomed attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference for starters we ordered lotus stem galouti kebab and nachos the kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste the nachos were light crispy and had good amount of toppings despite nachos being one of the common starters i would still recommend people to try the ones here

for the main course we ordered the lahori paneer combo that gets served with a small bowl of dal makhni and naanpulao the paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the paneer the dal makhni that came along with the paneer was out of this world it is a pity that it does not get served separately but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same for something that is prepared so well i feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu

finally the dessert tiramisu pastry simply no words right amount of sweetness well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee after a good dinner the tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers

one small observation that i would still like to add is that despite a good number of servers they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it however considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there i wouldnt penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits",5,
"truly a hidden gem this place is situated far from the city inside emaar courtyard the have both indoor and outdoor seating and the ambience is the best part about this place its just amazing
the food was also great something that good be improved is the customer service there is a bit of delay in getting the orders
top picks 
 mint cooler
 chicken bbq pizza

the ambience will offset the price you pay overall a must visit place",5,
"this place looks really nice with some good music they have both outdoor and indoor seating facility and it is a best place to hangout with the family and friends outdoor seating has an amazing view of the golf ground and can be enjoyed during evening

they welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice
first we ordered screw driver tropical delight and mint cooler which was really good

screw driver  it was a cocktail which contains vodka and orange juice

tropical delight  it had orange pineapple mango and cream which taste differently i personally liked that blend but my friends did not i would rate 385

mint cooler  it is just normal virgin mojito what we gets in other places as well nothing special was not their 355

for starters we ordered lotus stem galouti which was ok ok the kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more 345

next we ordered bbq roasted chicken pizza which was good the pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen but that was covered by the taste 45

overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends

overall  465",5,
the place was in a very high end location the ambience was not up to the mark the service seemed pretty hostile when we asked them basic questions and when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food they did not seem too happy about it the appetizers and soup were good but the quantity was too little we ordered the classic mezeh platter and when asked for some pita bread the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response overall the place is overpriced and the service needs to be improved,2,
"visited glass onion a month back the restaurant is very close to office inside premises of emmar boulder hills we went with office colleagues on a celebration treat

ambience was really good we had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience

food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size we ordered mediterranean platter bruschetta for vegetarians the mocktails were nice

it was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served what really impressed me was that they followed rules that is really good to see

for main course we ordered a north indian combo a very customised pasta and couple more things they tasted good deserts were good but served delayed

overall nice experience",4,
place is cozy peaceful and beautiful food is 455 ambiance 55 service 455 good place to visit with family friends or team we tried their special nachos 5 spice chicken kebab and atishi murg tikka,5,
"2 stars for the place for rest 3 need good food service presentation and experience

lets start with the good part for which the two stars

ambience  location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd the rain today made it even better outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe

thats it to the place and good part

service was bad food was ok if a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem buying water is a choice not force does not matter if you are local udipi or a five star we were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy while leaving we did see other tables served normal water

we did have zomato gold to use but the experience was not so great to use it first turnoff  dont have kingfisher beers

we ordered veg tandoor platter margherita pizza  tiramisu and cheesecake

pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 355 generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count we asked for mustard and denied

the platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side extra chutney took forever to come

tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

cheesecake was pretty bad packed to throw i guess the blueberry on it is red color which is super confusing the creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard

they gave a birthday brownie which frankly was average too however the server comes and tells me during payment i have not charged you for brownie wtf

overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar",2,
"a classy place with fantastic ambiencethe decor was lovely a perfect place with indoor and outdoor seating options ordered chicken wings which were perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavours infused tempura prawns were okay can give it a miss lotus stem galouti kabab mildly spiced well cooked and melts in the mouth ordered chettinad chicken indian tray it was amazing sundried tomatoes chicken pasta was made perfectly ordered goey chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and tiramisu both of them were perfect

the best pizza i have ever had  you will fall in love with the space a perfect place for romantic dinners and desserts you would crave them even later with the thought of them though the food is a bit expensive  it is all worth it,5,
nice place to hangout with friends light dj music good variety of fruit beverages margherita pizza is a must try chicken wings chicken risotto and cheese broccoli,4,
"a memorable experience would be the right caption for my recent dining experience with this restaurant staff was very courteous  proactive special mention ankit  vishal the restaurant has breathtaking views of the golf course around the interior designing is another remarkable thing to notice
last but not the least  the food
i can still recall the tempting taste left on my tastebuds while stepped out that night
must visit m definately coming back",5,
"i went there with my office colleagues the ambience is good the music played is little loud may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking

about food quality of food is good but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes all those to be served at same time what happens was we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food

we ordered lotus stem galouti the taste of galouti was good but keeping one small kulcha was not going well i know it must be an experiment but i guess it is not working out as it was not going well with galouti

so overall good for one time",3,
i really like this place and i have been there multiple times the best part is the ambience which is just really classy you can bring your date here as they have that kind of a romantic ambience on game nights you can watch live screenings of the matches too they also have 22 on drinks for zomato gold members which is really nice to have as well,5,

talk about a perfect date night and the glass onion is the best decision to go for with amazing music perfect view of the golf course beautiful seating arrangements and sophisticated ambience made the night worth remembering the new york cheesecake with blueberry sauce was good but i will not deny that i have tasted better cheesecakes before we ordered one pizza which was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter i apologize i do not remember his name but he definitely needs some appreciation i remember he said he was from delhi and also kolkata who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert this definitely made our night because it tasted so good the menu might be little overpriced according to many but for us with smart selection of dishes it was not a hole in the pocket overall it was an outstanding visit a small suggestion if they could include candle diningthat would elevate the romantic ambience of the place,5,
"great feel great ambianceterrible customer serviceu need a mesh and anti mosquito repellents asapwould not really want to be back after such an experience here

good ambience and great staff

there were mosquitoes in the restaurant the food was ok but there was a hygiene concern the pickled carrot was stale and had fungus the waiter replaced it but this is not expected of such a high profile restaurant,2,
the food is decent but the place and service is extremely horrible went there for dinner with my family and we were bombarded with mosquitoes all around us even though we were sitting indoors called the manager for this situation and was told that they can not do anything about it brilliant customer service,1,
avoid this place in summer due to outside seating they do not even have coolers in such weather outside and it is an expensive place not worth,1,
we visited the restaurant yesterday we got outside table as all insides were reserved being 42 degrees outside they only had fans running in such upscale restaurant and mist fans they are charging 1400 rs for buffet and is considered upscale restaurant quite amazed on how upscale restaurants cannot afford coolers felt bad for waiters also as they were fully sweating and running aroundi had same experience few months back we went in th evening and it rained we took the outside seating due to nice weather plus all the water was gushing inside and they had nothing to prevent that i liked the food here but if management can not simply think abt service i am sure we can figure out other places to eat,2,
"why glass onion  this place was trending on zomato ever since it has openned and it has gained the popularity in very short span of time so i was having an eye on it and finally felt delighted after visiting it at saturday night

ambience  oh wobby  beautify ambience with indooroutdoor sitting options and spread accross huge space its situated inside the boulder hills and hence the area is very peaceful and calm you need to have a reservation for outdoors as this place is mostly filled with people

service  food  super fast service and sumptous food period
from kung pow chicken  cheese based brocolli to nachos to chicken chettinad  everything is lovely and you can go on asking more and more

yay or nay  ",5,

can improve your main course and desserts spread i would have rated 3 but i am giving a 1 because one of your servers behavior was bad in our office party when my friend asked for a blue lagoon he insulted him in front of everybody by saying that blue lagoon is for kids not men just because it is a soft drink one need not believe in others beliefs and customs but at least respect them and not insult them train your staff appropriately,1,
fantastic ambience and great service location is a must visit over seeing the golf course the food was great and meats quality was just superb will be a regular here,5,
"first time experience at this place was very good nice ambience right from entry to the different seating areas offering different kind of ambiences the food we ordered was also tasty we had the veg mezze platter and kungpao chicken as starters both were well made though quantity could have been a little more for the price they charge
the main course was a custom made ravioli pasta in mixed sauce which was very good and a stir fry veg udon noodles

they can improve on service a bit as no one bothered to serve us foodnot even first time

would like to go back again to enjoy the outdoor ambience next time where they played loud musicbut looked like a good place to relax",4,
"awesome food great ambience best service

we went in a group and tried a lot of things on their menu everything was unique and best cocktails were decent stallion stood out of all",5,
"i will start off by talking about it is ambience and location which i believe and am sure most will agree are it is highlights located inside the serenity of boulder hills away from the hullabaloo of the busy city it offers a sense of calm the simple yet elegant decor  is what clicked for me right from the moment i walked in it has both and indoor and outdoor sitting the indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit i would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer the streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it  definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink i visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least now coming to the food and beverages part definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all vip locality  the cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu and yes they have a novel concept of high tea served along with alcoholic beverages  which is served during the early hours of the evening 47 pm  with the set up they have i believe this is a must try overall it is a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening  with family or friends

ps do not go there looking for dance and high pitch music you might be disappointed",4,
"i do not see how this place can be rated anything other than 5 stars
food ambience and service is awesome there is no comparison to this place in hyderabad

i have been served by ani he takes care of customers and suggests great choices from the menu

personal favourites  broccoli cheese kebab non veg kebab platter mezze platter",5,
"all great except the staff the service is quite poor and they made a lot of fuss about using zomato gold
lots of mosquitoes staff will not care to put some mosquito repellant either",1,
"as far as date nights are considered there is music lovely ambience tables over looking a golf course and of course some rains to give you respite from the hot summer this was my dinner night with naina at glass onion a beautiful restaurant at boulder hills hyderabad the best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in hyderabad

let is take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates the beer battered fish was soft and finely fried lovely textures i must tell pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza called four cheese pizza yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it a classic wood fired pizza flocks

the penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables and i must say i forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in it was delicious and completely uplifted the mood we surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya the stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic make sure to use your zomato gold in good use here

the cherry on top was apple pie our parting order such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream we surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find for couples to have a romantic dinner

"what a beautiful place to go for dinner with family or friends headed to this place either friends for dinner and also for a special occasion

there is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place we chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather

there is quite a large selection of food from italian continental to indian we ordered for some starters from which we really like bakchoy fry and also malai broccoli chilli potato and red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup i would definitely suggest hi for broccoli soup for the main course we ordered some white sauce pasta grilled chicken with lemon butter garlic sauce vegetarian fried rice and my favorite pork spare ribs which was just scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork we also ordered a cheese platter with wine and i would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine

we had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it is really not that expensive and it is totally worth it for the view and for the food

a very serene beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy a beautiful evening",5,

would have given 35",4,
"so this place is in boulder hills and is spread across a huge area and the interiors is what one would love to go here for

"i visited this place with my exroommate after 10 months
low crowd made us feel even more comfortable
attractive and romantic ambience
tasty food and very much reasonable

if you are a pasta lover then do order white sauce pasta
it tasted incredibly hot and yummy
as we visited this place for lunch we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste
we wrapped up having sea salt nutella dessert which was heaven of nutella and different taste
in recent times i have never been to such a good place with decent crowd and tastyyyy food

"amazing ambience whole experience was great 
will come back again for breakfast loved the view outside rice bowls are a must try broccoli veg starter can be skipped",4,
"visited the place on a saturday  we had reservations made for 8pm and reached at around 820pm only to receive a disapproving look by the lady and were told that it is difficult to hold a table this long the entrance gave a deserted look and we were thinking why is this female so arrogant thereafter we got to know the real story as we moved towards the seating area the place was well lit with a posh ambience perfect seating and tranquil yet charming environment really loved the idea of the hanging plants amidst the lights
we ordered lotus stem galauti kebab kung paw chicken teriyaki mushroom the starters were delicious especially the chicken beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises
ordered stir fried udon noodles for main course although a bit oily it was tasty full of vegetables  the dark brownie ordered as desert was mouth watering the taste lingers

the staff is courteous and the vallet very kind and amazing person 
all in all a good experience ",4,
great food reasonably priced and situated in good location had lamb and pasta quality and quantity was great we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for the food people coming for lunch would enjoy the golf course view a must try for foodies,5,
with the view of golf course and selection between wide variety of delicious dishes this is one of the best place to hang out perfect for a sunset view as well,5,
"beautiful indoor and outdoor sitting delicious food
we ordered ravioli pasta which was a show stopper
nachos pizza and few of their mocktails
everything was just perfect  infact i have been to this place earlier and have to say they never disappoint  a big thumbs up only down vote for the place being a bit pricy would rate it as 45",4,
"if you are searching for a place with great ambience golf course view with a pleasent sit out area then this place is a perfect match we had non veg platter veg platter  classic chicken burger  this tasted yum pathari ghosh bangok spicy rice bowl non veg  interesting and a tasty treat however there are fewer options for veg and menu can be improved

mocktails very not upto mark and definetly not worth the amount you pay for any of those options as were any other items so please note that its a pricey affair service was as usual nothing much to be praised about overall

it is a must try place in hyderabad located in boulder hills this place is spacious and has a golf course in vicinity the usp of the place is definitely the ambience the large open area and also the pricey bar counter stacked with expensive liquor ideal place for a romantic candlelit dinner the place reverberates the screech of birds at night and the experience is surreal we ordered pizza and chicken wings and a couple of drinks food was average but the ambience is mind blowing,4,

super food and fantastic service by vishal he was extremely courteous and helpful the ambience of the restaurant was out of the world  very serene,5,
"it was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place i reserved a table for us on the same day itself to start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had i was delighted to see the place at first contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us after reserving the table and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner like local restraunts and they gave us the menu the waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said i would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side the food was not worth the price it tasted more like any other local restraunt the starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice i would say the butter chicken tasted very bland it was sweet and barely had any flavour seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us overall a bad experience




verdict  on the face of itthe ambience was nice the service and food were not upto the mark very dissappointing indeed",1,
"when i entered the place i was impressed with the interiors and how huge the place was what i really liked about the place was that it has a good veg menu as well we had ordered for a mac n cheese steak i felt all the items on the plate were dry items be it the grilled vegetables or the patty or the pulao rice there should have been some kind of gravy or dip with these items or else the dish tasted good we had also ordered for a spaghetti aglio olio so the spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we did not really like how it tasted when we informed the management about the spaghetti they immediately changed it with spinach ravioli the ravioli tasted really nice the rich garlic flavour of this dish with pine nuts was a perfect blend

over all the experience was a really nice definitely a must visit",4,

"vegetarian review 

hopped in on a day before holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day survived with food that day it is on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great this is the best place to be light music playing through the night was soothing

we ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha korean waffle fries veg penne alfredo pasta and apple pie

lotus stem galouti  the galouti tasted great with the flavours of vegetables and did not taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha

waffle fries  the waffle had lot of honey sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste the waffle was not crispy and the did not was not that great for my taste buds

alfredo pasta  the pasta was creamy and had all the veggies the consistency was good and it tasted well overall

apple pie  this was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling

the staff is good and friendly i remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice keep up the good service the whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good

overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation ideal for romantic dates and celebrations the whole embience is calm and peaceful and makes it best among all theglassonion",4,

the glass onion hope it belongs to global by what i have seen there this place is built located exactly beside a golf course the inside is just neat and calm the food served is as good as their service a calm alcoholic evening spent there is just astonishingly peaceful in the middle of the busy it hub,4,
i have been to this for saturday night dinner the ambiance and the locality makes it a pleasant sit out with lush greens and golf court all around the only thing which disappointed me is the service which was very very slow and the response was not up to the mark,3,
ambience is great so is the food service is very fast serving people are very polite and are easily approachable food taste is great their location in zomato is showing incorrect it would be good if there are some directions put up on the road it was not easy to find through the map i would definitely visit again,4,

i had heard a lot about glass onion but came back extremely disappointed the only reason i have given it 2 stars is because of the nice staff and the gorgeous ambience the food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less we ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had one piece of lasagna which really shocked me then we had the chicken steak which was decent  nothing special we gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts we ordered the warm apple pie cheesecake and the brazilian chocolate cremeux the chocolate dessert tasted old the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness but the warm apple pie was very good overall never coming here again and do not recommend to anyone,2,

we went there to celebrate my husband is birthday given the ratings we saw however the restaurant did not live up to the high expectations considering the average food and slow service the staff was courteous though as we did not like our tomato soup and they were prompt enough to take it back honestly the replaced one was not much of a relief either would recommend there to go for the evening view with friends for few drinks but do not expect mu h beyond that,3,

food and service everything is good but not able to avail zomato gold at the end of dining vishal srikanth manager and vishawanath waiter everybody befooled that we can use zomato gold at the end but then it gets closed,1,
the service is shit the waiter asked us not avail zomato gold at the beginning of the order but to avail at the bill time but gold was not available but to compensate no discount was given  disappointing experience,1,

"despite having a prior booking  they made us sit in the last where the ac was not sufficient 
the management was too ignorant  said the same thing multiple times all to deaf ears 
there is nothing that was too good about it
the food was below average and too pricy for the portion and taste they serve
will not recommend",1,

the pasta alone is too good to fetch the high rating the service is another reason for it i would definitely like to have many more visits to try out other items in their menu card,4,
"i have been there here thrice the food is simply amazing but it is too costly
must try  crispy corn  cheesy french fries  deli 9 spl pizza and munchuria noodles lunch combo

"nice ambience wonderful service but not so wonderful food
ordered the thai green curry was just a watery mess probably the worst ever had
kung pao chicken was overly sweet the noodles were just tossed around in a few eggs and probably 2 pieces of chicken
the rice was very dry giving us an overall average experience",2,
had ordered veg lasagna and enchilada for home delivery the lasagna was good but after taste wad not that great enchilada was more like an indian preparation could be better,3,

so every time we go we use zomato zomato code which one of the best option here but last time when i went they have removed it since the contract is over 

wish you deli9 team should consider zomato again which will allow to enjoy more food and suggest other  totally a good experience

this is such a default place that if you cannot make your mind come over here and till now they have never dizappointed food is good service is fast and you have a good time,5,
nice and cozy place to hang outprofessional servicedishes were pretty awesome tooloved the fish n chipsveg lasagna was quite delicious must try more dishes definitely a place u can visit more often,4,
had a very disappointing experience the place did not do justice to it is rating i do not know what happened maybe the chef had a bad day or maybe that is how the food generally is ordered fries with cheese which was poorly seasoned the fish in fish and chips was literally dripping in oil there did not seem any effort put into the potato wedges that come on the side of the burger the service was good if only food was half as decent,2,
"among all the dishes i have tried there cottage steak was the one which stood well for me they serve this with cottage tikki barbecue sauce which was going really well in combo
veg burger was just fine not really worth trying",3,
liked the ambience and the presentation of the food more of a formal place  tried fish fry chicken lasagna rice bowl mongolian chicken garden veg pizza the taste was good,4,
we were not that hungry so we ordered veggie 9 burger and veg shawarma wrap and they were good service was pretty quick and ambience was nice,5,
"i had been to this place after long time last night for dinner i must say the ambience is still so marvelous each wall has something interesting by itself a great place for photography coming to the food we ordered
1 bull frog
2 fanta
3 pepper chicken bao
4 ginger chicken bao
5 fish and chips
6 cajun chicken breast sizzler

the bao is are a must try both of them were yummy fish and chips were in the same category as well but this time the fish was not that great coming to the sizzleri felt chicken was a little hard and the veges needed a pinch of salt a little bland for my taste other than that everything was good",4,
a very cool place to hang around i am a fan of their food and beverages they will not disappoint you with any of their dishes i think their mocktails and coffee menu should grow now having the same standard stuff will become monotonous for regular customers because they are not very great however their soups and desserts are to die for overall i always had a good experience at this place staff is friendly and patient but not good at suggesting you what to order d,4,
"the ambience of the place was great and the food was really amazingwe had delicious alfredo pasta and chicken sizzler though felt the price was a bit on the higher side it was worth the taste and experiencethumps up deli 9 bistro ",4,
food is good and ambiance too just that we ordered for pasta for my kid with no spice and it was loaded with black pepper which was not a pleasant experience staff is a bit rude may be because they are not well staff,3,
"amazing nachos and a really good tenderloin burger
the ambience is really nice and cozy service is quick and polite
veg menu is limited and a few more starter will be great",4,
i generally get my food delivered from this place kung pao chicken rice bowl is my favourite from this place it is served with veg fried rice not so spicy you can have it daily if you like  i have also tasted fish n chips from this place the menu is bit pricy but tasted good,4,
"i recently visited here for lunch with my office team mates  the food was really good and the staff were polite and quick to respond the ambience was pretty pleasing too

one issue with this place is that the parking area is really really cramped it is small and since it is shared with the other eateries in the same building parking your car can be a bit of a headache here",4,
one good place to hangout in financial district ambience is good and food is tasty  tried pasta and chilli peppers rice bowl additionally zomato gold works,4,

"this place is very nearby to my house and i order from here a lot of times mostly i have tried pasta here almost all varieties and all of it was good thai curry dish was also above average cute place to hangout ",4,
this place is gold if you want a good dining experience in financial district amid all the star hotels and big names this place has made its mark it is not cheap but thats fine considering the portions they serve and taste you will be done with one burger or a riceroti with a curry zomato gold comes to your rescue if you have one i like simple chicken burger and lemonade burger come with some potato wedges salad,5,
deli9 has a lots of good food to offer and that is why i flock the place pretty frequently my favorite here is their pan fried fish steak sizzler if you are not a fan of sizzlers request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well but it did not live upto the expectations it was dry and chewy sadly their pastas are quite tasty we tried ours in pink sauce so are their pizzas we tried garden veg if you like fish and chips try it out here will not be disappointed their cold coffee is not that great bitter and watery i like the creamy and balanced kind if you like mocktails i would suggest that you leave out the ginger lime fizz it is a poor version of our limca the mojitos here are pretty refreshing though,4,
tried the chicken stuffed steak and the fish steak which were genuinely impressive not only were the waiters friendly they had fast service as well with the zomato gold membership i could avail the 1  1 offer which destroyed my hunger pangs,5,
"when you hunt for nice place and meet folks who are just busy in their own it is a let down

staff really needs to pickup on the service and behavior
not at all a nice experience
food saved this place the 3 star coz it was tasting decent not great again

not willing to visit again would give 25 if had a choice",3,
this is a good place to dine the food is really good although there is not so much that you can order the ambience is really nice just giving 5 star because me and my friends just love the aloo 65 pulav,5,
"been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers pizzas and grilled chicken my all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and texmex burger it is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors i would highly recommend the texmex burger delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite their pizzas are also taste worthy despite being a nonvegetarian i really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings 

besides the food their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday

highly recommended if you are in the area near wipro circle gachibowli

have visited deli 9 many times with good experiences but this particular time did not have the same i ordered singaporean prawns for starters as i was using zomato gold the waiter insisted a place orders for both the dishes together which i have not heard anywhere before after some question the waiter agreed the quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee overall the service disappointed me but its a good shot for some good food,3,

excellent place with very good ambiance great food and especially love the fact their portions are meant for one person so everyone can order what they want punjab putter and thai curry are a must have,5,

i do not think they understand the ingredients of the type of coffee that you ordercoz i had asked for a strong cappuccino and what was offered was more on the terms of a milky latte

the food well i had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayishi do not know how the keema pav tasted though

all in all this place is not that great when you compare with other cafes in the town",3,
amazing burgers and pizzas ambience was good we have tasted a chicken burger and tex mex lamb burger both are very tasteful pizza was good too,5,
had a very disappointing experience here today we had been eyeing this place since long and planned our brunch to be had here loved the place it was spacious and the ambiance was really good the first thing i ordered was coffee but they were not serving any hot beverages next wanted to try pizza as they serve in different shapes but that too was unavailable did not felt like ordering anything after this highly disappointed,2,

so last time i went here and we ordered chicken lasagna and singaporean prawns also cold coffee not in picture

staff is polite and well trained service is prompt and ambience is great",4,
food tastes good however had bad experience with freshness of food being served happened once at eating out at restaurant and second time while ordered home delivery,2,
we ordered cape ground chicken lasagne along with garlic and chilli spiced chicken pizza both the dishes were awesome the minced chicken in the lasagne was perfectly cooked the pizza had a thin crust and good flavors to top it off they have zomato gold offer as well,5,

the food is the best part about the place inspite of offering multiple cuisines ranging from thai to italian to continental to indian and lebanese they seem to get the balance perfectly right",4,
i had a nice dinner planned with my wife here i have had lunch many times at this place but that evening was special we got a cockroach along with the meal when complained the only thing they offered was to replace the dish,2,
burger was delicious so was the lemonade drinkfirst time used zomato goldthe ambience was also goodwould love to come back againmoreover it is near my working place,5,
"i visited this place on a weekday in the evening to have a snack
 ambience was good service was prompt and responsive
 i ordered pineapple lemonade cheesy fries and chicken burger
liked the cheesy fries with mustard sauceand burger
overall good place to hangout and have a snack will visit this place again ",4,
this place never disappoints me never totally love the nachos chaat in the starters prepared warm crispy with right dose of sour and sweet flavours paav bhaji is also very good in main course their paneer bhurji combo is my all time favourite also must try is lasagna at this place byw i love how they give you good quantity of food as well the staff is super courteous,5,
good place to have quick food to satisfy your taste buds been there couple of times with some friends every time the food is good and service is prompt,4,
the ambiance of the restaurant is very spacious and good the service is very fast before you know you order is on your table must be very careful about the  quantity of the dishes we went for green peas veg soup it was delicious  and heartfilling in the main course we went for punjab puttar veg it was delicious and sufficient for 3 people we went for a fish main it was a very very spicy and a huge disappointment our overall experience was good but not great,4,
have been to this place many times and have tried different dishes never had a bad experience they do not have many dessert options though which is a little disappointing,4,
lol i paid 345 bucks for what tasted like ready made pasta without any salt in it along with a tiny flaky piece of bread that had neither butter nor garlic wrapped in aluminium foil i have seen more effort from places that charge 200 bucks for a dish it was bad i counted three pieces of capsicum total most halfassed pasta i have had in years super disappointed,1,
this is one of the best cafes around in the area with a wide variety of options on the menu singaporean chilli prawn and keema pav here are the always opt of in doubt the ambience is also pretty cool and the service is impressive a must visit place for hanging out,5,
"overall a 45 experience

this place has an nice warm ambience as their tower burger is not available we have ordered chicken burger along with lamb pizza and lasagne the burger was amazing the patty was so juicy and was perfect the pizza was also good the lasagne was a tad bit disappointing as it was felt grainy in the mouth but tasted delicious the service was very prompt would love to visit this place again",4,
"more is not always merrier hot dog with lettuce and tomatoes was tasting more like a sub sandwich although after removing the veggies it tasted really nice

home style potato wedges were a good attempt but a little too bland

penne pasta was overcooked but the sauce had not soaked in all flavours hence tasted a undercooked

best part was the desert old fashioned pastry which was not too sweet and not too chocolate

overall experience was goodsince the staff is very considerate and ambience is very comforting",3,
"deli 9 bistro is in front of holiday inn express and suites hence becomes a perfect fit to order some dinner

i have ordered one veggie 9 burger and tried shawarma wrap and deli 9 bistro garden veg pizza in the restaurant it self

veggie 9 burger  355
deli 9 bistro garden pizza 455
shawarma wrap  35

pizza was very good it was a thin crust pizza with cheesesauces and veggies on top of it
burger had a patty with cheese and some vegetables like cucumbertomatoes and onionsi found the burger pretty average

with both burger and wrapthey give some wedges and salad complementarywhen i ordered then as well as when i went to their restaurantthe wedges were cold and dry and they were disgustingi can understand if it was only in the case when i ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedgesthat was seriously not expected from deli 9 bistro",3,
"deli 9 bistro is one of the good find in this area for us
we have been looking for a place like this near our office from quite a long and usually had to compromise with some ok places for lunch but if you are also working around this place then deli 9 bistro is a place which will serve you variety of food options with satisfied palate

the ambiance of this place is pretty nice a place to have a conversation with your meal

the staff is polite and friendly and very professional
their menu has food almost everything mood of yours the portion size is decent and taste is also pretty good

kashmiri kebab platter and thai curry rice is good to have
looking forward to try more dishes and update the review",4,
disappointed really disappointed after eating at the original banjara hills outlet this is a sheer letdown loved the banjara hills outlet,3,
allmost all items we ordered were tasteless plus service was average with guy taking orders appeared rude he was behaving like he is owner and does not care if we come back again or not,1,
great ambience great food ordered thai curry with rice paneer butter masala with paratha and veg manchurian bowl easily accessible place with a friendly staff definitely a must try,5,
"visited this place after office and i was not very impressed by the offering of food although the food served was differently presented than usual i did not like it much
did not find it a place to repeat although my friends did like it and i would recommend a visit just to chill with a group of friends",3,
the best part about this place was the ambiance music was cool with very friendly staff was there with a friend and ordered a lamb burger which was small in size and not worth the amount but at the same time it was really tasty,4,
it is all about food a small and a ambience filled with memories and good times deli9bistro has been revamping it is menu across most of their outlets from burgers to rice bowls and noodle bowls too they have got it all but once in a while we like to sit back over the amazing orange frioska that they whip up and the mangalore fried chicken deli9 bistro has some amazing cakes burgers and a whole lot of varities to choose from the menu a must visit place although there is a confusion of choice i clearly declare this as a winner for me 45 is my liking,4,
really love the food itiqliand english food are awesome i would really suggest people who are taking a break from traditional courses to reallt try out this place,4,
one of my favorite restaurants in the locality great food good interiors and good service i love their set of menu the quality portion size and the taste of food never disappoints some of my favorites are stuffed chicken breast curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli and hyderabad hot pizza,5,
"frio like unique name like unique place frio is one awesome place whats really nice is now a days you see these black interiors that is really catching the trend and not they have done it real good

food is amazing they have baked pizzas that is really tasty and cool their cooler drinks are tasty snackers lip smacking

we were 6 of us and this person there sachin was really nice and on spot served us right made sure our food experience was smooth kept asking us feedback of the food it is a lovely place must go

thankyou frio ",5,
"food 

the food was goodeach and every item was deliciousthey are just awesomeits the best place for a quick lunch

the shakes are good and they serve as the perfect drink for the mesmerizing food

ambience 

it is a small place but its beautifully maintained should visit this place during the evening to enjoy the ambience of this place

service and the staff 

the service here is very fast you dont have to wait for anything the staff are very well mannered and are very quick in responding to your order they are well trained to handle the guests and make them feel comfortable

quantity to price 

thank you",4,
multiple bad experiences now food was bad waiter was impolitewhile leaving  my car today got stuck in parking frio manager was outside and pretended to not hear me honking,1,
"best food i have ever hadsatisfied with every dish and there are so yummy we tried club chilly cheese toastmezze platterflorenten gardenspicy tomato arabiattasignature mushroom risoto and
frio is signature tiramasuevery thing is great and uniqueit is not the place for spicy loversu should visit this place to taste unique and delicious foodlove the ambience too",5,
"ambience 4
food 45
service 3
value for money 45

came here for a quick lunch
ordered mezze platter wild mushroom fricassee and peach iced tea
hummus tasted good but the pita bread was a little hard
the pasta was heavenly perfectly cooked pasta and lots of mushroom with an amazing sauce
iced tea tasted nice but was a little too sweet make sure you mention it to them if you are not a fan of super sweet drinks

could improve on the service bit the staff is a little slow and less responsive even when it is not crowded

55 in terms of value if you are a gold member


surely trying this place again",4,
"wonderful restaurant absolutely fabulous food

ambience very nice and comfy does not feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place

food every morsel is heavenly they nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself loved the pizzas the fish and chips is a must order the penne alfredo is pretty good too as is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish absolutely delicious mushroom soup was very nice too minestrone was average could not try the desserts because there is only so much a person can have lol

ps  they do have a bar but no bira

service  polite but you must be patient food preparation takes time if you reach post 930pm you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself

vfm  it is an expensive bistro but the chef deserves it he is absolutely spot on with the flavours i would strongly recommend this restaurant you deserve it",5,
this is my favorite comfort food place almost all the items in their menu are super tasty their keema puff is one of best i have tasted pizza and pasta are delicious too,5,
"good location and menu
at first it seemed like an ordinary place but had a good feel to it
according to food the prices are quite high not like the ingredients are imported
food was decent and so were the drinks
over an average experience",3,
"really really nice addition to the gachibowli food scene this place is comfortably furnished and rather perfect for a long catch up over delectable food

pineapple espresso burgers and the pork ribs are highly recommended pizzas looked interesting as well

good value for money good service although our server seemed slightly clueless initially

definitely worth a couple of visits ",4,
food is okaybut the behaviour of staff is unwelcoming really need to learn how to speak to your guestswhen guests ask anything you need to answer patiently,3,
"this is one of the poor italian restaurants in hyderabad the first giveaway was the menu cards they were all torn and faded few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places
the chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained

coming to the food i can say that it was very disappointing we had ordered 
chicken wings
tangy arrabita pasta
farmer is ortalano
tiramisu

the chicken wings were marketed as a spicy dish but the spice was no where to be felt also the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same  sweet and heavy
the red sauce of the pasta was diluted it was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta
the pizza was the first relief though it was not as it as some of the other restaurants it was thin and it retained its shape
the tiramisu was a disaster the cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour we had to send it back

finally the service the service was one of the very few worthwhile experience

all in all i will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone",2,
i had first been here on my bday last year this place serves some kickass fried chicken starters the service is prompt and lovely adding the zomato gold on top of it just makes the experience even better deriving recommend it,5,
"i liked the interiors of the place they are milimistic and simple with a decent ambience would rate 35
coming to food i had ordered bruschetta and pasta and it was not the best but just ok the cheese balls were good though 35
would rate the staff  255",3,
food was great we ordered andhra chicken pizza which had a variant touch of andhra flavours prawn n fish risotto and fiery chicken meal all the three dishes were tasty and filling we availed zomato gold offer but as we did not inform them before placing the order initially they were very reluctant to accept as we need to inform them well in advance before placing the order the restaurant manager was very understanding and generated a second bill though he will be questioned by the owner he took that extra mile just for providinding customer satisfaction i will definitely suggest this restaurant not only in terms of food but also in terms of their polite and customer oriented generosity thank you frio for making our visit splendid,4,
"i absolutely love their thin crust pizzas and would definitely go there again and again the desserts were just good enough and it made the experience complete
service can do with a minor improvement",5,
i wish i could make you taste the chicken nuggets no offense for the people who liked it but i never had such worst food in my entire life the dip they gave with french fries was one of a kindi personally would not suggest this place to anyone,1,
was there for the desserts i ordered a tiramisuit is one of the best i have eaten loved it only downside place closes down relatively early for a dessert joint,5,
food and ambience was great but the service was a little bit on the lower side as the person was a bit rude with us overall we loved this place  and it made my bday awesome,4,
"a really nice place with some great food

location and ambiece 45
its placed right near the hitex city and gachibowli signal junction and very easy to access
the ambiece is good and decent to visit with your family and friends

food 455
the place has great food and everything is very fresh the hand made pizzas are great and very thin the fish for the fish fingers is fresh and not frozen the desserts are great as well

service 45
the staff is very good and explain the menu well food is served fast as well",4,
"after hearing so much about pork ribs ordered blazed pork ribs and belly dance pizza on my visit 
the ambience was good  but disappointed with the service there was long delay for serving the food no proper attention to the customer requirements was the key disappointment factor

coming to main topic the food pizza was great but it was a mixed feel for pork ribs as i always like my meat to be spicy but the barbequed sauce was little sweet not to my liking

so with my limited knowledge of consistency of meat the overall all food served was good

but it is not a place for people like me who is more into spiciness

with zomato gold the overall bill was 860",4,
"food 45
service 45
ambiance 55
visited this place for dinner yesterday night i would say first visit was very nice pretty empty when we reached but later the restaurant got occupied  we ordered mezze platter and frio signature chicken wings for starters mezze platter was very flavourful and good in quantity chicken wings were also very delicious  the barbecue one was my favourite for the mains we ordered barbecue pork ribs and greek chicken souvlaki both the dishes were absolutely delicious really liked the flavour of the chicken souvlaki
staff is courteous and friendly good experience all together",5,
"very good quality food  i tasted the baby back ribs here and they were delicious one of my other friends had ordered pizza  though the presentation was above standard the taste was not
the ambience of the place can be improved because it is just slightly dull and cramped up at the moment though they can do a lot with the place foodwise a must visit",4,
my pizza looks like they have pieced together the left overs the cheese is hard and the slices look old i am so disappointed as i order quite frequently from frio and this is the second time i am getting a pizza in this condition from them,1,
"frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet interesting evening conversation
the music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud it moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space
service was fine we had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us but were courteous and friendly
here is what we ordered
100 arabica cold coffee  basic and just right creamy and not too sugary
dark chocolate shake  absolute yum and sinful it tastes exactly as you would want it to the only ask  since it is categorized as thickshake it should be thicker but i guess that is the case with shakes served anywhere in the city
chicken ala plancha  sheer dissapointment especially given that it was in chef is special menu it was as ordinary as ordinary can be we ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs it is basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning wouldnt recommend
lamb ravioli  it is a shame we do not get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta even if they do it is mostly vegetarian spinach and ricotta cheese without exception to our delight frio does not disappoint here the ravioli is good does not make it to my top 5 list but still good ravioli was cooked well herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy
we could not get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order 20 mins before closing but i have heard that their tiramisu is great
all in all frio is a good place to visit in terms of food you could love or let is say not love the place basis what dish you ordered i will not be a frequent here but wouldnt mind going back for another try either happy dining",3,
expensive but good food especially italian and finger food decent service though could have been better good location and seating with decent view,4,
"i am reviewing a delivery order

i have ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place
it was soaking in oil and very less quantity

the packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care no spoonfork and tissues were given with the pack

i really liked the way they did not backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes keeping the oil aside the taste was good however there is scope for improvement because i have read good things about this place and their food did not expect it to be like this",3,
"frio is one of my favourite places to go to in gachibowli since it opened and by now i have pretty much tried most of their dishes their staff is cordial and efficient the black toned decor is very avantgarde the quality of their food hasnt deteriorated in the last 2 years
the must try dishes on the menu are 
1 glazed pork ribs sinful and heavenly
2 chermoula grilled fish
3 house chicken salad
4 turkish lamb pizza
5 mushrooms fricasse pasta",5,
the food is the best i have had in hyderabad by far the music does not match the general ambience for me but the concept of the restaurant is quite good service is great the mocktail i had was average at best mushroom khari and the paella are must trys,4,
"i was at this bistro for dinner with my friends recently on a weekday
ambience was decent it was a tad too dark for my liking but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting
service was pretty decent the waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving
the food was a big disappointment though of all the dishes we ordered few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace main course spinach ravioli belly dance pizza stuffed chicken breast and greek chicken sovlakhi was a total disaster not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch we finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake which was good and filling

overall an average restaurant if you are looking for good italian this is not the place to be cibo house is",3,
the coffee at this place was one of the i ever had  a small cozy place with good food is something everyone needs to tackle a hectic week or take a break from the everyday stress the broccoli with cheese and aglio olio are a must have  if you are a coffee lover it is a must try,4,
had an excellent evening at frio well done coffee with stuffed chicken breast the place is very cozy and always full of nice friendly people,5,
food is too delicious ambience is quite good and coming to the food service  staff  manoj  everyone was good mushroom starter was yummy,5,
"this place is my go to place for continental food at gachibowli the food is absolutely awesome my recommendations would be doner kebab any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs

the doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus

in pizza i love the pigs over a blanket pizza the pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here

in mains the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside

in desserts i loved all their creations from the baklava to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu

the service is quick and the staff is courteous",5,
"went on a weekend afternoon with some friends and the place was completely empty
the service was good but the food was not the pasta was completely bland and the pizza too stretchy when we told them to add some spices they just reheated the same and brought it back
the ambience was okay but not worth going just for that
not a good experience at all",2,
i really enjoyed lunch at this place our server mr sachin was really nice  he helped us order and his recommendations were just on topthe pizza is the best a must have here try the ravioli too if you like pasta the place has a laidback friendly vibe,5,
always loved this place for quick food but tasty one staff is very friendly and with smile on face specially manoj must try is mushroom on khari,4,
"455 just wow ambience is pretty cool  loved the food we ordered frio signature chicken wings and bruschetta for starters pork ribs and pan seared fish for main course and of course tiramisu for dessert have not expected to have an yummy  delicious tiramisu your palate thanks you for having such a delicious food definitely would recommend however i felt bruschetta taste was overpowered by olives which are not supposed to be in ",4,
"visited the restaurant for a brunch with team

the service is not as expected i would give a 2 star for it

coming to the food  the taste is good

fish was ok and chicken was ok pizza is tasty",5,
"food quality 35
ambience 35
service 45
whenever a menu of a restaurant is limited we generally expect the taste to be phenomenon most of the things that we ordered were okay but the pasta had very thin sauce and also the pasta was not properly cooked",3,
being rated well on zomato i had expected it to be impressive but the ambiance was just mediocre food was again average did not find anything special about it also there are not really much options on the menu,3,
"overall experience  255

service  35

food quality  i am not able to decide

 taste  it was horrible for me

value for money  35

i dont know why but i really did not liked this place much usually i avoid bad ratings but for the first time i really left my fav chicken wings on table they were too bad in taste will attach the images soon y",2,
we ordered food for home delivery with one line instruction  garlic bread to be prepared without spices which was not fulfilled this was ok what was not was delivery of chicken we ordered vegetarian cheese balls and we received chicken can we ever trust you again frio bistro,1,
"they serve very small portions not at all worth the price service is good tried pizza pasta fiery chicken signature dish none of that was above average taste and prices could have been better zomato gold can be redeemed here

giving extra star just for the service staff they were helpful and prompt",3,
"i had very high expectations from this one but disappointed talking about food  the taste was below average we ordered pasta and pizzas both were not at all good the only thing which i liked about this place is the ambience it is very decent coming to service the waiters were very humble but our order took more than 1 hour to reach us to the table overall below average experience  ",2,
5 stars for the ambiencethe place is super cosy and makes you feel at ease i did not feel like leaving i am a vegetarian so the veg food was pretty good the garlic bread was otherworldly  overall the place is a little pricey but still worth it,4,
it was a funny experience there while the main course is quite satisfying the deserts were a total let down the ground floor could definitely do with some ventilation the fumes from the washroom will drive everyone away,3,
"awesome place  food is great and so is the service 
nice view  worth going and spending time surprises under gold privileges  but nevertheless an pleasant place to spend time with friends  family ",5,
it was a late sunday evening and we decided to go to frio after pulling each others hair for an hour had to call in as the restaurant was about to close in 10 minutes they were gracious enough to take our order and also served us well the food was good it was almost there both the pasta and the risotto we had the curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli chicken was a used scarcely maybe that was a put down for me because i am a meat lover the pasta though was perfect spicy just like i want and the penne was well cooked thanks for taking us in frio on a cold sunday night we will be back,4,
"well if atall i am in gachibowli area in lunch times or dinner timesmy mind like a magnet asks me to get into this cozy bistro each thin slices of pizza wid toppings of olive oil and chilli flakes is all you need for your mid day motivation
have been to this place couple of times and everytime tried something new in veg but pizza has been a constant one the spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds these two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well
a friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place
review2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5
i have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it is the best pizza in town or money back 
tough i did claim the money back as i feel the best pizza in town is what you get here
zomato gold is always an add on benifit 
every time i go to this placei come out happy tummy n happy soul ",5,
good place to visit and the ambiance was awesome best place to hangout with friends food was yummy the starters were good the overall experience was awesome,4,
"1 star less for the bad look the server gave when we mentioned about gold rest are for amazing food 

tiramisu and chocolate dessert best in the area",4,
been to this place last month quite a peaceful place not many people were there we ordered some drinks and pizza and pasta i somehow felt pizza could have been little better the taste was good and it was cooked properly but there were literally no toppings except chicken pasta was clearly not upto the mark i had given specific instructions which werent taken care at all also later during the billing there were some confusions on the gold membership we did inform the staff at tge beginning that we have zomato gold however not sure if that was well communicated to the management because during the billing we were said that we should have informed about the gold membership earlier which we clearly did but did not quite understood whats the problem if it is not communicated at the beginning do they charge differently for the gold membership people because they have offers,3,
food was okay overall but the mocktail was not much tried chef is special fish but was not upto mark by a single iota the ambience was definitely a big plus though with a nice view of the cityscape the service experience was also pleasant,4,
"this place was on my list for a long time
decided to check it out and was badly disappointed

the mild mushroom soup was too bland and they do not serve a 12 of the soup you will have to order 2 soups instead

the red rooster pizza just did not have any taste to it
gachibowli fried chicken was a disaster

stuffed grilled chicken breast was the only face saver at this place

the regular water they served had dust floating on it had to get bottled water

would never go to this place again will not recommend to anyone either

the prices are on the higher side and they are just not worth it",1,
very unprofessional staffs do not even know how to serve the food on request whatever you will ask their 1st answer is no they also do have communication issues very disappointing,1,
"we went to frio bistro on a lazy sunday evening it is easy to find and a cozy place right on the main road the portions are all made for one person only but are very filling we had the alfredo pasta and it was hands down one of the best pastas i have had in the city the starters are good and filling the mocktails are fun tasty drinks
what we had tomato and olive bruschetta highly recommended chilli cheese rolls spinach and corn cheese ravioli artichoke and baby corn a la plancha cranberry kiss highly recommended and mojito
ambience 45
food 455
cost efficiency 45 could have been higher but zomato gold is a saviour",4,
"good food nice ambience and quick service we ordered veg pasta which was very good pizza above average taste and cheese rolls  super cheesy and crispy we like the food the cold coffee was also quite good there ",4,
"the place had an amazing smell of bathroom pee when we entered hillariously the manager seemed barely aware of this horrible stench and promised to spray

the lamb pizza which i suspect used the same sauce as the kheema was good but too salty likely cus it is meant to be eaten with spaghetti the mezze platter is enough for one person barely it is literally a single plate filled with 3 dips and 6 breads the size of a palm without fingers

the desserts is where this place shines they apparently think tiramisu is a soggy cake that fondant cake should taste still of maida because they did not understand the concept and that managers should barely give a shit or apologize

do not go its bad",2,
"this is a great place to have good food with an okaish ambience me and my friends went there for lunch i ordered stuffed chicken breast from the chef is special coloum the dish was great and also looked very nutritious i would recommend this place give it a try you may like it ",4,
we have been to this restaurant twice in last month the and taste of food is really nice and i like it a lot i like mushrooms khari the most and overall service was nice and good experience,5,
really good food friendly staff the pork ribs are a must try the food was well cooked very well presented and the menu had a lot of interesting dishes,5,
somedays it is decent but somedays it is so not good yesterday we ordered fish paella and the rice was tasteless just dipped in chilli water i love spicy food but not like this we also ordered lamb bolognese and for both dishes it looks like they recycled the same generic masala mixture it was so pungent,2,
the place is not too huge or classy but it is good enough to have a nice peaceful meal went for dinner and ordered a pizza and arabiata pastaboth veg pizza was thin crust and it was one of the best crust i had in a while if you like the original taste of tomato then this pasta is for you as it retained that taste,5,
interesting menu backed up by execution a variety of continental cuisines tried one of the first places i have seen try a spanish paella in hyderabad good value too,4,
i was here with my pals for a lunch we have tried a pizza and ravioli here which was so good the whole review will be updated soon the place has a good ambience,4,
"i would rate it 34 star it is a mediocre restaurant with different cuisine
food was ok first was minestrone soup it did not have any exotic vegetables or pasta tangy taste was good mezze platter was averagehumus was good while pita bread was not upto the mark thin crust pizza farmers orelanto was good had nice crust among deserts ordered for chocolate fondant it was the best with right amount of sweetness
presentation of each and every dish was superb staff is polite good place for quiet dinner can improve on food taste though",3,
awsome as always keep it up,5,
"veg guy review good restaurant soup taste was nice pizza crust was with good thin and crispy and very good olive spinich flavour rosetto test is good
moctain taste ok can improve on their choice options and taste
service staff good attention
interior of restaurant fine
zomato gold applied so got good discount
veg start can have more choices",5,
good food but not very friendly customer service the servers were way unfriendly overall average experience would request management to improve the quality of staff serving the food their attitude needs to improve,2,
"the place has a nice quiet ambience i was surprised that it was not crowded as you would expect a top place to be on a weekend

we were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place the place had a nice charm to it  we ordered the tangy grilled mushrooms and the glazed pork ribs but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order we came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly when i checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 1015pm

coming to food the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that is probably my palate  the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too

the waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you do not actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food it just does not leave a good experience possibly the restaurant and it is employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way

the rating is for the food and the place in generalservice is a bare minimum",3,
average food i had cheese garlic bread pizza and white sauce pasta cheese garlic bread was good but pizza had lof oil in it and pasta had no sauce it was a bit dry did not like it much staff and ambiance were good,3,
"frio bistro is located in gacchibowli below the tilt i went here with a couple of friends i had ordered belly dance pizza and ravioli the pizza was damn good nice crisp crust and the toppings were perfect but coming to the ravioli i was very disappointed it had way too much pepper in it and the taste of the sauce was not satisfactory either

service 45
ambience 45
pizza 55
ravioli 35
overall 355",3,
a sophisticated and calm place to eat i am a big fan of their stuffed cheese steak chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach served with mashed potatoes and veggies the sangria was not up to the mark and the chocolate shake was also average i would definitely go there for their pastas and the stuffed steak,3,
we ordered spinach and cheese cream ravioli and spicy tomoto pastas spinach and cheese cream ravioli was delicious but i expected it to be white sause pasta and it was red sauce pasta pit master oizza was good cheese lovers was not so good it was thin crust and taste was awfuloverall it was overpriced and taste was not very great but ok ok,3,
i really had high expectations for frio bistro it would been on my toeat list for a while the food is average we had a pasta the chicken  sausage paella and a cheesecake nothing was really sooo yummyout of the world and it was really costly but the staff was courteous however i probably will not come here again,3,
great pizza decent rissoto but no wifi as mentioned had difficulty using gold as there is no network would recommend this place to a friend,4,
"hummus hummus hummus 
went crazy for the hummus  already been there twice 
nice variety of international cuisine and deserts 
looked the decor  should go there in the evening 


must try is  mezze platter 
prawn and fish paella
chicken chilli nuggets",4,
just be careful ordering here they mix up vegetarian and non vegetarian food it is a good chance that you get served a non vegetarian dish instead of veg version of the same staff is a bit clueless lazy service overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes nothing great or distinctive this review is strictly based on lunch experience  not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time,1,
"the food and drinks are amazing herethe beer cocktail is very good
the service is also very goodthe ambience is vertical soothing
they also serve coffee which is awesome",5,
the ambience is excellent  the food not so much  we ordered a half n half pizza  margarita  bbq chicken  the pizza was not up to the mark  now for the second dish we had ordered was alfredo chicken pasta  the pasta sauce was very liquidish  chicken was undercooked i am have visited this restaurant before  it was an awesome experience  we used zomato good during this visit of ours  not sure if this has anything to do with the food taste  there were 2 pizza slices left  the the restaurant said they will not pack the leftover food as they said it was orders  rules from zomato  they said they would rather throw the left over in the dustbin but not give it to the customer  this is very strange rules  zomato relook at your guidelines,2,
"frio bistro is a finedining restaurant with classy interiors which was painted full of black color which brings the elagance to the place the bar setup was smallquirky  the inverted glasses tied up with the ceiling made it look beautiful this place offers italianindian  continental as well

i visited this place yesterday for a quick lunch  ordered two main course dishes the first dish was belly dance pizza which is a 12 thin crust pizza topped with arabian shawarma peicescapsicum which had that earthy flavor in it  the chicken pieces were juicy  tender the whole pizza tasted delicious with it is toppings the other dish we ordered was spinach  cream cheese ravioli pasta was hand made by the chef added with italian styled tomato salsa  fresh parmesan cheese  ravioli was stuffed with spinach which was not up to the mark after having pasta i felt like i should have ordered the white sauce variant

andservice was a bit late if you are in a hurry the service might create a problem for you",4,
if you are looking for an authentic italian pizza this is the place to be loved the food esp the pizzas and the pasta service is good while ambiance is totally worth a visit,4,
great service especially the barman he took care of the kids and their needs small gestures go a long way i would strongly recommend this restaurant thank you frio,4,
a nice place for a date went there on a sunday afternoon service was fast we had 1 ceasar salad  which was good 2 spinach and cream cheese ravioli  which was okay,5,
"was here with my colleagues the service was excellent vegetarian food was good my colleagues liked the nonveg dishes a lot ambience is decent
would visit them again to try more options in veg",4,
"so we decided to have some grub on a monday afternoon and dashed off to frio bistro for no particular reason there were not many customers around and that definitely helped us get some attention but the service was ok we carefully curated our order  chimichuri pan fried fish lamb ravioli and andhra pepper chicken pizza i must say the food tasted authentic and delicious

chimichuri pan fried fish the chef is special came with fish boasting a tangy and spicy herb crust salsa sauteed spinach and scallion rice it was easily the best dish we ordered the lamb ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein then came the spicy andhra pepper chicken pizza it generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then

all in all the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit


made another visit and uploading some pictures
",4,
"have been for lunch honestly speaking had a good expectations but not really did the food satisfy my taste buds

soup rustic itallian minestrone was a good start to begin with assuming something different it will be ordered gacchibowli fried chicken only to realise it was another version of kfc friend chicken this was little disappointing and in main course stuffed chicken breast was descent and not so out of the world taste but it is ok

all in all descent ambience ok food but service has to be improved a lot for me for sure not a second time visit place rest you can do try for sure you may be lucky and fortunate to get better taste of food",3,
awesome food keep rocking guys had lunch yesterday and their cheese cake both were awesomei will visiting this place more frequentlywill suggest to my friends also,5,
it is a good place food was good they can increase quantity little bit service was fast enough ambience is good overall we liked the place,4,
after looking at all these good rdviews i thought the food would be greatbut it was notdominos pasta is far better than thisi orderd salsa pasta cost 415 rsnot upto the markthen ordered few more veg items nd they were not good it does not justify the prices at alli ate better pastas at my office restaurents at half the pricenot happy with food quality though ambience nd service was goodmay b in veg they dont hve better quality food,2,
"frio bistro is a little quaint place tucked away somewhere in the crowded area of gachibowli
the decor was very pretty and the place looked very cosy
we had nonveg pizza and chicken wings for starters both were equally good the highlight of our meal was pork ribs which was served with veggies and mashed potato the pork was soft and succulent and melted instantly in our mouth one could easily say that was prime moment of our dine at frio bistro
desserts were good as well but could have been better
overall it is a nice place to visit if you want to have a comfortable meal in the midst of the hustle bustle of this city
would definitely go back to this joint for their amazing pork ribs",4,
food was good service was great the staff is super courteous but the food did not really make me go wow this is amazing it was good but then again not out of this world it is a great place to hang out we had the bacon pizza alfredo pasta and the prawn and fish paella on a visit before that we had the mushroom risotto the mushroom risotto was great the bacon pizza can have a bit more of the pizza sauce on it i did not like the taste of the raw red pepper in the paella finished with hot chocolate which was amazing looking forward to trying a few other dishes there on the next visit,3,
really good tastetried twice both the time had a good experience good ambience vallet available courteous staff can be a go to place on repeat without doubt,4,
"i wish i could give it a 35 but do not have the option just for the record it deserves a strong 3 closer to a 4

we tried the pizza chicken breast stuffed with spinach spaghetti followed by deserts

the turkish pizza was the stand out dish for us we did not expect that the others were also very good and i would go again for sure

the tiramisu although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down the bakhlava was just okay not a bad attempt the cheese cake on the other hand was yumm

overall i would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side we ended up paying about a 1200 per head ",3,
"had a family lunch while on a visit to hyderabad suggested by my son settled for the meal

we went with the suggestion of the steward for starters had mushroom on khari turned out to be a good choice
son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket he was okay

spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering when we informed the steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising turned out to be too saucy no traces of parmesan cheese probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne

finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu a bigger disappointment",3,
very awesome place for people who loves the continentals with european  i totally very very impressive of frio is team hospitality  my favorite here is english chese balls and chese cake,5,
"unhappy mezze platter had no taste and they took over 45 mins to prepare the food in spite of showing an expected delivery time of 30 mins not satisfied with service or taste thumbs down for me ",2,
"one of fav place to eat the italian foodwhenever feel like having good italian food i come over this place and try different dishes  i love their garlic breads  pasta  thin crust pizza  some rice items etc etc if you love italian food and cheesy food this is the must try place here
recommendation  do try the blueberry cheese cake got it eggless here  its really awesome
if prefer zomato gold here if you have that u can njoy more as u get dishes for free

ambiance  40
food  40
service  40

"this place has a really aesthetic ambiance starting from the vintage design to the 6070s music that plays in the background
we ordered the famous irani chai with a bunch of onion samosa fries and a pasta sandwich

this place serves one of the best irani chai that i have had in hyderabad the onion samosa takes me back to my childhood days when we used to buy them at small shops for a rupee or so they tasted amazing here i wouldnt recommend getting the chai ir samosa delivered at all kills the taste completely these needs to be had hot and getting it delivered will definitely disappoint

talking about the fries i wouldnt say they were amazing but they sure werent bad we did not like the pasta sandwich this item wouldnt be something that i would recommend

this place would remain one of my favorite spots to hangout at

could be a little cleaner though",4,
"one of the worst services i would have ever come across there were two incidents at the same cafe and the feedback given to them was not even reviewed
the first time i ordered an irani chai and it took them 1hour to serve and it was one first chais ever consumed it was served in a broken glass very disappointed

the second time my female friend wanted to use the washroom but it was extremely dirty and smelling


it is sad to see such disappointment from a brand like karachi",2,
"want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you are at it  munch on some delicious food karachi cafe  gachibowli is the place for you
food
peri peri chicken this dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce is served with mashed potatoes garlic bread and sauted vegetables
the chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact it was already sliced to bite sized pieces
chicken pesto sandwich the sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup it has very light taste and perfect meal for two on hot summer day
bun maska literally the best buns you could get your hands on filled with fresh cream melted butter and a layer of white sugar it is literally addictive

beverages
cold coffee the beverage was not cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place would not recommend this drink
irani chai generally irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this was not very sugary it had a mild yet tempting taste  would definitely recommend

ambience every wall is decorated with vintage posters articles and artwork the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family",4,
"staffs are very polite friendly and understand customer is problem like i was unable to eat continental in the plate that they have served but they noticed and served extra plate before i ask them for
ambiance of cafe is very nice full of old stuff photographs and plants as well
u can also put the plant on your table
food is good and quantity is more than enough

the food was okay the ambience was good but the waiter is behavior was not good a zomato guy came to receive an order he asked for a glass of water and they denied him and told him to wait outside,2,
"been to this place a few months back i must say it has a very aesthetically pleasing decor both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement is available it is also pretty easy to locate

the items we ordered were barbeque mushroom sandwich spaghetti in alfredo sauce with vegetables apple pie with vanilla ice cream irani chai and filter kapi apart from the apple pie all the items were really tasty the pie is crust was a bit too thick rest everything was worth every single penny i would love to visit this place again

quantity 455

value for money 455

i also happened to order their exotic vegetable pizza through zomato i found the price quite reasonable the best part was the sauce with a desi twist

karachi caf with a variety of food and beverage items and an amazing ambience is a really cool place to hangout",4,
very bad service i had to askfor a glass of water 5 times one waiter passes the message to another and the other one does not care horrible service i m never going back there,1,
this place has a eye catching ambience a small cafe that is best for a quick meeting short break etc i tried the pasta that was a bit spicy but good in taste,4,
it is a very mind soothing place you may find out childhood stuffs a aroma of 80 is are all around a great place to hang out for friends and couples food prices are not beyond limit,4,
looking for a cute place for a date and chai then it is among my top 5 loved their pasta and the jam roll was wow can not wait to go there again,5,
man who the hell are giving such high ratings to such useless cafes yesterday i went to one cafe seeing a 4 zomato rating and it was horrible today i went here and it even exceeded that other cafe today in terms of pure patheticness of the cafe the service is so rude slow and pathetic that you wonder how bad would it be to make it self service the food is bad and certainly not worth such high prices and the guys are least bothered to tell you by the time that you ask for bill that one of the drinks you ordered is not available let alone bring drinks along with the food i do not know how these inflated ratings in hyderabad is working but in my hometown a place like this would hardly touch 2 stars rating on zomato,1,
"i really wish i could finish off the review in a word but yeah zomato is not letting me to that if you guys want to have irani chai i guess this is the place and omg that onion samosa before getting there do you guys remember the small triangle shaped samosa we would all go gaga for yes they have it you do not need to go street to street searching for them they have it right here so one plate samosa irani chai and osmania biscuits you hit cloud nine oh i forgot this is for you guys to the guys who are living alone far away from your own home without your mamma and pappa you would definitely wanna hit this place listening to mere sapno ke rani kab yea only kishore kumar  and the place let is just say it is all vintage

ambience455
service 45
this place has amazing interior and a cafe without good interior is not worth to go to it has rustic feel
the food is really good amazing north indian mughlai food they serve here service was okayish",4,
"this restaurant deserves a special mention for their superbly amazing keema pav i usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants i prefer homemade but the keema pav served here reminded me of home  it is that good we had even ordered for baida roti  which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it by the way their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for suleimaani chaai also deserves a special mention it was so good that we ordered it twice
the ambience is also so good they had these old ad posters put up on their walls  it really reminded me of those old parsi restaurants in mumbai",5,
love the ambience has a rustic feel to it i recommend the chai and their baked goods the service is good and everything is reasonably priced,5,
"the ambience literally brings you the vintage feels the service of this place is brilliant
when i visited this place firstly i had ordered for some bun maska and sulaimani chai really liked it i also had the chicken kabiraji personally i felt it could have been slightly better",4,
this place serves some authentic mughlai dishes with a modern twist to it do try the mughlai paratha here which is stuffed with chicken with a sip of irani chai,4,
this place brings you vintage feels the ambiance is adorable with all the wall frames and vintage decor tried alfredo pasta with fried chicken toppings which tasted good service was fine,4,
"vibrant colors and delicious food this place has all you want to lift up your spirits the combination of raw and retro ambience will leave you mesmerized immerse yourself in their zesty food variety because they have a lot to offer

irani chai was made to perfection i got a strong sweet and milky tea in one chai glass

service was great",5,
"dishes tried keema pav baida roti

the food is pretty good i mean i have tasted better keema pav but this also good notbhrrst but good baida roti was pretty interesting taste

the staff was very welcoming ambience is pretty great",5,
went to the place not expecting much the menu threw me off as most of it seemed overpriced we ordered irani chai and mawa cup cake to begin with both of these were really good we followed that up with barbecue mushroom and club chicken sandwich the sandwich was filling and very delicious we topped it off with another round of irani chai the place has an old worldly feel about it with old posters transistor old tv etc yo take you to the good old times also old bollywood songs add to the charm great place to have a cup of tea and snacks,4,
"looking for a nice evening chai and something to go with it  this can be one really good option located in gachibowli just off the main raod it is a nice small cafe

the interiors give you a feeling of a hangout place for the millennials  to just come sit relax  have tea and just engage in hearty conversation if you have a office in financial district one can take out probably an hour and can visit the place

i would definitely recommend some of the items

"had veg puff here a number of times but this karachi cafe never disappointed
everything is fresh and tasty but the only downside is that the sandwiches and burgers are just reheated and served
a few of the menu items are available only from afternoon and get over pretty quickly so i usually call them up to check before i visit this place",4,
"a vintage themed cafe by the legendry karachi bakery with a soothing ambience having some posters advertisement old movie scenes hanging up framed on the wall liked the old time television telephone sound tape which are also an add on to the decor the food variety they offer is something that can be related to quick bites had dum ki chai and it was soo refreshing one could be compared with  kadak chai
a visit may uplift your mood  
overall good experience",4,
"this retro themed cafe was cozy where u can get lost reading ur fav book at the corner table indulging in retro music u can not help but shake a leg
the famous irani chai with thr richness of milk is all u need for a gloomy day
stylish chicken sandwich is a must try with perfectly grilled chicken
do not try the items marked as must try they are actually the ones that does not taste good 
on a sweet note u must try their victoria cake slice  blueberry cheese cake",4,
"i had a really bad experience in karachi cafe i have visited this place with a lot of hope as the rating and the review are really good ordered only ginger tea irani tea osmania biscuits but unfortunately we did not like anything they offered

even the tea was not good and the pricing is really high and i am not ok with paying rs 75 for a bad cup of tea

sorry folks you guys need to improve",2,
"the retro theme ambience was classic
but i didnt like the food over there it was average i even ordered ferrero rocher shake and would rate it 25",2,
cozy place that offers good variety of food we loved the burgers n pastas would love to try the kabiraji in my next visit to hyderabad it is bit overpriced but quality wise it is very decent must try one u r in gachibowli,5,
"this was the first place i visited after reaching hyderabad located off the main road in gachibowli this place serves delectable food the ambience gives a feeling of retro space with the decor mostly consisting of retro themed wall hangings

we tried the keema pav paneer tikka sub and macaroni sandwich the service was on the slower side the food took around 30mins to reach our table keema pav was simply awesome the keema was nicely done it was quite flavorful the macaroni sandwich and till sub was also good but have had better in the past we were also served for fruit biscuits which was again simply delicious

overall a good place to have some snacks and chat",4,
what a variety of biscuits cookies cakes etc it was a delight to find gluten free and sugar free options too we ordered for hazelnut coffee muffin tomato cheese sandwich veg puff etc everything was delicious enjoyed,4,
"i tried their ginger tea some cookies and apple pie and i loved all of them the price is definitely high for tea but so is the quantity the picture is showing one by two of one ginger tea ",4,
"the visit to this place was something on my mind for a long time this was rated highly on zomato and was recommended by a number of my contacts so decided to give it a shot on a friday night with the homeminister 
we came in late but the place was still lively on entering you definitely notice the ambiance which is a bit idyllic and retro with the 70s and the 80s song playing in the background you definitely feel like going back in some time 

we settled in and ordered fries keema pav and chicken farcha to gulp it all down we ordered the irani chai 

boy o boy we were in for a treat all the dishes were simply delicious and mouthwatering their keema pav is true to its name and fame amazing the chicken farcha was crispy on the outside and juicy inside all the dishes were served piping hot which enhanced the taste

service was a bit slow but it could be understood as the meals were served hot though the place is small it can comfortably sit a good amount of people with seating outside as well slightly on the pricier side we still felt it was worth it given the quantity with the trusted name of karachi sweets as the backers you can definitely count on the quality

i was introduced to this brand in airport then came across their biscuits in spencers so when in hyderabad how could i miss visiting karachi bakery this outlet was near my temporary residing place i like their cookies a lot but i have fallen in love with their chocolates the sugar free ones are also yumm,4.5,
i have ordered red velvet cake once they asked to change the order as red velvet was not available so i asked the available list of cake and on that list i ordered chocolate cheesecake after 50 min of waiting they again call me and told that cheesecake is not available what kind of behavior is this never order from here,1,
this place is lost in the row of cafes and restaurants in gachibowli cute little cafe with vintage indian vibes having posters of old hindi movies and early air india adorning their wall can be a good spot for a casual date or a catch up we ordered an irani chai and nankatai both of them were yum,4,
one of the best cafes in hyderabad to spend time in do try irani chai if you are here the staff is really courteous the decor is top notch love the ambience of the place and again do try the irani chai if you are here,5,
i am obsessed with the irani chai at karachi cafe the first time i had irani chai was here and i fell in love with the place my friend and i come here once in a while to catch up and we just love this cafe it is so cute quiet and very pretty i love the theme i am not really sure how the food is we have had their mawa cake which goes great with the chai and the paneer sub which was not that great but nonetheless it is one of my favorite places,4,
another place where i wanted to visit from long this is vintage brings back your childhood days only if you are a 90s or earlier born  excellent place ambience and tasty food their rolls are yummy and keem pav is a must try dish,5,
"back with review as i promised
the kheema pav is amazing and a must try 

nice retro ambiance very well done the interiors has been very carefully done love the paint on walls and the props used
did not get much time to spend but would definitely love to spend more time at this place
the crew is friendly too
will write about food after my next visit ",5,
nice place to go for a casual snacks and smoothies rate is slightly higher but the food quality is okay dinning space is very good one can seat outside watch the road and enjoy the food as well,3,
a really nice place for a date ambience is very good  old songs playing in the background antique looking showpieces hanging all around food is great too tried pasta sandwich and samosa here and they were good,5,
"nice place to hangout with ur frnds over a cup of irani chai and endless gossips
very affordable and usually very busy place
must try bun maska here",3,
"starting off i was amazed by the looks and ambience of the place from the side of the road  so i was anticipating it 

on a sunny sunday morning i convinced my friends to come down here 

the ambience and the themed decorations was fascinating and how they maintained it so well and beautifully
the kettle shaped water jug and the bulb shaped salt containers the rough and old furniture look and the old bollywood movie dialogue and old popular brands  all of it put together was so so appealing to me 
the old big radio and the dial up telephones brought back so many childhood memories 

coming to what we ordered

bbq chicken sub
chicken 65 sub
omlette sandwich
crispy chicken burgers
apple pie with vanilla ice cream

the first thing that as lovely about each of theseexcept apple pie of course that they were whole some and there were generous amount of french fries t and wedges to go along with the mains 

i had the burger and it was damn fulfilling
crispy square chicken patties and layered with veggies and lettuce it was really nice however to be critical it could have done with more cheese or mayonnaise 

the subs were spicy and had substantial chicken pieces and the omlette sandwich was pretty decent too 
overall i felt the pocket pinch was quite normal for a cafe  at least the food satisfied our appetite 

ps  they took their theme very seriously and that shows when you enter the washroom 
you will find a old rexona ad in a frame 

all in all the place seemed perfect for all occasions for a romantic date or getaway
for a group outing for people who love ambience and for random tea meet ups as well 

must visit  ",5,
"yesterday it was a good evening we spent at karachi cafe along with the entire team it is a very decent place for discussion eating or for a date

we ordered various things like samosas chicken kobirazi veg cutlet paneer kathi roll macaroni sandwich veg grilled sandwich etc all the items were very good and pretty tasty the irani chai was fabulous

it is a place with the theme old is gold so you can see pictures from the past hanging on the walls
all of you can try out this place as it is located very near to it offices
service was good cost wise also it is not very high would like to taste some more items from the menu",4,
food is good and also service if someone wants to have a touch of bengali food this is the place also dinner can be completed in some reasonable price,3,
"old is the new new 
a 19th century themed caf which has a soothing ambiance it will remind some of you of your childhood posters advertisements scenes from the past are framed and put up all over the 4 walls the food is is amazing i went for the pink penne grilled chicken pasta and we could not resist finishing it even though we were half full lemon tea barfeilly chai is a refreshing mix
must visit as this place will definitely uplift your mood",5,
had pizza at near by pizza hut and badly wanted to have a dessert so randomly choose this place to have dessert we have ordered victoria cake slice and old fashion chocolate cake and we deeply liked them both interior theme should be mentioned here specially its rustic antique and has a distinctive style to it must try place,4,
ordered barbecue mushroom sandwich and mawa cake the mushroom stuffing in sandwich was sweet tangy and spicy potato wedges were given as a side for sandwich it tasted good and the mawa cake was fine too they were of reasonable price overall it was a good experience,4,
4 for the ambience and the biscuits the taste of the irani chai and mawa cake can be improved by at least 410 levels but the brand name really works,4,
"ordered red sacuce pasta and got white sauce pasta by mistake 

rate
pasta 525

however delivery was quite quick ordered from swiggy and also got a refund same time for delivering wrong order ",3,
"si please place with simple food reminds of those good old days before technology took over best place to come over for a chai and a conversation
fine biscuit irani chai and roohafza are my favourites here",4,
went there with a friend on a weekday evening ordered bbq chicken and nizami roll the chicken in both dishes did not taste good and was not fresh irani chai was not up to the mark cost wise its on the higher side and not worth it overall a bad experience,2,
this branch along with one at madhapur and in forum mall is one of the better and upmarket karanchi joint this is just below the diners pavilion and next to paradise quite a good offering of bakery and light snacks with a sitting area at the back place for light snacks pastries and muffins,4,
one of the first thing that one would notice as soon as you enter in this cafe is the sense of nostalgia with old school themed pictures and walls which makes for a great ambience the food here is also very good specially pasta sandwich and mava cake are must try,4,
"visited this place for an early lunch as every other nearby place dint start serving

ambience looked classic with those vintage vibes

ordered penne in alfredo sauce which took 40 mins for them to serve it tasted average it was loaded with way too much of cheese which i do not expect in pastas i wouldnt mind that if it was a pizza though",2,
absolutely loved the place the food aesthetics everything i was pretty lost looking at the antiques and having veg cutlet with filter coffee thought it was expensive while looking at the menu but the quantity was pretty good much recommended,5,
"the perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon with your loved one this retro cafe will rewind you back to the 70s ambience is the usp of this cozy little cafe old classics playing in the background would soothe you with nostalgia

we settled for an irani chai coupled with mawa cake while the tea was top notch the cake was just about average service is very good

overall one of those places where ambience can pull you again and again",3,
"if u r looking for a place to chill and relax this is the place fruit juices are fresh ordered bombay sandwich which was worth the money ambience is nice and service too overall

a cafe by the legendary karachi bakeryit lives upto the name the ambience literally transports you to old times with posters from old brands and smallest of details taken care of like the television and telephone from the old times that no one uses now are a part of the decor service is also good with prompt and courteous staff food presentation is good and taste wise can not say much as we only tried the irani chai which was really good overall a really good experience,4,
"lovely decor the service is slow but the staff are good love the menu here pocket friendly prices
we tried out the chicken kabiraji bbq chicken sub paneer chicken sub and the nizami khati roll
loved the taste the quantity was perfect too",4,
"it was a payday and was looking for pocket friendly restaurant in indira nagar area when we encountered karachi cafe as you enter the restaurant you time travel to 80s90s era the wall paint bit rugged and the walls decorated with movie posters and advertisements of the bygone era to submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set radio and a landline with round dialling pad milk cans kettle glass jars and of course the attire of the waiters the old melodies make you just go wow

coming to the food we ordered chicken kabiraji and macaroni pink grilled chicken pasta
let is discuss each in an order

chicken kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg

next delicacy macaroni pink grilled chicken pasta remotely similar taste of pasta which i experienced was a long time back the blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless the quantity was great for two

i would suggest to visit this place with good hopes and do try other items on the list

had cutlet was a big let down  can do better with the taste even the accompaniment is a normal store bought ketchup menu could be listed as beet root  cutlet instead of cutlet to prepare the mind,2,
"i like the food i would like to come again
though the service was a little slow and it was a buzzing place the irani chai was awesome
zain",5,
"i visit karachi bakery regularly for biscuits and sweets this cafe is located on the same road as the karachi bakery outlet
the cafe has a brilliant old school charm which will take you back in time posters of old films and redundant brands are all over the walls of this cafe
this place serves the best irani chai period the mawa cake was decent too osmania biscuits as usual tasted brilliant
irani chai osmania biscuits and mawa cake is a brilliant combination
people with an old school taste can definitely try this cafe",4,
the interiors and the ambience are lovely perfect old bollywood music is soothing the food is great the presentation and the service both,5,
"place when you want to hangout for a chai with your loved one on a lazy day  they serve fantastic chai which goes well with karachi is large variety of biscuits ",5,

went there with good expectations coz i have been here many tyms but felt of writing a review today coz food was baad mainly standardsbun maska in initial days it used be best but now i did not find it great but ok kheema pav was today best i can say had bheja n roti as well it was well cooked but missed the actual flavours of the spices i some how liked the hyderabadi style but one can try irani style herei did not like the irani chai one can get a better chai outside small local cafes well maintained ambience overall it was average with taste n flavors may i need to try some more dishes,2,
an amazing cafe by karachi bakers each and every corner was used in a much different way a very retro theme was given with all the vintage pieces placed interior was very colorful and the yummiest part was the food i tried the pasta sandwiches which were just mind blowing a must try place,5,
"this cafe has a retro feel and it carries it very well
the staff is very courteous and patient
their speciality baida roti a stuffed paratha is amazing",5,
"the ambience reminds you of all the 90 is things old movies posters brands etc tried irani chaibun maska dum ki chaistrong tea mushroom sandwich crispy chicken burger and mutton keema pav the food is really nice but you will have to wait a bit longer for the food to be on your table

the ambiance walls furniture is all old fashioned would remind you of the old parsi cafes in goa or bombay they play old bollywood music of 1970s which blends perfectly with the mood the staff is extremely courteous
we were two of us and we ordered so much irani chai bombay khari fruit nankhatai maska bun keema pav ricevegkhuchamber raita combo and a sweet lime juice everything tastes delicious
the portions are limited and the prices are a bit on the higher side but all in all it is totally worth it this is going to be my go to place in the city from now on",5,
the whole package was upside down,4,
nice old school ambiance irani chai n biscuits are very nice fav tried and tasted dishes chicken sandwich bheja fry irani chai paneer burji bombay biscuits and fruit buiscuits very weird but true pasta is amazing feels like not the right place to have pasta but it is good,5,

ps it had a bad effect on my tummy as well",1,
too much of salt n oil not even good quality of bread,1,
awsome,4,
place is good but they are charging too much cost better to go paradise as compared to karachi cafe if you have too much money then you should go to this place,3,
chicken 65 is a chinese dish  i do not understand why do you have to out curry leaves in it,3,
delivery boy said that he met with an accident food got spill out of packed box,1,
we saw their iftar special menu on zomato and went for iftar to our surprise the staff was not even aware of the word iftar so we ordered from their regular menu the service is quick food is really tasty the liveliness of the cafe and the retro music would surely boost your spirits,4,
"would visit this place again just for the calmness and memories it is ambience take you back to the menu is limited does not spoil you with choice and that might be blocker for you to visit the place repeatedly

the service and the taste of the food both were decent and nothing to complain of

if you love savouring snacks from the old city with a cup of tea this is the place to be though there are places which give you a better taste for the same things in the menu they do not offer the ambience of this cafe

visit this place when you are not that hungry and want to unwind with a snack n a cup of tea",4,
ordered pasta and taste was not at all good,1,
delicious,4,
the tea was just half cup for 55 rs half cup tea u r looting people here will never order from here again ginger tea does not taste like ginger its just sugarcane juice and that too when we asked for less sugar,1,
the taste of haleem was good but the quantity is not good for the price compared to others,3,
"big fan of all day breakfast in bed order from this amazing little eatery

from vegetarian heart shaped nutella pancakes to a classic english breakfast with omelettes and hash browns they have got it all

they also have a dinein available if you wish to drop by not to mention the place also whips up some amazing shawarma and rice combos

juices to coffee they have got everything you need all this without burning a hole in your pocket

in picture

i had ordered their nutella pancakes and coffee the packaging was perfect and the nutella was well smothered the coffee had not leaked either
while the pancakes were true to being eggless the baking sodapowder was slightly overpowering but still manages to be one of the best eggless pancakes joint for me",4,
"as of now i have tried 2 rice bowls and 1 shawarma from here 
1 non veg green slimy monster bowl
2 veg the iron monster bowl
3 desi original chicken shawarma

all 3 of them i liked a lot especially 1 and 3

me being a healthy food eating person instructions of using less oil and less chilli were correctly taken into account by the restaurant and the taste also was great

quality and quantity were both quite satisfying great job

one suggestion from my side will be to add calories ingredients and nutritients information for ex protein fat carbs content micro nutrients information for each dish being offered this will be very helpful for everyone especially for people like me who want to eat clean and healthy",4,
i ordered red monster box mini for 95 rupees 4 pieces of fried chicken were there the taste was good there was another box which had chicken makhani with biryani rice the quantity was very less it was not enough for one person and the taste was also not so great,3,
"the place might seem small from outside but you have quite a good space for seating inside the place had offers when we went and we had veg and non veg rolls which were okay okay the waffles here are amazing
must try the waffles here",4,
rice bowls and shawarmas are very goodand tasty i had a chicken sabbha shawarama and iron monster rice bowl it had very tastey nice restaurant amazing rice bowls delicious food,5,
"in love with their pancakes
i have tried classic pancake and chocolate chips pancakes both were done well and recommended
will definitely try other items from the menu",5,
we ordered chicken shawarma with salad and chicken pizza square we received free freebie along with this order we recommend this place i like to order more,5,
i have ordered chicken shawarma with salad and pizza square and i have got free freebie along with this order am very happy with this order i like to order more from this restaurant,5,
"i read about this place in best shawarmas listing in google and ordered peri peri chicken shawarma it is average because i regularly eat shah ghouse one is for sure shah ghouse is a lot better than this and there is no reason to prefer this over that

and for the coke drink they took 60rs for a 20rs bottle seriously",2,
so i make videos on youtube on food and books and the name of my channel is thefoodie bookworm and i just ordered randomly from the place because it was similar to the name of my channel but i must say that i am super satisfied with the chicken peri peri shawarma and the pancakes they are just yumm do try this place out,4,
ordered for brownie which was completely dry and was not fresh at all choco banana waffle was okay not so good they send the food in big box which looks like will have good quantity but will get a small piece and that is too tasteless,1,
just now i have ordered chicken strips and pancake combo we like the food from here and chicken strips was crispy i like to order food from this restaurant,5,
best place to order pan cakes in town i have tried the pan cake with maple syrup and i must confess it was really good the price is also reasonable,3,
earlier my personal favorite was cupid crunchy chicken rice bowl but recently i noticed that the taste has changed the gravy is sour and the chicken pieces are not crispy as they used to be,4,
"no maple syrup with pancakes and waffles
if no maple syrup is to be included in your combo please specify it but serving pancakes and waffles without syrup or anything else is simply not acceptable this is the second time this has happened",1,
"located near dlf iiit  this small place is mostly for swiggy orders interior is simple and cosy we had combo deals booked through dineout we were supposed to have pizza squares but they had run out of it so they offered another shawarma instead shawarma and nuggets were served first after waiting for sometime we got the mint cooler and waffles

food is tasty and delicious however service is bit slow

will recommend for online delivery from comfort of home combo deals are really easy on pocket",4,
"we dropped at this place on sunday morning for breakfast it is a small cafe with quirky posters and phases on the wall which will definitely catch your attention
coming to food we ordered two combos  shawarma  nutella waffle  citrus mint cooler and best of both worlds we also tried spiced bell pepper omelette which was really good other items were average nothing great quantity of the food was good

i ordered french toast but didnt taste like french toastchef team can work on this for a better output there are very few places where french toast is available if the taste is improved this place can lead,3,
i ordered a green chicken rice bowl largeit had less than 10gms of chicken forget about the box size shawarma would have had more quantityi do not know what would i have got if i said small portiontotally bad experience,1,
"first impressions not a place for breakfast for sure they are not ready for dine in customers
tells you blatantly that your order will take time more than 40 mins before i placed the order i checked in at 8 40 am
ambience is a great miss for sure super duper uncomfortable seats
add
the pancakes are very average could be more fluffy
they did not have waffles so i can not tell
eggs shambles not scrambled over salty in places no salt in rest of the place why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs
tea the only reason i beimg kind and can say 25 is tea lovely tea quite a hassle btw for just tea though ",2,
"i had ordered 2 varieties of shawarma the order reached on time the packaging was good and the shawarmas itself were hot creamy and delicious it was wrapped in foil paper and quantity was sufficient wrt price i used the 50off coupon from zomato i recommend this place

if you found this review useful and think my opinion is justified please hit the  button and maybe even give me a follow i would really appreciate it

just ordered special desi chicken shawarma from this place and was the worst shawarma i had lately very very less chicken filling and dull flavour not at all worth the price,1,
"a good place to have value for money food  the staff is quick to respond and polite  what i did not like was the hygiene as some kind of foul smell was in the restaurant also the lights are not up to the mark which needs to be improved and the temperature inside was kind of hot even in winter

when it comes to food it is very good with good cost and tasty  we had desi shawarma  peri peri and chilli garlic shawarma regular size  all of them were really tasty  their other options are also a must try",4,
ordered pancake breakfast combo quality and packing of food is really good one of the best english breakfast for reasonable cost delivery was also quick,4,
"i aplogize for posting the review so late after a year or so but yes the memories are still fresh in my mind i must say that this one is actually very special to me

this is the first place i came with my best friend he forced me to come out of my room and asked me to decide about the food shawarmas that was it i saw that i could try the vegetarian version here so i was happy

we had our respective types of shawarmas he had chicken and i was more than joyous about having the vegetarian one we got to listen to good music hear the incessant chatterboxes talking out loud but we found silence in our own way and conversed about our ideas it was good food good company and a great experience just that it can hurt your pocket a little",4,
"ordered online

if you hate those colorful add ons on the food same as me better to instruct them before as they add those on all items 
apart from that all good

ordered classic waffle from the foodie monster kitchen gachibowli and it was so yummm beautiful balanced taste no overpowering egg smell a little crisp outside and soft and fluffy inside plus the prices are also reasonable good find will order from here again,4,
i ordered garlic bread and cheesy fries with lots of hope since it had a 40 rating in zomato but sadly it disappointed me to the core  the garlic bread was as small as good day biscuits and very hard to bite while the cheesy fries were very cold and not at all consumable,1,
"i have ordered chicken pizza squares 6pc i waited for almost 20 mins they served 6pc of sandwich bread topped with some chicken i thought that they have served it by mistake i asked the staff and they confirmed that the served thing is called pizza
i wish the name in the menu is changed to something else or mentioning the recipe beside name could help in choosing the right food",2,
the food undoubtedly tasted amazing  ordered crunchy rice bowl will definitely order again however the delivery was delayed by around half an hour so work on the delivery time food is great anyways,4,
"loved it

the shwarmas the fries the garlic bread and all the amazing dips that they serve are lipsmacking 

after eating his full course one still craves to eat more that is how tasty it is 

cheers",4,
it is a small funky place with funky chairs and tables it is a lot bigger than it seems from outside a low key place with less people traffic food is average it is self service there so overall it is an okay place,3,
a sincere request do not try waffles from here tried a nutella waffles priced at rs 199 and they just put half a spoon of nutella on three quarters of waffle expected a lot more disappointed,1,
this place is very common to the corporate people who work in dlf and its premises for its reasonable price and food with perfect quantity and quality the only thing i would suggest everyone is do not opt takeawayhomedelivery for waffles because when hot waffles are made they are immediately stored in plastic boxes due to which hot air is released by the waffles and condenses in the box itself thus it becomes very soft and disgusting to eat i have ordered best of both worlds reg wafflespancakesscrambled eggs and cold coffeeand veg iron monsterpanneer biryani and coke pancakes were yummy along with maple saucescrambled eggs were amazingly toasted without using much oilpanneer biryani was just ok a bit more flavouredcold coffee tasted like regular onepacking quality needs to be improved,4,
they just cancelled the order after an hour this was not at all justified and not at all accepted had a very bad first experience of the restaurant,1,
ice cream low in waffle treat,3,
ordered peri peri fries online today  the fries were damp and cold a suggestion to the restaurant to please not to accept orders if you cannot maintain quality,1,
kindly try putting more stuffing in the waffles we ordered two but it was all bread hence could not eat any ice cream waffle was all melted kindly remove it from online if we are unable to deliver with dry ice banana caramel waffle was all dry expecting better qualities for the next order thanks a lot,2,
"had one of those afternoon sweet cravings so tried this place i ordered a caramel banana pancake

add on  maple syrup i also received a mini waffle for free thanks to zomato free dessert offer both the items are really yummy i would love to try more from here ",4,
"have ordered their mocha waffle and not very impressed with their packing

expected it to be on the softer side considering the time it would take for delivery even then it tasted good

and the peri peri fries too

have bookmarked this place to visit and what a time to give it a try

will look forward to order again",4,
the breakfast was delicious though tea was extra sweet but overall the flavour and aroma was great loved it  great conversation on phone as i modified the order after order was placed,5,
"late night delivery scenes sorted
they have a decent size menu for all kinds of late night hunger had called for anda maggi and a chicken sandwich
packaging can get better but value for he moment in place i am not complaining much",3,
extremely soggy and no flavour at all worst waffle i had,2,
"delivery review
what i ordered  best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which i choose tea
price  199 plus taxes
food review  the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such the scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down  tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3  for me over all if u r health conscious may be it is an absolute visit for u but for me 3 and half for now till next time",4,
service is horrible the food is good tho i do not recommend going here to eat but ordering from or just coming mid day is fine the eggs were well made,5,
toast was a failure,1,
"been to this place for breakfast  choose pancakewaffle breakfast combo
it was good in taste  little disappointed with the waffle though they were soggy but pancakes were really good hash browns were nice
all in all i can say pocket friendly place with decent food",3,
"pathetic food omelete is having black color on it breads are missing strawberry toast  something white is there which smells pathetic food  yakk such bad experience delivery boy also came 1 hour late never gonna order from here ",1,
i have ordered cajun omlet from this place it tasted delicious over the time the quality has declined but immediately it was taken care of when it has been taken to their notice their customer orientation is much appreciated,4,
the person who delivered the order was on time polite and food was good too loved the pancakes and the drink i am definitely ordering again,5,
ordered food from this place which has very interesting menu but not so satisfying tastehoweverthe variety of items which are available seems to be good,3,
cant even give a straw with shakehow am i supposed to drink,1,
loved the shawarmas and chocochip pancakes yummiest everpaneer rice bowl is scrumptious and stomach fillingwill definitely comeback for pancakes and shawarmas,5,
"located in such a place where numerous food courts are available their menu is a real eye catcher pocket friendly with decent quality  quantity
talking about the taste we ordered chicken shawarma combo and rice bowl combo the taste of shawarma did not reach our expectations but the rice bowl combo was really good need to work on the shawarma cuz the taste levels of shawarma is pretty high
regarding the service the waiters were good  humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment their swiping machine was not working so i had to go for an atm which irritated me
management has to look after these issues their ambience is good and clean spent some quality time
food35
service 30
revisit wanna try their whole menu",3,
i ordered the chicken waffle thing and that was really good the shawarma is also pretty good have not tried the desserts but the mini waffle is decent,5,
good service and good food quality really values the customers loved it will definitely go back online to order form the same restaurant again,5,
we visited this place with my friends the place was full with the monster posters the best place for hangout with friends and we recommend this place to all foodies,5,

we ordered nutella chocolate waffle i have never taste a this type of waffle i want to place the order more from this restaurant we are very happy with the food,5,
waffles was awesomebut service is slow restaurant interior was quite goodbut need to improve ur online orderso many times when we order for the item from zomatothe ordered one was not delivered instead of that other item was delivered to the customer,4,
great delivery,5,
tea not served,3,
quantity is not upto the mark rice or biryani is not even sufficient for 1 person,3,
did not taste like it was freshly prepared,2,
i have ordered nutella waffle i was expecting some more nutella on the waffle overall it is ok,4,
"bad cold waffle
stretched like rubber",1,
the food was cold could have been better if it was hot,3,
quantity less but quality good,4,
right on time,5,
the waffles are really good it is served in combo with ice cream and chocolate sauce,4,
"i was feeling like having a late night shake in the pleasant weather and therefore i ordered one through this place

fruit pebble shake was the one which i ordered using zomato but i think they delivered me the wrong one
the shake has the taste of chocolate cookies so it was definitely not fruit

irrespective of that the taste of the shake was average and i think they can improve their bar",3,
food was cool and waste of money late delivary,1,
the quality is coming down the waffles were my fav and now just disappointed,3,
"the best place to chill with some crazy posters i always feel colourful and happy when i hav food there and yes the restaurant guys are so humble and frndly too food is love ",5,
i specially mentioned in message to fry that scrambled eggs properly till crispy brown but they gave it as it is it wasnt cooked properly,3,
the service was goodits a new brand and i think they are developing nowthey have good variety of shawarmamy favourite is tex mex shawarma,4,
"nice pancakes and waffle
loved the fried eggs and tea in the combo",5,
delivered before time great work,5,
i was missing 4 teas but then foodie monster was quicknto followup and ensure that my order was correct i look forward to ordering from them again,5,
"what you must try here
all the rice bowlsboth veg and non veg the varieties of omlette waffelsmonster egg and monster chicken different types of shawarmas french fries and banana pancakes

we went here to bid farewell to one of our friend and tried all the above varieties all turn out be yummy simple and sober

the crews were very friendly and the ambience is super",4,
superb cooperation and order customization,5,
the restaurant did not follow the special instructions mentioned,3,
i had ordered out everytime the packaging is excellent although the food is okayish the shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken the rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist there was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette also their waffles are okayish too,3,
i had pancakes there although they were beautiful plated and heart shaped but taste was not that up to the mark they were bit spongy instead of smooth texture,3,
"had a great experience good place on wekend
if you want to enjoy some awesome food tfmk is the name
ambience of the place makes it a perfect choice to visit with family",5,
"shawarma is not actually a shawarma it is more
like a frankie",2,
how can they not give my full delivery you forgot to deliver my full order,1,
food is awesome it will be great if they allow us to order each item separately instead of just combos,5,
worst service food is not good and people are not polite here very slow service not preffered for professional parties only appearance is good,1,
"this is my third time visiting this place
good ambience for couples
food is absolutely amazing
hirak the staff member is impressive with his attitude and friendly nature
good place for weekend partying",5,
music is good dance floor is quiet big staffs are very friendly drinks are cheap and good do try veg manchurian as starters it was mind blowing,5,
place is a bit small and the music is too loud ambience is ok food is good and they have a very courteous staff the rates are quite resonable,3,
i like this place as it offers quite good buffet with better options and at reasonable price and quite near to my work place drinks prices are some what reasonable,5,
been here with the team  felt that it is a not a place for buffet in starters only chicken wings was good  in main course chicken biryani was gooddesserts was ok,3,
nice place to hang out on a weekday with your colleagues the orders get served quickly and service is courteous good choice of music as well so overall a place i would definitely visit again,4,
"the name is so appealing that when we saw itwe were like yes let is go
because all of us just looovee the movie 
but also because it is on a busy roadside very convenient location

it was wednesday and had a ladies night i think but as you know gold can not be availed with ladies night privileges 

we got seating very easily do not know of that was a good thing or bad because the place was very empty only 2 other tables were seated i think

ambience is okay music can be better cocktails were good you can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it
service can be better was slow  when you look there were very less crowd
food is very nice pocket friendly place

hope next time i get to see a good crowd and good music",3,
"so now this has left me with no option but to write a review after coordinating with the manager mr rounaq ali to get my 678  taxes inr back for the incorrect billing i made the payment for a total amount and when i got back home realised that the bar used my zomato gold coupon but did not apply to the final billing utter disappointment they need to ensure that they do not do an incorrect billing as everyone has trust sorry to say it failed here
k",1,
definitely recommend their kebabs n dance floor used to be one of my favorites their service is prompt and it offers decent mocktails however i would love to see some signature drinks on the menu definitely recommend,4,
"food here is really good but only problem is the lightning it is directly above you and becomes annoying sometimes
but in all i had a good time there",4,
i had visited this place for their lunch buffet which is priced at rs 499  taxes they had 3 veg starters paneer tikka hara bhara kebab and spring roll and 3 nonveg starters chicken tikka fish 65 and also an elaborate main course for the price that they offer the food is pretty good and definitely a go to place if you want to enjoy a buffet,4,
we were 5 friends and i specifically called to ask if stags are allowed manager told that stags are allowed once we reached the bouncer refused us entry saying stags are not allowed on dance floor i called manager again he also denied entry i can not understand why can not they clarify the same on call i spent so much money on cab only to be denied entry la la land sucks,1,
pathetic customer service we called and enquired if stag entry was allowed and they said yes once we reached here stag entry was not entertained when we told we had already called before coming they said we will allow stag but not dance floor why the hell you can not clarify all your nonsense rules over call,1,
"the most horrible and disgusting place i have ever been to they have a big menu to offer but most of it is not available to be served the food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history the waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or english the acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks when we asked for a manger three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we will not pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied arrogant and rude manager showed up his name is ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely did not need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he did not want to do anything about it when i tried explaining him that we would pay the bill add tip and do not want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously he was like if u r leaving leave why are u wasting my time i lost it and i was telling my friend i repeat i was talking to my friend stating what the fuck is wrong with this place is when he interrupts me and says that i need to mind my language i was like what i am talking to my friend about the place what is your problem in that and i literally said sorry even joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai tmko jo karna hai karlo ladkiya he ho na kya ukhaadlogi ukhaad lo so that pretty much defines this place the food and the people do not be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review but yeah if u think u can reach ali a nice lesson please go ahead all my blessings are with you ",1,
this place is one of the finest place and a great attraction is thursday karaoke nights which has been a main attraction and a crowd puller please continue this trend and keep up the good work courteous staff and kj akshay is a friendly guyentertains allthis place is great to unwind after days of hard work please continue and dont ever stop karaokes,5,
the disgusting part is the manager alisuch a disgusting disrespecting person to his customers will never visit this place again the problem is if the manager is so rude just imagine how rude the staff can be,1,
environment was kinda boxed in which was not so appealing  to feeling of being relax but food was great beer was coldcocktails were not so great but then there was a ac in smoking room so yes it can be rated as 3 star,3,
"the food was pretty standard and the service was good ambiance is quite good and the food is worth the price
the only thing that annoyed me to the core was the dj the dj played awful songs which honestly killed my mood
otherwise a good experience",4,
a small cozy place with a dim ambience and loud like very loud music perfect for a bunch friends to hangout drinks and food were good but i felt it was a bit pricey overall we had a good time oh  did i mention they have a dance floor too,4,
"we went for lunch buffet 
very limited options for starter  3 nonveg2 chicken and 1 fish and 3 veg2 potato and 1 paneer they were serving the starter cold the tawa fish was over spicy and they did not prepare a lesser spicy version of that even after our request only chicken wings was good

main course was kind of good egg fried rice and veg noodles were good chicken biriyani was stale

dessert was good chocolate cake gulaab jamoon and ice cream were good semiya kheer was horrible",2,
"well sometimes rating can be misleading we visited the restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine
the beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of corona bucket bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp we were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp and the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer

we asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had dragon chicken served eating it all i can say if it is ur best then your worst is not for humans

next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud

all i can say if you know what a good food ambiance and hang out place never ever visit this place",1,
"they have a good amount of space with decent ambience for large gathering dance floor and a value for price i have been there couple of times and really like their starters specially cheese starter  i do hate their spicy potato starter as it just burns your taste buds 
service is also good and i love their all 99 tuesday menu for starters and drinks as it is all the worth however they should maintain consistency in having all those limited menu items available and not just make an attractive tuesday menu for sake of it
4  mostly because the value for tasty food is worth it hopefully in next visit they do not say we do not have cheese starters in limited tuesday menu ",4,
good food and service as well as classy ambience but music was too loud  i went on a date with my husband here and we had an over all good time  we really liked peanut masala and cocktail collection22 zomato worked perfectly  pepper chicken and corn fritters were good and spicy,4,
"go here only if you want to drink and dance not a place for casual chat

food  57
ambiance 47  tooooo loud music
service  57
vfm  47

we went there for dinner and i was hoping it to be as good as the movie la la land but could not bear the extremely loud music at all it is impossible to talk even with the person sitting next to you

though the taste was decent we could not enjoy the food for the same reason",3,
"very bad service and worst food they showing with coke but they did not send taste is very baddont go this restaurant
very very bad experience with this restaurant",1,
"we wen
t for lunch ala carta today ordered couple of nonveg starters and veg starters all of them are salty and uncooked the quality is also not fresh they are smelly the chicken sheekh kebab is full of dough and no chicken in it

the main course is also awful and the chicken dum biryani is not actually dum biryani it is pulao

please avoid this place

the star ratings are fake",1,
"this is my regular hangout place with my office buddies the food was good thats the only reason for these 2 stars but this review i am writing is after a worst experience in this place last friday we have been to this place and we were looking at menu my friend asked for a drink but floor manager said they do not have that brand then he asked for another brand again same reply then we looked at food menu and ordered chicken lolly pop then floor manager angrily said this is not local bar to ask everything whatever u eat outside then we literally got angry and said this is in your menu that is the only reason we are asking for it then he kept mum we were literally pissed off by that floor manager behaviour and decided not to visit that place again
management need to take action against that floor manager or else they will lose some more regular visitors in future",2,
"this ppl were very irresponsible there swiping machine was not working
but still they have asked us to enter pin for almost 34 times
i have shown a person there that the money was deducted but still he was not agreeing and asked us to do again
nd said if it happens the money will be returned back in 24hrs
but actually very disappointing is
we went there on feb 23rd btw 7 to 8 15
we got a email that there

today on feb 24th at 10am 11 03am the money was again deducted
am asking you very politely if you return them back it is okay
or else am gonna file a case for fraud transaction",1,
"food510
ambience 5510
staff010
music 210
food quantity is less compared to other places  if you are going after 800pm there are chances that food will be served cold to you
not suitable for couples or a group of ladies  only a place for boys to hangout
the only best part about this is that you have a dedicated smoking room",2,
it is good i suggest this to everyone place is good ambiance is ok we danced for few hours it is a chilling environment and foods are available at affordable prices,5,
the foods are awesome place is very noisy even if you cannot here the other person is voice sitting opposite to you dance floor is not at all classy,3,
the food is really below average although they have put a lot of items on their menu all of them lack quality and flavour the service is not at all good nobody is even around you to take your orders or your feedbacks if you are planning to go to this place for food it is really a horrible idea,1,
had a delivery ordered from here makki roti and sarsong ka saag was okay saag tasted more like palak but packing and delivery was good price is on higher side,4,
the maintenance was good with separate smoking area the dance floor was nice with lighting and the food will be supplied to us quickly its my first time going to a pub and i had a lot of fun,4,
have been to la la land their food was so good and the ambiance was also good this is an better alternative to 3b is must try place with cool setup,4,
"this place is picture perfect for the people who have immense love to hang around at the bar counters
this place has a beautiful bar counter
dance floor is too hot and lovely ambiance is too good and warm food is tasty serving is very warm",5,
"we went today for an office team lunch we were around 25 in number and had made prior reservation reached there at sharp 1230 we had to ask the manager to get all the seats as he allotted seats to some other customers despite of our reservations the first started was served 12 hr after we were all seated one plate of starter served by one person to 25 people i had to ask the manager to add few more people to serve but he refused 
after the first serving of 1 veg starter we waited for another 20 mins 
my colleague asked the manager if more veg starters will be served and this was his answer
abhi aap ne kya khaya  panner khaya na woh veg hi hota
we were shocked to see such a response and rude behavior from him
the staff serving the food were courteous but this guy who i think was the manager was extremely rude i finally had to getup and make him realize of his behavior  
starters and food was ok for the price",1,
"food was great  the ambience was okay
crowd not so good
music was good
but there was not much crowd to dance
had fun time with friends
ordered honey chilly potato chicken lollipop paneer lababdar butter naan",3,
la la land is best place for those who love dance and musicwent to this place to celebrate one of my friends bachelorette amd we enjoyed a lotstaff amd service were good,4,
this used to be a good place the service level now is pathetic they will not even offer you the menu unless you ask for it if a dish is served in a bad state it will take ages for you to give the feedback and by the time it is changed your meal would be over and the check ofcourse will take atleast 15 mins to get to youso plan wisely at lol lol land,1,
went out for a team dinner sizing 30 had nonveg starters and biryani limited desserts options food was ok ok 35 waiters have no empathy for customers  very rudelateunprofessional in serving 25 music was too loud very hard to converse with the team 35 ambience is good but looked pretty aged,3,
the ambience was really greatthe starters and desserts were top notchbut when it comes to main courseit is downfallcould do better for main course,3,
"we went here for 31st 2018 evening after reserving table for 3 they told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything so it was 1500 for us 3 and food  drinks charges being seperate we saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine
when we went there for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500 cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee
we always keep cards mostly luckily we had that much cash paid and went inside
got a table for 4 for us 3
so like first mistake of staff when ordered a mojito mocktail as i dont drink and they instead of mocktail send a cocktail  alcoholic drink
second mistake of staff as we are purely vegetarians in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter and they came and served non veg starter
after complaining about this both to staff they apologised and said it will not repeat
now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again again for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a non veg starter again to us
i complained to manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do least
not that i asked for any but that was courtesy on their side
so when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it
ok and the last thing the dj mostly 70 of time was playing very old songs which i again did not enjoy
oh yes and forgot to mention that they had increased prices on drinks and all food and had a whole seperate new menu for 31st december 2018 with increased prices",1,
food is decent and the menu is also good we want for team lunch they serve starters on table rest is a spread service is so so not that great the place the food spread is kept is very congested should be an open area,3,
we went for lunch buffet food taste is average and limited options service is really bad none of them show up when we are asking for food water etc but we got the bill on our table while we are still having deserts,2,
"ambience was superb  food was good  table booking is highly recommended on both weekdays  weekends i visited with family felt very comfortable although it is a barkitchen so it is not the prefect place to hangout with gang but surely can have a try once  initially we planned for ala carte  but went for buffet because ala carte seems expensive compared to other restaurants peaceful experience no distractions what so ever
prefer to have spicy food it is the best place to visit  starters were amazing fish was superb spicy 

i booked a table 1day prior to my visit but still had to wait 45min for table after i entered the restaurant only this was my negative feedback on my visit

7510

thanks",4,
it is a good place to go the ambience can be better the food is above average and the service is fast it can be better by improving the ambience,4,
"rite from the day it opened in hyderabad i wasvery curious to know why the name la la land though m still looking for answer but u happened to visit this place with my husband today on new year fir dinnerwe ordered shorba n lasoon fish tikka for starters n trust md i tasted the best shorba here till date for main course we ordered punjabi kukkad n garlic naan n that was delicious toowe usually dont order desserts but today we thot to n we ordered punjabi pheerni and yumm it was there is nothing that i cn crib about this place rite nowseevice was great as well 4 stars for me ",4,

food 35

we were about 15 people opted for buffet the broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness for starters we had crispy veg perfect chilli paneer very spicy hara bhara kebab  was decent
for main course the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising
desserts were the best the pineapple cake was really delicious and the phirni was creamy and perfect
overall the food was good but can be improved

service 45
very attentive staff who handled 15 people in a very decent and cordial way

overall do visit this place for with friends colleagues and enjoy the drinks and music",3,
the worse service food is worst and can not able to eat deserts they can not even take care of customer the fish starter was even very less items and less spacious,1,

ambience 
one of the best places with great ambience in the city the place is dim lighted but not too dark it is the perfect place to hang out in the evening for a drink

the place will serve you with a good buffet a series of starters and main courses and desserts are just awesome here just make sure you are not late as the buffet strictly closes at 300 pm

hospitality 

the staff is well trained to manage the crowd and at making you feel good",3,
"we went to this place yesterday night for a colleague is farewell party
this is situated adjacent to over the moon hotel in gachibowli

we availed zomato gold and got 22 drinks offer

the staff was not polite and we were dissappointed with their behaviour there were a couple of instances when they did not understand our request and were a bit rude in their behaviour

in starters paneer tikka chilli corn salt and pepper and egg bhurji pao were good in taste and we enjoyed having them
in main course we ordered dal makhani and paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations

nothing can be better than having a dessert to end the evening and we did the same by ordering gulab jamun
i must say it was one of the best gulab jamun is i have had until now

wanted to give them 35 rating but deducting 05 for staff behaviour",3,
"this place is a play of light and shadow beautifully organized and carefully decorated with cushions and low height sitting areas
we had lunch buffet and it was really nice
welcome 1 goodlooking and thirstreleiving welcome drink with veg or nonveg soup
starters 3 veg dishes  veg tikki babycorn and hariyali paneer tikka 3 nonveg dishes  fish plates chicken wings and chicken kebabs

desserts it had gulab jamun rasmalai firni 45 types of sweets 3 types of pastries ice cream and whole lot of fruits

the experience was really nice and each and every dish came with awesome deliciousness",4,
"we went on friday night for corporate team dinner  eventually we made a right choice to go to this place 
the place has 2 sections where there is nice comfy sofa arrangements with dim lights ideal place to date  and other end has normal arrangements facing dj and dance floor 
down to food
the chinese non veg starters was cooked brilliantly  the best items to have dragon chicken and crispy chilly wings 
even alcoholic drinks were pretty cheap standout drink was long island iced tea surprisingly they had bira too 

waiters reacted quickly to us although it was pretty jam packed 

overally experience was awesome for a friday night ",5,
been love 5 time over the course of last 23 months and i just love the foodhere be it veg or non veg never failed to disappoint the only thing that they should do something about their menu,5,
the dim lights make it perfect spot variety of gold available not that heavy on the walletbest to book a table and go especially on weekends,5,
"went for lunch and opted for buffet dark and nice ambience you will like it as soon as you enter
notably paneer tikka and chicken wings were very good staff could be a bit more responsive and we waited around 10 min just to pay the bill and did not accept payment through nearbycom app reasoning a lame reason that we do not know
rest all was good
note location in zomato is not accurate please google it",4,
"they do not seem to use good quality ingredients for the food they serve
went for vegetarian buffet
lot of variety to try on starters were decent  same for the main course but the desserts were horrible",2,
"amazing staff
great prompt service
amazing food
dj is great
came here for a birthday party and they totally made it a night we can not forget
anybody in hyderabad should definitely visit this place atleast once
waiting to visit this place a lotmore times",5,

a lovely place with good ambience and friendly staffthey serve good food at reasonable prices enjoyed my visit to the place with friends on a weekend,4,
very good place to visit and i can  promise you wont find a better place with the combination of best  price list with this ambience and the staff,5,
the ambinence was good but the food was nt that much of good which i expected from them the staff was rude and nt proffesional worst experience that i ever had in my life,2,
"the ambience is pretty decent it is a moderate space to hangout with friend is in the evening good food staff are so polite
over all it was good place to visit again",4,
very spicy food even the soup was ultra spicy starters were average main course could have more variety and some taste even the desserts were not good,1,
pathetic food slow service extremely spicy food went there for a team lunch and it was the most disappointing food i ever had even the fruits were stale,1,
"this is first time i arrivle at here it was great experienceamince goodfood not so goodoveral nice experience

"worst place for teetotalers
serving time is very late u get a feeling like why did i came here
kindly refrain urselves
good if you are here for drinks",1,
great food and ambience if you are looking for a time out with your friends then it is a good place to visit service is really nice here would like to mention bimal specifically as he has been such a great host to us,5,
the music is so loud we have requested them many times to reduce the sound but our voice was not heard we could not talk to each other never going to visit the place,1,
very bad customer service booked a table for 6 before and when reached there they are arraging 4 people table really worse seating,1,
"average food quality went there for team lunch

they should increase the number of starters in their buffet menu the pastries and brownies in the dessert section were hard

the main course was good the paneer butter masala was very good in taste also their veg pulao is worth trying

overall good place to give a try",3,
just now had a buffet lunch and right now in restaurant only and writing this review not much option for vegetarians service is pathetic as we have to ask for starters and they are not serving and waited for 10 mins and had main course after that they served remaining starter dessert were not at all good in quality,1,
an amazing place with great ambience and lovely music we went for their lavish lunch buffet and it was a great experience malai tikka and chicken wings we are amazing and so was dhana chicken they served one of the best phirnis i have tasted a great place to hangout,5,
be polite and friendly staff food is very good and dj dance floor is very nice me and my friends very happy so noce place the best pub in the hyderabad city wow thanks all staff,5,
though the ambience and food was good especially been here to make some moves on the dance floor when we have gotten over the floor bouncer refrained us from dancing on the floor and asked us to move away which was utterly disappointing,2,
"ambience very relaxing seething and decoration are good 

went with friends for buffet
we have been welcome very gracefully 

the restaurant was not crowd we got comfortable seating

soup and snack has been served on the table for main course we have helped ourself

service was very good and impressive

now coming to food all the dishes are awesome good taste and rich quality

total value for money recommended",5,
went here with friends expecting this to have some cool jazz music because of it is namelmao but it was still a nice experience everybody enjoyed their drinks and the food was good the dacefloor is not half bad either if there are not too many people dancing,4,
"this restaurant has its priorities straight unlike ab is flechazo and barbeque nation that swing for the fences and end up failing many times this place has hit a sweet balance between hospitality and taste

which means you have none of the irritating fakefriendly overeager monkeys from the abovementioned places pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you do not want to

instead you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business until you order for something very professional indeed

the starters are awesome here they actually set the tone for the things to come this place features a widerange of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well which is a big step up from its competitors kebabs are to die for

having said that the main meal was nothing to write home about they have tried a lot of things from mughlai intercontinental to chinese but somehow these dishes do not come together on the plate

but what actually took my heart away what this joint excels in handsdown compared to any freaking restaurant in the city is the desserts department for someone who loves sweets it is a psychedelic experience

the variety and taste will haunt you for days the desserts are neither too sweet nor too rich just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about

i was thoroughly satisfied and if you leave out the cloveheavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu then the place is a rockarolla discovery definitely worth one visit and then the count will just keep on ticking",3,
this place opened last year and is a small place but is very happening  the evening i went there was an office party going on and there was a buffet catered for them this place has a small dance floor and nice interiors they have a huge variety in their food and alcohol menu and they taste amazing they even have a lunch buffet menu at a reasonable price do visit this place if you are in gachibowli,4,
veg biryani they serve here is too good and loved itlocated very well nearby to it sector dlf gate 3 can be more better and improvements can be made as demand is high in this area,3,
"very bad biryani ordered fry biryani but they brought dum biryani instead of changing they mixed and made food so much worse

do not encourage such restaurants where customers are not treated well and food is as bad as it gets",1,
worst experience ever food was spoiled and the same was informed to the staff but not even got a response from them atleast they should have some concern on the customers even after informing about the taste they just handed over the bill without even checking my issue this type of service will not earn anything this will be my last visit to this restaurant,1,
extremely rude staff and costing like anything if u see there place and food ur going to feel like why the hell you are herefood quality 05,1,
"this place does not even deserve 1 star

the worst ever experience which i have ever faced
zero taste zero service no ac nor fan the staff has no basic respect nor they are worried about the customer

the food served was rotten  no proper hygiene was maintained

the restaurant manager mr anwar was rude towards customers do not know why they are running this hotel

completely zero",1,
"if you want to have gud foodthen dont order in this restaurantthey will prepare latezomoto asusally worst delivery serviceno one lift your phone call at restaurant

think twice before u order with owm nom nom
dontorderowmnomnom",1,
"i went there to have to have chinese cuisine but i did not like the food ordered hot n sour soupamerican chopsuey both were not up to the mark and the prices were high ",3,
best quality food with rich spicy taste in reasonable price biryani lovers you can try for special chicken price  the staffs and manager is very coperative,5,
"if you love spicy food enrich with taste and good quality then this is the bestest place to have your food  must must try is afgaani chicken and fry biryani  and and kaju paneer as well ",5,
we had a worst experience waste of money no courtesy pathetic quality of food they serve cuddle milk soup instead of cream of mushroom server argue and justify you place wrong order old fish cheap oil they use we paid our bill and had to left food without eating never to visit this place again,1,
today i have received worst biryani getting some smell previously i have ordered so many times then it was good today i do not know what happened,1,
food is not good it is below average and too costly  moreover their behavior is not polite restaurant is not hygiene as well  the smell is bad   when you are into food business have some respect for customers,1,
"the waiters are super slow the cutlery used in the restaurant are not even clean hygiene is a big issue here coming to the food it is nothing extraordinary except the fact that the taste is close to home made food but again the usage of oil is much more biryani and tandoori are the safest options here keep a track of what you are ordering because the bill might not come right check it before paying i found a dish added in the bill which i did not order when pointed out the waiter seemed to be confused

this place if it has a target of survivingneeds to improve a lot in terms of food taste consistency service and most importantly hygiene",2,
"i have been there 2to 3 times but this time i had the worst experience waiter was in some othe worls we asked him to bring something and he ordered something
at the time of serving food the waiter told us paneer is there but paneer tikka is not available and the hilarious part was we did not order paneer tikka so what we ordered in veg in that also it did not had paneer at the time of billing they create a lot of chaos
so i had the worst experience",1,
"very good place but we need to wait so long for the food to deliver us they serve the customers very good responsewe had murgh malai kabab and muuton briyani with our office colleagues very good in taste i like the grren chutney which they serve with malai kabab ",3,
"place located just opposite of dlf gate no 3 which is very much easy to reach just reached this place to explore some of their expertise dishes and found lost 
food quality and staff slowness made me horrible
seems they have done some renovation recently which give something new and good feeling but to be honest in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service and if this is not maintained then there is no meaning 
all the best guys and please do some deep thinking and improve the food quality and service part",1,
ordered tandoori chicken from here trust me never expected this kind of taste from this place taste was really awsome compared to other tandoori places in gachibowli definitely will go for it again,5,
ordered chicken lollipop as a starterbut received them as burntsalty and wet instead of dry snack egg fried rice was ok chicken kadai curry was not tasty at all chicken seems to be old stock veg rolls looked like dosa roll instead rolls should be crispy with stuff not coming out did not like the food at all  i am not gonna order it from here again price also on the higher side but food is not worth the price,1,
the service is not good the plates are not cleanly washed they are not serving properly look at the picture how worst the spoon and bowl,1,
"tried two dishes  chicken biryani and mushroom biryani both tasted good initially but as the ghee content was more the taste was not very good ",3,
ordered a lime soda with biryani recieved lime soda in used kinley soda bottle opened half filled this is ignoring basic hygine and acceptable packaging the restaurant is risking people health not sure what else they will be compromising on,1,
painfully slow delivery exceedingly oily and bland definitely not recommending it they gave us all kinds of odd and inconsistent reasons for the delay so not satisfied by the whole experience sorry,1,
a perfect place for biryani lovers looking out for pocket friendly options i ordered veg biryani and both the quantity and quality was perfect 55,5,
ordered chicken fried piece biryani with an advice of my colleague after eating i am suggesting the same to my friends and colleagues to eat and order at own nom nom,4,
food was not goodits from yesterday is food with less quanityi asked to customer care some one told they will refund and after 10 mins some one told not possiblewithout giving proper food you people are charging and telling we are sorryif you will go for old chat alsosame issue i am facing maximum timesthis service is very bad services provding zomatoi will put a complain to food inspection teamthey will definitly take a actionzomato is full of fraud serviceit shuold stopsome times delivery guys are eating customers food sometimes providing 2 days back food to customers,1,
not good service and not speak good always argument,1,
really really bad spring rolls smelled really weird like it is rotten or pukeoil used or some sauces might have gone wrong extremely oilynever seen anything like that just wrapped it in tissues and yet over flowing oil squeezed into the sink honestly could not eat it obviously because of the smell and oil,1,
ordered egg biryani for deliverypacking is goodtaste is goodbiryani quantity is sufficient for one personbut given only one eggwould have been better if given one more,3,
i did not get my raita,4,
certainly the top rated it got the tongue tickling taste worth reorder food is clean and fresh no issues so far good luck and keep going,5,
delivered before than expected,4,
"worest management
they do not even know the features in delivery
they are refusing to give my own order to myself
even after waiting for hours management does not respond
if you want to waste money and time
please visit to this restaurant
this is not the first time we are facining this problem
several times it happened
they do not even respond to phone calls on customer care number",1,
excellent delivery in time,5,
i ordered chicken fry biriyani but they had delivered normal chicken biryani i was expecting a fried chicken piece instead i found a boiled chicken piece the overall taste is fine,3,
i ordered paneer kulcha but it is not according to my expectationstheir was only the name of paneer but no paneer,3,
very good one,5,
biriyani rice was not boiled properlyit was hard,2,
very bad got stale food in chicken biryani parcel there was no improvement or apologies from them when we shared the feedback to the team,1,
taste is okay and ambience is just fine but my experience with service here is not satisfied do not know whether i visited wrong time but to be honest cost and quantity is worthy,3,
"this place would have got more if the staff and the service improved their behavior

have been this place to several times just because of the taste of the food and with the hope that staff behavior would improve but always i come back dissapointed

food45 main course at this place is very good biryani is not out of this world but tastes good

the restaurant as a whole has gone renovation and it is upgraded to become ok type ambience

pathetic food even a roadside chinese cart would be much better rice is not fried it is just over red in color no schezuan flavour at all hardly any mushrooms that too not fresh not even salt was added and there were onions that too rotten given with a chinese dish do not know what kind of chef or a restaurant it is,1,

the food is good i really liked the starters and jeera rice was great the ambience is okay but the service is bad like real bad the second time i visited the place the guy spilled the lime soda on me and the plate i could not even have my starters ya he did not even serve them again which he was supposed to the worst part was the attitude,3,
the food was not up to the mark i just could not eat a bit the so called special raju gari pulao was just a nightmare do not recommend to anyone,1,
"ambience 55
food  being a vegetarian could not find a lot of options but the food is tasty except for some dishes which completely ruin the day 45",4,
nice ambiance we had guthivankaya pulao and it is like kind of ok not so great  pocket friendly they have different items in menu but taste wise can be little more better,3,
"too much expensive for the quantity served not worth the money most items in the menu are not available

taste is just average not recommended",1,
one of the best place to serve andhra delicacies in hyderabad i love the pulaos here their speciality dishes are definitely a treat little expensive i must say overall good place,4,
"one of the best food experience in hyderabad
raju gari kodi pulav unique and mouth watering
quantity is very less compared to other similar level of restaurants",5,
"went for lunch to this place on friday it was full crowded and we waited for almost 1hr if you want to go this place first reserve the table
coming to the taste it was awesome we had raju gari kodi palav ulavacharu biryani and chicken vepudu all were really good and serving also very fast",5,
"the food was good as usual but the service is become worse the waiters are ignorant and lame not attending tables  even for the menu we had to menu multiple times not attending the table even after calling them multiple times it was not even a busy business time

request the management to have them trained it just th food which is bringing us here",1,
ordered gadwal kodi pulav it had no salt no resolution on it even after complaining that it had no salt the quantities served are very less so everyone who think one pulav will serve two to need to order one for each,1,
me and my friend went for authentic south indian pulao and boy the dishes are really tasty we had kodi pulao and it was super tasty definitely going to go again,5,
"this place is worse you will see flies and do not have courtesy to the customers
zomato accept the booking and restaurant will not accept",1,
reservation confirmed for 11pm shows open till 1130pm denied dining on arrival without prior intimation saying kitchen closed by 1030 pm and that they are not on zomato,1,
"undoubtedly pocket friendly place
we had chicken sambar rice and leaf wrapped roasted chicken we also had curd cutlet which was super yummy",4,
if u are a non vegetarian and if you r craving for some good authentic telugu foodthis is the place to betheir raju garu pulao is one of its kindguntur billal mutton biryanikodi chips and gadwal pulaothese were the dishes we had and trust me they wer just exceptionalhighly recommend this place,4,
"nice and friendly place to be in the ambiance is great and nature colour has been use to make the place nice and appointed
i could the service to be very good and friendly
we ordered for bamboo chicken and chicken pulav both the dishes were nicely presented
spice content was high has always in hydrabad cuisine bamboo chicken was well done with nice aroma and taste
pulav was served in nice quantities sufficient for more the one person chicken tender and rice perfect
seems will need to pay more visits to try other combinations
as a compliment a very nice mysore paak was offered great taste 
will visit again",3,
"wow ulavacharu i never ever knew your biryanis are so freakin awesome

so i happened to go here by chance as my friend suggested we should just try this place and my god me being eggatarian obvious i ordered for an egg biryani what presentation and what taste usually you just get the egg booked on top of the rice but here they cut it and the spice is inside of the cut egg how cool and tasty i did have some before like this but this this taste yummmmm kudos

however they have done complimentary sweet for everyone the day i went there that was not all that good way to sweet uhh and my friend is a nonvegetarian he had some chicken biryani and sure he licked his fingers awesome ulavacharu i am coming back soon thankyou",5,
worst service food quantity is very less even the ac temperature was high i suggest not to visit this place ridiculous thing was thums up and water was served hot,1,
"i got to know about this place from a tv show so went to try some biriyani ordered kotha chicken and bamboo chicken which is a must try
ambience4
food taste42
staff4",5,
rustic ambience was good the prawn and crispy veg starters were very average the andra style curry was good complimentary laddoo tasted yummy overall decent place but nothing amazing as far as the food is concerned,3,
too expensive and is served with very less quantity went with family and it was disappointing as many of menu items werent available and poor service not so great and it can be skipped,2,
been here with parents ordered hot and sour soup and pachi mirchi pulav the soup was a bit spicy but tasty the pulav was to the point neither spicy nor bland,4,
though this food chain has got some fame i totally disagree with it for the experience we had on our friday lunch poor response and tardy service management failed to take care of the waiters who were very few around the tables waiters has to be augmented along with swiftly handling the services,2,
"heaven for people who love spicy food
head here if you have spicy nonveg craving order the fried chicken and biryani and oh god just wait for the spice gods to come and sit next to you to bless you

ulavacharu ftw",5,
the worst experience ever ordered achari ghoshti it came with more salt later asked him he repaired the remaining curry after half an hour also the service was too slow and pathetic,1,
this is one of a place where you will not be disappointed everything is good right from starters to main course to deserts nice service by sri and team,5,
"a lot of people suggested this place for some real spicy food had been there twice and in fact the first time i went there i knew that whenever i have guests at home i need to bring them here nicely done interiors  the antique door and the idol at the entrance very beautiful and welcoming
coming the food this tile we we are welcomed with some ghee mysore pak yummy the staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken fish and mutton biryani pulao delicious  full of masalas and tasty nothing to complain about the food bamboo chicken was the star dish  it just melts in your mouth
so it is a place for some really fine dining on fridays and weekends do make a reservation the have some crazy waiting 
definitely recommended",5,
"this place gives a strong telugu vibe taste of the food is little spicey i ordered bengali kodi and bamboo chicken in starter it was good and in main course took ulavacharu special fried rice which is little spicey in dessert ordered kulfi which is very less amount as compared to price

good thing about the resturant is it has a decent ambienceservice was generous",3,
great decor however it does not match with the name wonderful atmosphere ulavachru biryani was exceptional and starters as well excellent service and a nice place to enjoy food with family,5,
"food and ambiance are great here but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity service was too slow and can not able to manage things

we ordered raju gari kodi pulao chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste  

overall review raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao",3,
the name of this food place and the ambiance is amazing food is expensive here meaning high cost and less quantity the taste is good it is advice to them to train their servers to get knowledge of all the items on the menu,3,
awesome place very good ambiance good variety in food polite  helpful staff  music also gives andra feel best veg pulav in hyderabad,5,
"one of the most recommended places to enjoy authentic andhra cuisine been here multiple times and tried many dishes they never let us down as soon as we enter we were offered with complimentary sweet  jalebi sometimes they forget in so you can ask for it
among starters bamboo chicken and bangla kodi are my favorites
bamboo chicken is very tender and it gets cooked inside a hollow bamboo stick and its sizzling hot with yummy taste
bangla kodi is very unique with each chicken piece wrapped in a sliced potato this is a must try
they have got a wide range of main course to cater to everyone is need i have tried prawns vepudu pulav this is the dish to go for if you like prawns spicy yummy tasty fulfilling and satiating
pachi mirchi kodi pulav and gadwal kodi pulav are great too raju gari kodi pulav is their signature dish but it will be soggy so not everybody may like it
do not forget to cool off your taste buds with rose milk or junnu in the end
ambiance is soothing and sets the right atmosphere for a great meal service is bit slow and could be improved
no issues with parking they have got valet",4,
"ordered nellore chapala pulusu and andhra kodi kura both are worst awful tasteless pathetic
dont waste your money and time  complete useless stuff",1,
the ambience is good but the food took too long time to arrive at the table we ordered some 3 kinds of pulav items but had to cancel them due to delay,3,
ulavacharu is well known for its taste but the service i received today was the worst and this is not the first time even after complaining to the manager about it he did not even apologize for it and moreover he delivered me mutton instead of chicken and when asked about it he was like this is chicken and he tried blaming me instead  the way they behaved was worst  manager named veera babu was very rude too he was not even responding whatever we ask he said i am the sole owner and no one is above me even after we paid the bill they behaved rude i do not recommend going here,1,
went here for dinner with my big time foodie friend surya tej kanuri he only recommended the place and i liked it as we entered they served complementary badusha and it was good both of us being nonvegetarian we ordered fish bamboo chicken mutton biryani and some regional dessert which i am not aware of also they have limited number of desserts and some of them were not available with bill they do serve paan,4,
"ulavacharu is one of the best south indian cuisine here i have tried in hyderabad city being a north indian oppps west bengal is not considered as a northern state so being an east indian my first step for an authentic andhra rochulu am i pronouncing right went pretty good the ambience decoration  presentation were amazing food taste was amazing they serve 2 laddoos as complimentary when you sit on the chairs overall a good experience
i exactly forgot the names of those 3 dishes we ordered but junnu in desert was something different i never tried before mildly sugary desert made from fresh cowmilk custard pie type was amazing",5,
"very bad experience with this place ordered lemon corriender soup with godavari royyala vepudu soup is good in consistency but high on sourness not really good royyala vepudu was good but not hot looks like they prepared an hour ago after that we ordered gadwal kodi pulao which is my worst experience ever it is an highly spiced rice which a normal person can not eat
ambience and service is very good but not the food",1,
the place is really nice and gives a very strong telugu vibe nice old songs to go with courteous service we ordered for chicken fry pulav and sweet corn soup sweet corn soup was ok the pulav was really good but really spicy which was expected suggestion would be to order a boneless pulav instead also we finished with a veg ulavacharu biryani the veg option was disappointing should stick to non veg pulavbiryani and boneless,3,
i visited this place first with my friend s and late with office colleagues place was very good like ambience service food quality try koramenu it will be very good,5,
very very bad sooo waste taste less dont take order onlinevery very bad sooo waste taste less dont take order online very very bad sooo waste taste less dont take order online,1,
"food  4
ambience  3
service  3

bamboo chicken and raju gari kodi pulao is a must try here prawns and chicken roast is okay service is little slow and messy ambience can be improved a little good place to try the authentic andhra dishes",3,
"the place does not serve your booking request you have to still wait an hour to get the table even after doing a booking it just completely spoils the mood ",1,
"wanted to have some good authentic andhra food and ulavacharu did not disappoint me  loved the food even though it was a bit spicy  the masam vedupu pulao and the masam miriyala are a must try here  the andhra kodi kura did not quite live up to my expectations though  ended the meal with the rajahmundry rose milk which also ticked the box service was fantastic throughoutoverall enjoyed my experience here and would recommend this place to people looking for spicy authentic andhra food  cheers 
ps extra points for the motichur ladoo they gave us as a welcome snack ",4,
authentic south indian flavours i loved the biryani this is for the first time i tried some biryani truely n completely different from other restaurants in hyderabad,4,
"food is not great for the price ulavacharu veg pulao or ulavacharu by itself was not to the taste
not a great place for vegetarians heard good about non veg options",2,
i visited 3 month ago it was good but it was very spicy  ans somewhat costly also interior is good as well behavior of stap members,4,
"i got to visit this place through a giveaway by hyderabadfooddiaries and it was worth a visit we tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine the rajugari kodi pulao was the best of all
this pulao had a different taste and texture unlike biryani this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry this place has huge variety of appetizers curries and rice in chicken muttonseafood and veg options

"been to this place with my friends today let me start with the good part first ordered bamboo chicken as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge

as part of main course we ordered rayala vari kodi pulao which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity next comes the dish which was hyped raju gari kodi pulao they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good

in short good place but pricing is bit high value for money 3 out of 5
bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing inr 435 is high for the quantity we get",3,
"it is worst place to dine

too much hyped

last sunday we visit this with my friends i tried here bamboo chicken n pachi mirchi kodi pulav both not at all up to the mark",2,
"was there for new years eve the ambiance is great and so was the staff but it was overpriced by almost 50 and mutton was not cooked well

fish vepudu though was finger licking good

would have been 3 stars but reduced two because of pricing and poor mutton dish",1,
we went on the new year day menu was limited we waited 1 hour almost to get our food on the table service was horrible due to rush food was not that tasty we ordered rajugari natu kodi pulao which was bland we ordered kothmira kodi kura as curry with roti it was just ok but less spicy we ordered junnu for desert which was the only good thing amongst all the dishes bit the quantity was so less for the price overall it is too much hyped restaurant with ordinary tatsing food at expensive rate my suggestion better look for other options do not go during festive seasons it is crazy crowded,2,
ambience was goodwent on a busy afternoonordered mamsam roastwas okayishthen ordered ulavacharu chicken pulao and pachi mirchi royyala pulaoulavacharu chicken was goodroyyala pulao was nothing specialservice can definitely improve,3,
have been to this place couple of times though it is expensive you will have a chance to taste few amazing starters like bamboo chicken kotha kodi and variety of pulaos the food here has authentic andhra taste,4,
"this is such a over rated stupid place i really dont know why is this even liked by people
food was very bad service too
menu is an ocean and taste is nill
i dont think they will survive over time quality has come down soo bad",1,
after hearing from my friends suggestions i had prawns fry and chicken biryani they need to improve food taste and quality my dinner at ulavacharu food is okay,2,
"too much hyped

heard a lot about this restaurant but finally it ended up with a disappointment mainly the pulav is
initially we were offered complementary sweetstried pachi mirchi kodi pulavoorugallu veg pulavkotha kodi  crunchy curd cutlet

pachi mirchi pulav  was nice but lacked the expected spicinessthough its a medium varient
oorugallu veg pupav mostly tasted like normal rice but the spice mix was quite authentic tasted like baby onions coocked with mango picklequite a different experience never had one like this before
kotha kodi just an edited version of chicken majestic
crunchy curd cutlet  good but too oily

finally ended the meal with a dessertjunnu which was good of all the items i had in the restaurant

good thing about the restraunt is it had a decent ambience and can accommodate quick a good numberservice was generous but a bit slow

overall food taste was just ok lacked the heatcan be improved a lot",3,
if you want something really spicy try ulavacharu starters are very tasty especially the peanut chicken and good to listen to old songs,5,
"great ambience and awesome food served here onion rings curd cutlet godavari royyala vepudu bamboo chicken are must try starters pachi mirchi kodi palau raju gari kodi palau and gadwal kodi palau are good options for main course

ps try their rajamundry rosemilk too",4,
"they tried to create authentic experience right from the ambiance food is a real treat especially for those who like andhra cuisine bamboo chicken raju gari kodi pulao guthivankaya pulao are a must try the only drawback is the service which is slow

ambiance  455

service  45

food  55

vfm  455",5,
have been to this place after hearing lot of good reviews i can rate the food as very deliciousspecially pachimirchi kodi pulao accurately spicy varied dishes in the menu but i had a very bad day with respect to servicefirst of all there were hardly 2 waiters who were available and even though it was not crowded they were unable to address the customers and were confused with the menu as once they said bamboo chicken was not available and then when ordered some other starter came back with bamboo chicken secondly after some time those 2 waiters were missing and the whole floor was left without anyone to take care of guests i hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldnt be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own,3,
this place is simply amazing with authentic telugu menu and the food presentation lovely ambience and equally tasty food  there is a complimentary jalebi and at the end masala pan which is a very nice gesture  overall a very good experience,4,
"a nice place to taste some of the local delicacies
i really liked the rusty feel this place has which takes you back in ages
loved the started although pulao was not the best i have had
overall a nice dine out",4,
one of the best biryani is i have had in hyderabad ambience is awesome with copper glasses plates with banana leafs service was fast on a sunday afternoon and the taste was delicious ulavacharu veg pulao mokkajonna vepudu filled my appetite would definitely visit to try other items,4,
this is my favorite restaurant always but i dont know this time the service was very bad taste of food is always awsome herevery disappointed with the staff need to ask everything thrice and more,4,
nice placefood was good we had sambar rice which was yummy guti vankaya pulav was avgwe had gadwal pulav which was decent and other starters was also pretty decentbut some items which are mentioned in the starter menulike mirchi bajji are always not availablemanagement should be looking in to this,3,
food was awesome but expensive food was awesome but expensive food was awesome but expensive food was awesome but expensive food was awesome but expensive,5,
the food was different from what i ordered and this is 2 nd time i think will nvr order again,1,
great  ambiance tried avakaya biryani tastes awesome i would rate food 55 ambiance 55 service 15 if u plan to come please get your water because they will not offer you water until you request them waiters sai  is busy in doing his works the way he communicates is more like road side restaurant,2,
good service,5,
"food is very tasty we ordered more than 5 times from same place and every time we feel the same
pandu mirapakaya starter is veg starters is superb",5,
went to this place with colleagues for a lunch good ambience and good food sums up this place bangla kodi was very unique  chicken pinned with crispy fried potato we ended up ordering another plate of it must try at this place,4,
"food 1
ambience 5
serving 4
food is not so tasty
i prefer not go to this restaurant when u want to enjoy ur food u can go if u want abidence
we have ordered both veg and non veg but not all satisfied",1,
"i wanna give 10 but i can not  i simply love it  if i wana spend time with the family the first restaurant come to my mind is this because the retro songs and the old recipes they have make it a best combo  i simply love it ",5,
"i had huge expectations on food based on the review but taste was not up to the mark and staff is not customer friendly
not recommended to anyone",2,
visited ulavacharu with my son who are both non veg lovers the food was good but the quantity was very less for the price that was paid we ordered raju gari kodi pulav which costed around 400 and the meat was very less in it,3,
"food  4
vfm  35
ambience  35
service  35

we ordered bamboo chicken and pachi mirchi kodi pulao both the dishes had fresh ingredients
bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy it is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in it also has dry gravy so it is not entirely a good choice for starters will go well with any indian bread
pachi mirchi kodi pulao was awesome the rice was flavorful chicken curry served over it was semi  gravy and yummy as well the chicken was nicely complementing the rice
service can be improved a bit will go again to this place to try other dishes",4,
nice service,5,
i ordered raju gari kodi palav from this pathetic senseless restaurant why the hell there is water in raju gari kodi palauo it is full of water i have to heat and boil it again to take water out and it became paste is this how you serve customers pathetic i am never going to order again from this restaurant stupid restaurant,1,
"amazing food ordered
bamboo chicken  above avg
chicken vepudu  great
chepala vepudu  great
raju gari kodi pulao  above avg
andhra kodi pulusu  great

rated 45 because of noise or else would have rated it as 5",4.5,
first of allexcellent ambience perfect for family gatherings  coming to food we ordered bamboo chicken  raju gari kodi pulav  korameenu vepudu  kodi vepudu pulav and my favorite junnu which were okay in taste but the starters were delicious,3,
"extremely disappointed with the food tastewe have ordered kodi roast which was average when compared to godavari royyala vepuduwe usually expect dry item when it is named as vepudu but we got gravy and semi gravy itemssame experience with two more items kakathiya mamsam vepudu biryani and kodi vepudu biryani
even the prices are extremely highif taste is better no one would be bothered about price",2,
the service was very fast and taste was awesome the ambience was super and raju gari kodi pulao was very tastytotally everything is awesome,5,
lovely ambience and equally lovely tasty food  best part is the valet parking good variety of options of authentic food we had starters main course and appetisers  there is a complimentary jalebi and at the end masala pan which is a very nice gesture  overall a very good experience,4,
been there with the hype by waiting for 30 mins nearly for the table meanwhile looking at the authentic theme on a sunday for lunch and management finally provided us a table and we have ordered few items in which ulavacharu biryani is yummy  service can be better,4,
delivered late,4,
heard so much about this restaurant and went to enjoy the weekend dinner but the rotis were served cool and the curry is full of oil inspite of complaining to concerned staff there was not much difference try to avoid ulavacharu if you want to have a tasty and healthy food,1,
this is best place compared to all other restaurants of ulavacharu in hyd service is very quick and obviously tasty food if you are looking for spicy dish try chicken fried piece biryani you would love itthis place is highly recommended,5,
"i have been here twice and the food was yummy yummy i say
ambiance was kind of historic type with all wooden sculpture kind it was nice 
we have tried pandumirchisticks which is my fav till date
coming to ragi sankati  it has disappointed me a bit i expected it to be more tasty but it was not bad
over all you can enjoy there with yummy food",3,
the ordered food was not good spoilt,1,
comimg out of a restuarnt with full satisaction after a long long time kotha kodivepudu loose prawns bamboo chicken chapala vepudu natu kodi pulsu andra kodi kura ragi sankati evevry thing was perfect except konasema kodi vepudu was a little spicy special mention really quick service,5,
most of my star rating goes to the ambience herethis place is simply amazing with authentic telugu menu and the food presentationprices are on higher side though for the ambiencespice lovers must visit the place to satisfy their hunger,5,
the experience from the jubilee hills outlet led us to try this one with colleagues on a couple of occasions and we were not disappointed this place lives up to its reputation as a destination of choice for andhra delicacies check it out,4,
"no taste in food starters were served cold probably it was already cooked so waiter suggested us that dish it is expensive and not worth at all they are trying to be over authentic and spoiling the basic taste of food

rotis are very hard and ulavacharu biryani is too much masala and no tasty

not suggested to visit",1,
i had a family lunch today at ulavacharu gachibowli natukodi kaju vepudu was seriously bad in taste chicken higeneness when we complain about the same staff did not respond in proper manner,1,
good place for team visits  ordered raju gari kodi pulav and bongulo chicken both tastes great ambience is good place can be extended to have more seats it is always over crowded  a must visit place,4,
"india is a food nation every 50 kms you travel from one point to another the tastespices and the approach changes andhra pradesh and telangana is no different andhra the way they cook their dishes is more earthy and less spicy compared to telangana cuisine rayalseema being all healthy as they use raagi spices are very earthy why am i preaching this because all these varieties are to be found in ulavacharu

ulavacharu is a vibrant telugu brand having branches throughout hyderbad banjarahills gachibowli etc

their unique dishes names taste especially their crispy chicken skin although a little tweeek is much needed to the palatte of hyd so overall the setup is amazing it just does not serve food it gives you an experience a must visit place points to consider for restaurant their rose milk is a bad imitation of rajamundry they serve fruitpunch naming it as rajamundry so as i said tweeks are much needed

45 is my rating",4,
the moment you enter the restaurant the ambience is goodwe ordered godavari royalla vepudu that was goodthen we ordered gadwal kodi pulao was ok their sambar rice was so sour more of citrus taste that was not at all acceptable,2,
so when i went with my parents i observed the restaurant was jampacked with people i swear it was difficult to get to our seats also in a way i could not appreciate the ambiance much we ordered ulavacharu vegetable pulao and what i believe was pandu mirapakaya i hope i am right the food was tasty wellmade with a slightly different mix of spices from the usual i enjoyed the rice and the flavor it had having never tried any rice item of that sort it felt like a novel burst of flavors to my restless buds i would recommend trying the food here at least once,4,
"we went to the first floor confused whether to go to shanghai chef or kobe is later to realise they are in the same restaurant ie they share floor space we decided to order chinese we had the dimsum platter 35 kung pao chicken 25 dragon prawns 25 and fried ice cream 45 the chicken was hard inside not indicative of fresh chicken the prawns were sweet and the dimsums had thick coatings i did not enjoy my time at shanghai chef so maybe when you are there just try the sizzler ill update my review when i have it
kobe is is a really famous chain for sizzlers",2,
they have a wide range of food offering nothing much to talk about ambiance i visited this place 2 times in a week 1st time ordered a sizzler which was fantastic  2nd time we had a chicken stater soup and a american chopsuey soup and starter was good but sea food american chopsuey was not good being a person from coastal area i can tell if sea food is fresh or not and boy the prawns were not fresh that is for sure all and all its a causal dinning if you crave for some variety of asian food,4,
stale food and indigestible noodles please do not visit here if you do not want to fall sick the chicken was dry and uncooked  the noodles was sticky and under cooked felt the items were reheated as it was served way quicker than expected,1,
"shanghai chef 2
located in the gachibowli hyderabad 
food they are serve is looking good and so tasty
price is reasonable
staff service is best",5,
"location wise it is placed in a prime location centre of it area gachibowli food was so delicious only if you like chinese flavor else do not visit interior ambience was not so cool very ordinary different kind of soups and dimsums are available at reasonable prices
great place to hangout but if you are planning to visit in weekend then prebooking is recommended",3,
really loved the foodtried new chinese thingswould definitely recommend thisthe service was a little slowbut the taste compensated for ita must visit if you love typical chinese food,4,
extremely poor food quality i have got my food order replaced everytime i have come here the service is also not friendly this is my last visit to this place i am sorry for the negative reviews but this time it was unbearable,1,
quantity is very less and not so tasty  but service is good if it provide quantity with tasty food will help the restaurant to attract customers,1,
its a casual place for good chinese food the ambience is a bit dull but the food is okay service is ok have been here on multiple occasions and have liked the food they serve,3,
it is a duo restaurant where you can have chinese and sizzlers together available at one place  well quantity is much less compared to price and taste is not that good though as chinese should be at that price,3,
shanghai chef and koba sezler both are same restaurents but dont know why in zomato it ia showing as different you can try this restaurent with friends to taste different chinese varities,4,
small little chinese joint good courteous staff and tasty food low on your pocket as well located in gachibowli used zomato gold which was absolutely value for money here,3,
i have ordered food online veg chilly garlic noodles and honey chilly potato the taste was pathetic in chilli garlic noodles there was no garlic and honey potato noodles they have made french fries and put a sweet syrup on it looks like chief does not know how to cook this dish,1,
i have been to shanghai chef 2 quite a few times now twice before kobe sizzlers moved in and once after it has great staff and a wonderful ambience it gets busy over the weekend and you might have to reserve a table beforehand their sizzlers are wonderful and they have a great set of starters i would suggest you try them over the main course,4,
service was pathetic and staff was absolutely rude and not open for feedback service is one area where management has to focus on at least as per my experience definitely not a place that i will ever visit again with the kind of experience not that there was any argument or anything it was very cold,1,
"liked the food thanks for suggesting khaophatkraphao it was good as a full serving

missed the fried ice cream definitely gonna come back for it

sorry not to corporate on billing 

giveatry",4,
this place is amazing the food is really tasty especially the chef recommended the owner suhail is very courteous and professional he suggested some great stuff to try and customised the food as per our requirements,5,
shanghai chef has always been the place to go for chinese fast food they have a good choice of menu and the food is great i highly recommend having the crab fried rice and the diced chicken in oriental sauce america is chopsuey is equally tasty,4,
"this is one go to place for us for authentic chinese food and it does always stand by my expectation

we have visited it in past and have always loved the food

this time we tried some nice salt and pepper vegetable starter which was okishas i found it to be a little bland that is why there is one less star

we tried veg manchow soup which was amazing

khao soi was the main dish we ordered and was again bang on

ambiance is pretty much simple yet nice

food is amazing service is good

it is definitely worth the money we pay",4,
"ambiance
shanghai chef has one of it is outlet in gachibowli shanghai chef is chinese theme restaurant specialised in their chinese dishes it has indoor sitting available with beautiful lights and music in the background sitting arrangement includes couch and chairs
food
we placed an order for sesame chilli chicken as it was mentioned as must try starter in the menu sesame chilli contained a large amount of chilli chicken topped with sesame seeds and served with salad which tasted somewhat sweet sesame chilli chicken cost approximately inr 280 we also placed an order for khao phad kruptao in rice item which included fried rice topped with spicy gravy contained spinach and capsicum cost approximately inr 290 shanghai chef 2 offers 11 dish on zomato gold membership

service was very quick and the staff was very polite",3,
it is a small place with nice ambience and comfortable sitting the service was quick and people were friendly the noodles we ordered were okay and the veg kung pao was good it is a nice place for a casual hangout and chinese food,4,
"lovely place to have chinese food excellent service and the place is very pleasant to sit with dear ones
quality of the dishes are too good",5,
"ordered chicken fried rice and kung phu chicken the food was great and value for money quantity is less good ambience

quantity 35
taste 455
ambience 455",4,
restaurant serves stored food today i visited to have fried ice cream but it is not fresh they prepared the food long back and just kept it refrigerated it is not fresh when i asked for any manager in the place there is no manager available worst experience ever i would not prefer it to anyone,1,
a small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table at first we thought it is a good budget friendly restaurant for chinese food in gachibowli food tasted good and so was the presentation we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with waiter over something and to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare they should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen,2,
it is a good restaurant for chinese food in gachibowliwe did order food and starters from here and loved the quality and quantity the staff were all friendly n ambience was decent only problem was that their card swipe machine was not workingbut overall a good experience in hyderabad n will visit again to have chinese food in the landof biriyani,4,
a very cosy outlet for some delicious chinese indulgence in the city of hyderabad the place is ideal for fulfilling the cravings for delicious chinese food,5,
"food was not that not at all good  just not able to have the name that they have got 
i have ordered 2 items and was thinking to have more but by seeing the tase and planes to shift other place 
i have ordered chicken fried rice and i see chicken was not that well cooked and i can see chicken skin been used as that same have complained to management and they told me they use skin less chicken and they this might be a miss and told will change the order and they have replace it and again i got the new one but i was again i was disappointed to see the same mistake ",2,
"worst chinese i have ever eaten  the chopsuey was sweet and the paneer was bland ",1,
the portions were quite good also the dumplings were pretty impressive though the wait time was a bit too long but overall we had a good time,4,
"the overall rating present for this restaurant does not justice the experience will come to this in a bit

so a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on to give romantic dinner table feel and apt audible english chartbusters could not go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this
with this as a beginning shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen not aware of all the must try dishes of their own menu  most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers like an example since its not a fine dining we can not expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired this was the case when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate
on the food side crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple timesalso service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled

so coming back to first line the rating is probably for food only go at your own risk if your are looking for experience ",2,
we found cockroach in the food unhygienic pace dirty kitchen horrible staff and worst manager please think twice before you order food from here,1,
not a great place it has ok ambience and good hospitality but the food is not great i have tried america chicken chopsuey it is different from other chopsuey is out there and it is just average i have tried the tei pei chicken starter and it was not great the starter was not skinless and also the chicken was very chewy making it difficult to swallow i have heard that momo is over here are good but i did not want to try overall i was not satisfied,2,
i love thai red curry here awesome chinese food so many options to try different foods ambience is good and staff is very friendly and recommend different varaities,5,
nice ambience courteous staff best place to have good chinese menu starters was very good and the main course has good quantity and quality order will take some time to come,4,
i love this place for the soup  tom kha gai gung ask for chicken flavour of this soup that is a must try nice ambiance too and they served it lovely,5,
we came here to enjoy some good chinese food but instead were served with cockroach in american chopsuey we immediately showed that to the waiter and asked for the bill they deduced that dish from the bill but again will not dare to go to that place again was very disappointed,1,
exiting food great service definitely pooking forward to visiting again one suggestion though be available on all the food ordering apps you are not,5,
"i have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core
ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up it was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it ps we are a family who loves spicy food also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate highly dissapointed with food",1,
it is our default choice when we crave chinese food and if we are around the gachibowli area the food tastes great and the fact that they are open all the way from lunch to dinner makes is a very viable option for a decent lunch at odd times in the evening when most other places are closed till dinner the ambience has nothing to be complained about and the pricing is pretty decent,4,
"this place has lost its charm
went for dinner today ordered honey crispy chicken and butter garlic prawns
they served honey crispy chicken was waiting for butter garlic prawns after 40 minutes the person comes and asks for main course order i asked for butter garlic prawns he comes back after 5 minutes and says it is not available
pathetic service they take almost an hour to tell you if a order is available or not better avoid it if these are the standards of this place wasting customers time",1,
hi this is a restraunt where even if the customer says the dish is bland and not tasty chef comes back and say it is the way that it gets cooked no words more than that,1,
ordered sesame chilly chicken for home delivery and it was one of the worst chicken dishes i have had chicken was like rubber and they had added so much spices that it was almost bitter they did not even have the sense to send a spoon or fork and some tissues,1,
ordered salt and pepper prawns  it was extrememly salty and we couldnt eat it,1,
i ordered with them yesturday and got chicken in my veg pad thai  very disappointed with it as xhilli potato was really nice i dont recommend anyway who is vegetarian as i could not even reach them on phone,1,
ordered veg fried rice was so bland and tasteless for the price it smelled weird too i somehow felt street food would have been much better and cost effective,1,
decent ambience not the perfect place if you are looking for authentic oriental cuisine american chopsuey was reasonably good and the non veg platter was value for money well quantity atleast,3,
the place was nice the food was tasty the ambience was not bad either some of the stuff in the menu card was not there but overall it was a nice experience,4,
"i had high expectations of this restaurant but was dissapointed i sometimes ponder to visit them again because as per user reviews they are good

the seating is well the air conditioning is not its either chilly or completely stopped you cant help it

the servers are less and even being a small place you have to shout to catch their attention

the food oh god i dont know what happened with the chef that day but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities they were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter

so many wrongs bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was i unfortunate to visit them on their bad day they also need a experienced manager

ambience  2
food 2
service  0
value for money  1",1,
"two stars explained one for bearable ambience and another for bearable food this is not a authentic chinese restaurant not to be hateful but this place is just a fast food restaurant with better ambience

if you want an authentic chinese meal  do not come here",2,
"the only good thing about this place was friendly staff
rest assured was average
not so crowded either
chopsey tasted like honey not up to the mark
it was chinese  it had to be a little spicy but a dissapointment
soup and starters were okay
also they switched off the ac even when it wasnt late need to improve",2,
i went to this place yesterday and we used zomato gold the service was very disappointing restaurant was out of staff did not attend properly even when the place was not at all crowded food was also not upto the mark served after a long timeheard alot about this place but,1,
"went to this place which a bunch of foodies for a review session and to my delight it turned out to be an awesome experience
i always wanted to visit authentic chineese restaurants and this was the one
the service was very good along with a perfect ambience
lets begin with the food part
we started with a couple of soups tom kha gai which was a coconut milk based chicken soup and it was very yummy as you can feel the coconut flavour followed by lemon corriander soup which was also good
amongst the starters we tried tei pei chickenkung pao chicken phuket fish this was one of the best as the fish was perfectly fried and it was also crispy drawn prawns nice crispy which nice sausage
now the best part was the shu mai the dumplings were great and delicious it was my first time though but i found it really great
in the main course we had phad thai phakspicy flavored rice with nice flavours and the aroma was too temptingburmese khow suey which were steamed noodles with several addons like peanuts fried onions etc a must try one if you visit this place
we also had some mocktails my personal favorite was fall in love along with a couple of other like fruit punch 
the last but not the least the desert part we had fried icecreams which had coconut base and it was very yummy 
a nice place to visit if you are looking for some authentic chineese dishes",5,
"recently i went to this place for a review session with bunch of freaks this place is located at indiranagar
service was really great 

when it come to chineese cuisine  i thought to order few authentic dishes 

firstly they served us with soup  chicken manchow soup and tom kha gaigung which is coconut based people who likes coconut based cuisine then they must try this
coming to starters we ordered tai pai chicken dragon prawns kung pao phuket fish dumplings named shu mai out of these best was phuket fish which was crispy frm outside 

main course they served us burmese know suey  again this is coconut based dish where the gravy is made out of coconut  it is served with plain noodles  add ons like peanuts fried onions  green chillies variety of suaces 
pad thai rice which was just like fried rice 

they also serve mocktails and desert
fried ice cream was the best",5,
"i had visited few among many chinese places in past recently got a chance to visit shaghai chef located at prime location indra nagar welcomed nicely by the staff members

i did not thought much about food in starting as people do not eat chinese daily and i am weak in remembering chinese dishes name i had one thing in my mind shezwan p but as soon as the dinner started i was surprised there is more to it started with tom kha gaigung  chicken soup coconut based soup creamy and smooth with spices and topped with red chilli one word fantabulous then the marathon started one after another i was enjoying every bite had few expression changes in between but at end the conclusion  amazing dinner

strated with starter tai pai chicken dragon prawns pakoda kind tossed to give a spicy flavour i am not a fan of prawns so can not say kung puo chicken was decent phuket fish basha fish kind of crispy from outside soft inside tasted amazing and the dumplings named shu mai open dumplings with minced chicken it is not spices but is simply wow go for it tried few mocktails was ok but need some improvement other than that everything was good and then the deserts ice cream on brownie and fried ice cream were something hatke must try

in main course we had burmese khow suey noodles mixed with coconut kind gravy not spicy with stuffs to add on liked fried peanut fried onions chillis diff sauces etc and phad thai rice both were also good overall had a good time and dinner the staff members made our food tasting visit more comfortable recommended for good dine in one can go with dishes with must try tag if unable to decide and can consult staff members for know about the dishes",4,
"this restaurant have got a very peaceful atmosphere so been to this place for dinner with friendswe ordered soups 1st were my favourite was toma gaigung which is a rich coconut milk based prawns thai soupwe can taste the thick coconut milk taste and being a malayalee i always love the coconut taste and i just loved this oneit is a mild soup which give a small sweetness of coconut milkother two soups we ordered were manchow soup and chicken lemon coriander soupmanchow soup dint taste like how it is suppose to bewe ordered the chicken one so it was a spicy soup with a chilly and garlic combo and coming to the chicken lemon coriander soupit had a strong taste of lemon with minced chicken and vegetables and i dint like that much but my friend who ordered this soup loved this

now coming to the starterswe ordered dragon prawnstei pei chickenkung puo chickenshu mai dumplingsphuket fishwe were served with dragon prawns first which was crispy added into a sauce and garnished with cashew nuts kinda dish which is spicytei pei dish was a starter which i loved than the dragon prawns onewhich is mildy sweet one and not too spicy like dragon prawnsso the last starter we tried was phuket fish which was cooked well and it was fried kinda hard and added to soya sauce and tasted awesomecoming to djmoljngs we had shu mai dumplings which are steamed and half opened dumplings which was tasting too good with the chilly sauce

we ordered mocktails after the starter and we had fall in love which i really loved which had a mixed taste of both litchi and strawberrylitchi punch which i ordered which does not give the colour of litchi and dint give too much of litchi tastealfonza which is of mango and tasted great and also fruit punch which was a mixed fruit mocktailthey have mentioned mocktail with scoop of ice cream so i dint find a scoop in it or do not know whether they mix it with the juice and serve but all were tasting great

now coming to the main course we had burmese khow suey and phad thai phakwe had the burmese dish which was ma favourite again as it is made of rich coconut milk and noodles one and too yummy for your tummy dishthis dish was served with other set of seasonings and condiments so people do try this one and you will love this and this is creamy nonspicy dishphad thai phak which was of rice type garnished with an egg omelette which is like a fried rice dish and a spicy one

last we had fried ice cream and brownie with icecream as dessertsboth were yummy where brownie ice cream was served with butterscotch ice cream flavour with a strawberry sauce as the topping and fried icecream coating is made of coconut so do try these",4,
"not recommended  food is not tasty better change yiur chef2  call chef1
food quality is bad n taste is worst n got cold not at all acceptable",1,
i am frequent here like their noodles varieties almost tried every non veg noodles and rice items i like it if not love it i do not mind ambience here coz i love chinese but ambience is okay service is good price is affordable prawns dishes are very pleasing either with rice or noodles,4,
"i ordered the pad thai noodles all the veggies were under cooked and raw and the noodles were over cooked there was no chewiness in the noodles completely tasteless
extremely disappointing experience today as i have already ordered the same item earlier also and it used to be good before",1,
i loved the food authentic chinese and nice ambience taste was really good had rice noodles after a long time and it was pretty good the lamb and dragon prawns are must try,5,
"loved the food very cute ambience service was the downside though despite the crowd being normal and not heavy none of the waiters were in sight when we needed them

that being said i recommend the wontons the manchow soup and the chilly paneer fried rice was a little insipid but other than that a definite recommendation",4,
"thier platters might sound a bit confusing since they are more like normal starters but definitely taste good
a must try item on their menu is bamboo rice it has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours i absolutely loved it
do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu i did not find anything very special in it its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and i was expecting a little moderations there",3,
pocket friendly quick service and quiet ambience makes this place a must visit for its chinese chopsey mee goreng and nasi goreng nenus serves fresh and good quantity for its price,4,
"food is amazingly delicious  its pocket friendly too
nice simple ambiance  staffs are well mannered even one can go with their suggestion in the menu
most of food items i tasted veg  non veg both  its up to the mark",5,
awesome awesome awesome,5,
"nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service
the restuarant is located on first floor having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors appropriately giving a glimpse of typical chinese restaurant not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too  i hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor 45

the crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us after exchanging a few words he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab 
owner and staff courtesy 55

we first ordered talumein soup355moderately spicy and filled with veggies which is certainly a healthy start

we ordered mee gorang noodles 355  comprised of lots of green and red chillies a perfect form of noodles to relish 
recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles

noodles accompanied with 8 hot pot garlic gravy35 which went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of french beans that hindered the potential of dish",3,
"food was okay we ordered two chicken dishes for starters and it had too much sauce in it noodles were good monis were really good though would try again rest was okay would try again if no options are available ",3,
"ok place the food was just fine but since it is reasonably priced its decent value for money
service is ordinary though
on a sunday afternoon the place was empty and it was hard to digest i almost went out but then decided to give it a try anyway
bottom line if i want to eat relatively inexpensive chinese food then this might be a choice else no",3,
"one of my favourite chinese restaurant in hyderabad

good and authenticate chinese restaurant the ambiance was decent nothing fancy just a sober place to enjoy food

food  455
service  45
ambience  35",4,
nice place for chinese lovers decent music nice ambience food is really very tasty we visit almost every time we have a chinese craving,5,
very high priced low quality food,1,
"delivered on time
",5,
the quantity of soup was half of what they provide at the restaurant,3,
food was good but please send some forks tissues and sauce packets from next time,3,
good food nice ambience friendly staff order time is more platters are good desserts and mocktails are overpriced for their quality and quantity,5,
"what a scrumptious dinner at shanghai chef 2

after a long day at chilkur balaji we we are so hungry that we just wanted to checkin to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter however good food was also a priority to us also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene

the first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chefwe did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant

the restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor comfortable seating and dim lighting so neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail bhai told us that it is a 10 years old restaurant and his first one

aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel he suggested us all the dishes throughout

we started off with tom kha ghai soup  actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired the garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we are so refreshing

we then ordered nasi goreng chiken long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it must try and bar b q chiken  this was perfect combination with the rice lil sweet spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wetmust try

mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too

burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too 

for take away we ordered phad thai mix sea food noodlesand trust me after having so much at restaurant i could not resist when rawshan opened the box at home i went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it oh my god this is one amazing dish that i have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity one take away of this is sufficient for three people

flat noodles cooked with garlic fresh herbs prawns and fish with mushroom and sweet sauce also fresh red chilli  a must must try 

quantity of food served here is unbelievable

for the taste and quantity and quality the vfm factor is best in the town

bill came to 1600 for 4 after 10 friendly gesture discount

staff is very friendly and aditya was great at service

we were about to leave suhail suhrac macadams bumped into us it was great meeting you and thanks for making our dinner so special",5,
"an awesome place to enjoy chinese it looks very ordinary from the outside but the interior of the restaurant is very classy the ambience is really very good the most amazing and surprising part of this restaurant is it is food i was so amazed with the food it is a 100 must go place for all foodies the prices matches the quantityquality and does not leave a hole in your pocket this sets the restaurant miles apart in comparison to other similar level chinese restaurant
this restaurant will definitely be one of my top favourites while considering chinese",5,
"the gravy were very dilute
every time we order it is thick
this time i ordered more quantity and received it thinner i actually paid more for less",1,
"so tasty yummy ",5,
nasi goreng kung pao chicken  burnt garlic chicken were really spicy  over powered with chilly flakes looked  tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it the saving grace was the indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice really upset with tonight is order,1,
food was worst and it came with a strong smell of oil chilly garlic noodle did not have any garlic not even the flavour all the items were really not eatable,1,
good place for chinese cuisine lover we ordered chiken manchurian and singapore fried rice the fried rice was ok oktasted average chiken manchurian was lil spicy but liked it good for one time visit,4,
not exactly the best place for value for money and food is not exactly the best eithermeat is chewy and badly cookedambience is a good thumbs up however,3,
very salty,3,
it was a ok ok,3,
"food and service was good
i ordered lemon coriander souphoney chilli potato and schezwan noodles
soup was just okay
honey chilli potato was tasty but could have been more crispy
schezwan noodles were tasty
overall good experience",4,
was very salty,3,
got a piece of mirror in the food,1,
worth,5,
chilli paneer was bad paneer was stale rest all fine,2,
we ordered sea food bamboo rice and it tasted worse rotten smell from the rice made me sick ordered kung pao chicken we asked for something spicy and they suggested kung pao chicken but it is sweet  i never knew that something sweet is actually meant to be spicy at shanghai chef we also ordered black pepper chicken curry and manchow soup these two were ok,1,
good authentic chinese,4,
"saturday is lunch from shanghai chef 2 did not go bad
i ordered chicken chilli garlic rice and oyster chicken

the rice was perfectly cooked with the ingredients giving out their individual flavors
the chicken soft and juicy was a great delight
the quantity of food provided was definitely more than enough for 2 people with below average appetite

would certainly recommend to try out this place",4,
this place has not failed to delight us of the multiple times that my friends family and i have dined there not one has been disappointing the food is fresh tasty and also visually appealing the staff is friendly and the service is prompt the restaurant is clean and maintained i recommend this place for good value chinese food,4,
teriyaki chicken quantity was very little kung pao vegetables have no veggies in it just full of sauce,1,
it is good,4,
the food offered has its standard tastes good  offers good amount at good price,5,
first of all just love the ambience and food was absolutely goodspecially the crab meat soupjust wowonly the thing is thai raosted chiken is filled with a heavy coconut cream otherwise its good,5,
i had pretty authentic chinese food here along with chilli sauce and chicken pieces in noodles they served few insects as well staff is also quite cool and composed even after showing it to them he just walked away with the bowl and did not even bothered to say sorry respect,1,
"ok ok food is not that tastey  i will not recommend this place for eating
place is not so clean  the kitchen counter is not good cost is more",2,
good south indian breakfast items  u can try all the south indian items like idly and diffrnt kinds of dosas  also u can try out various chutneys,4,
this place serve best south indian food with awesome taste  i had iddli there and it is very floppy and taste is nice  it is better to pack food and eat at home  if you are alone or with friends then you can eat here  it is always crowed,4,
"very good place to breakfast yes the sitting area a problematic even to stand also its bit cramp as this place is always crowded for its best food

sometimes my day starts with a lip licking breakfast from here
",4,
the food they prepare is very good than other udipi hotels the way they do parcel and the care they take for taste is good good food at good price,5,
ambience is okay but the food is good regular idly sambar idly poori mysore bonda dosa are good sambar chutney are good in taste a definite place to try the food,4,
if it had not been for my friend this place would have simple gone unnoticed your typical road side eatery and must have breakfast destinations the pipping hot vadas are the best i have had restricted myself to just one vada so that i could try other items butter steamed dosa and karampudi idli were good too visited this place on both the days for breakfast during my 2day visit to hyderabad,5,
"not up to mark as per it is brand name


food is just like ordinary tiffin centre is

need to improve and provide food really authentic of udipi
ambiance is really awkward no cleanliness even in ac family section also",2,
"a regular tiffin place in gachibowli their idlis mysore bondas and vadas are all wonderful
the sambat idlis are great too

 super fast delivery",5,
"foodfor friends in regards with taste it is too good but if you want to order something you need to be aware of packing
packing is not good i ordered sambar idly and they didnt gave me spoon how can a person eat sambar idly with put spoon
need to maintain those things other than that food is too good
i will prefer to visit",3,
"one of the best places to have south indian tiffin varieties in gachibowli area  most cost effective and tasty quick fast food on offer i enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too  if anyone have any doubt the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here 

situated in a busy area on the gachibowli main road near to the orr interjunction you cannot miss the place i have tried out their meals tiffin varieties the bhajji  pakodas in the evening and also their tea have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints 

absolutely zero ambiance and its self service too be prepared for the rush and once you get the token be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside there is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random  when your food item is ready they spot you and give it to you be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem there are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat just eat your food quick and rush out 

my fav of theirs is the dosa i just loved the chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste also loved the kerala parotta which is a fav dish of mine back home here in chennai",4,
great place for a quick breakfast in indira nagar area dosas poori are good and the restaurant serve food faster hot beverages are available too,5,
whenever we are in gachibowli we definitely have our breakfast here the quality of food is really good and all the tiffins tastes amazing my favourite is vada,4,
when i first reached hyderabad i wanted to eat dosa and idli just like the ones i had in chennai so after some research i reached udupi is upahar the sambar was sweeter than i expected i believe it is the karnataka style i still liked it the bonda was awesome and the price was comparatively low great experience i would like it if they had spicier sambar,4,
no frills place many families frequent this restaurant there is air conditioned seating area below do not expect great service but the service will be quick prices reasonable pineapple kesari and parota kurma are must have,5,
"if you are looking for a good south indian breakfast then this place is a mustgo prices is rather higher than any usual shop but the quality would make worth spending that money

good variety good taste decent staff have options for chat teacoffee stall as well",4,
nice place for budget outing generally taste of all items is good and very reasonable regular place of visit of us when in hurry quick service good parcel option for quick takeaways south indian food is better here compared to north indian food juice and tea counter outside helps,4,
"used to be great for tasty breakfast now almost flat taste unless have other options no more a must have place

service standard  okay
pricing  okay
parking  unless peak hours  can find one",3,
good food loved the south indian dishes over here plus the ordering system is good but i feel they should have some more space it gets hoch poch when it is crowded overall nice experience,4,
i was here with my dad for a quick tiffin snack time on our way home frankly speaking i was not expecting such good food we had masala dosa idli and vada i felt there could have been a better variety of chutneys like tamarind or ginger apart from the regular coconut one not only did the food make us feel satiated but also satisfied,4,
i ordered so many times here food was really good and the sambar is good to have but chutney is not at all good and set dosa poori with kurma good to have all they have to do is to improve chutney packing 55,4,
it has the best rava idlis that you can get i usually visit this place early in the morning on weekends it is always crowded they have a seating area downstairs as well it is a place where you can have a quick bite and enjoy a cup of tea,4,
the best coconut chutney and sambhar in town pick any food item and its delicious you can say that by the crowd at their place to get anything must try idlisambhar poori bhaji butter pav bhaji,4,
"my go to place for all my south indian tiffin fixes in the city
their pesarratu set dosas and podi idli is to die for
ginger chai on the go is absolutely perfect for all kind of chai lovers",5,
whatever you order from there or eat their it is alway good  delicious their pineapple kesari bath is one of the best the way they server food on banana leaf is awesome  there are very few veg restaurants who serve food that way,5,
"the coconut chutney here is great
food is prepared with less oil
do try cheese dosa and bisibelle bath
also try ginger tea available at udipi tea stall
tea is very good in flavour",4,
rudest billing staff ever did not provide change worst customer service never going again do not know how to treat the customers many options available,1,
"this place is my default option for south indian breakfast located right on the gachibowlikothaguda road this place serves poha idli dosa uttapam poori sabzi etc personally i prefer their south indian food
there is a small juice counter outside the restaurant as well

if you are looking for ambience then this place is not a great option but taste wise and cost wise it will not disappoint you

happy eating ",4,
udipi is is perhaps one of the best budget friendly joints in the indiranagar area their ghee idly is a must try and so are their dosas if you are there for breakfast do try their poha,4,
"this is one of the place where you can find all the foods in a very reasonable price but it does not mean that you have to compromise with your taste buds i have tried veg manchurian gobi manuchurian idli sambhar vada sambhar dahi vada dosa  must try   puri and curry and poha i tried one unique combination here and that is plain dosa with veg manchurian and it was just yummm i would suggest you as well to try this ",4,

good food pocket friendly and healthy i have ordered few times for luch and i liked it if you have office nearby order food from this place,5,
very rude staff and bad service disapppinted decent foodgood harabhara kabab have been there multiple times i last never faced such bad service the manager was very rude disinterested and had no concern with any grievances the bill desk guy apologised on his behalf but the manager just chose to walk away,1,
good place to dine  south indian dishes are amazing and mouth watering  one can dine with family anytime who love pure vegetarian food and brunches rather than lunch,5,
very bad service 90 time you will keep on waiting for food even when i ordered thali thwy took more than half n hour to bring it even the food was nothing compare to rajdhani,1,
"tried this place after a long time the order was just a south indian thali peas pulav mixed subzi chatpata and a strawberry milkshake
arrived at the restaurant by 215 on a sunday afternoon after a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake will a restaurant serve side drink  dessert first when the main course is yet to be served

service 15  you will see waiters only while ordering the food once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water you will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy but no one will respond when you raise your hand or call for them i literally had ti walk to them and ask for water

ambiance 15 
some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
in short a worthless place

food quality and taste 15
coming to the quality of food  the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice
very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum
as mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins the south indian thali had a sambar  it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water when requested for a refill of bindi it was the only dish that was nice i was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time i seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve i have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level

value for money  055

for these so called high quality dishes i had to pay around 900 in short i will not suggest this place at all",1,
food is pricey and portion size is not justified serving is super slow tons tons of improvement required if i have a choice i would avoid this place,1,
good one you get a combination of south and north indian varieties in a single thali the servicing here is very slow i have been here twice and it took more than half an hour to get the starters staff are polite and friendly,4,
excellent food excellent service if you want to experience north indian cuisinethen this is the best place to be in the prices are also appropriate and the food quantity is good,5,
ambience was goodbut the service was toooo badno one will take care after you order the foodits really patheticwe need to ask for food repeatedly after 45 min they brought one starter and for main course they took one hour of timenever prefer this restaurant,1,
"i ordered today veg fried rice veg curry rumali roties and onion raita
but when it was delivered the onion raita was missing in the delivery for which i had paid 59 rs 
i am soo disappointed with this order discrprency",1,
"i found this place pathetic went yesterday most of the dishes we ordered were not available the excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave i wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available
i read on zomato reviews that their thali is good and restaurant is menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well but on reaching restaurant i found out they are not serving thali in dinner now i travelled 9km to visit this restaurant

food was pathetic as well tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida and the dishes were either too oily or just bad

overall this place is very bad and does not deserve a visit at all there are plenty of restaurants all around hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate

avoid this restaurant at all cost ",1,
i visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family this is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining but yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed it took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali i called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time but is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time after 40 minutes the food was served but the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out,1,
have been a regular customer but waa totally dissatisfied today had to wait for 10 mins even to be served water they are very short staffed and the manager is just not polite they need to really up their service will think to go back again,1,
quality and quantity is very less for biryani comboit is not worth of 150 rsas a team we ordered 18 plates which is not sufficientplease look into it,1,
good thali spread for ugadi the taste and overall experience was good service was slow for non thali orders and had to ask multiple times to refill dal and sambhar in the thali,4,
overrated restaurant with pathetic service and average food spent 25 hours just for starters and main course had 2 rounds of rotis before paneer sabzi arrived after asking manager that we have ordered main course more than half hour back he told that you have ordered only 5 mins back after this episode also it came after half an hour more visit the place if you have free time and want air condition nothing else you can expect,1,
one of the worst in and around gachibowli i ordered two rice combo and sent one and collected money for two such a non sense guy the mathura villas owner never believe in their words,1,
"we have ordered veg chilly sticks and golden baby corn
veg chilly sticks are good and must try golden fry baby corn and veg biryani are worst",3,
had been to this place for a lunch decent place  had a south indian thali food is okay  but can be a better in terms of taste decent ambience  service but something is a miss here,3,
"extremely disappointed with the service they delayed serving the food the staff is very lethargic and do not seem to care save your time go elsewhere by the by the pepper curry was the worst do not try searching for this in menu for this dish it is not there they added so much of pepper it felt like some chef is spontaneous idea which messed up our palate ",1,
"ours was not a good experience poor hospitali
ty slow service n bad temperament from the manager not likely to visit again disappointed   ",1,
staff is very reckless and they are least bother about the customer we left without having lunch for keeping wait for more then 30 mins and the manager even not ask us to wait he went inside to cancel the order,1,
"visited this afternoon pleasant ambience temple like feeling with a bell at the door and a idol at entrance ordered north indian thali taste was okay not an extraordinary thali though served butter rotis jeera rice and white rice5 curries dal payasam and kheer kheer was the highlight which i want to call out
ambience 35
food 35
service 45",3,
loved the collection and flavour of indian cuisines and homely food the staff are humble and will present food as per your customisation that is really good,5,
never order full meals online at the end you will get disappointed with incorrect items from the given menu expected alot by seeings reviews,2,
"for some reasons unknown to me i decided to try this place the thali on the other zomato reviews seemed worth a try i thought
i was told thali would take 15 min and i waited after 25 min of waiting when i started asking around they said thali is not available right now and will take another 20 min minimum i lost it no shame no options to offer what could be served quickly just a plain no i walked up they asked me to pay for a bottle of water which i consumed and left the manager did not even bother
went to over the moon next door and had a great exp folkd there told me this outliet of mv is in bad shape and likely to close soon
if you want to take a chance of really poor exp maybe no food maybe bad food",1,
"visited with family
overall decent ambience and decent veg food

if looking for a pure veg place with decent ambience then this could be your place",4,
"had been here on pongal to have veg lunch since my uncle and aunt were in hyderabad my aunt insisted on having laccha paratha there which when arrived was found to be regular butter roti and the staff even insisted on the same funda that it was laccha paratha this was a turn off for me but otherwise it is good veg restaurant to visit in gachibowli area
so here goes my rating

hope i will have a good exeperience tge next time i visit mathura vilas

p s i was able to use my zomato gold here on food",3,
"too good and place is very fine food is lovely and delicious hotel is nice
i have never seen like this desert is lovely and different from other place",5,
"very bed experience they have created problem in deduction for zomato gold multiple times
zomato should take action against this restaurant",1,
this restaurant has gone way below the acceptable quality levels had been a great place to go earlier but looks like they have started compromising in quality of food and service items on the menu are not available but offered what they had at that time rice was watery none to care for your concern but were commenting on what was wrong and it was eatable will never come here again,1,
"this place was a good veg eatery earlier with options of good thalibut the experience which we had today completely my opinion
food was cold service was very slow dirty tables and wares and ill maintained wash rooms and on top of it misleadin offer of 25 discount i just had my last visit today",1,
decent place for veg lovers tried south indian veg thali it was served with wide variety of items which were tasty quality of the items could be improved a bit,4,
south and north thalis are their go to options with good spread of varieties in them ambience is decent for dining with family only drawback is their slow service they typically take 2025 mins to get the thali you might not find it crowded but do not let that fool you it is a good place,4,
very busy place rude waitress thalis are very nice here but do not try any other varieties because they taste very bad i had very bad experience only vegetarian food,2,
this place is really hiding next to the gachibowli flyover this is undoubtedly the best north indian thali in hyderabad been there twice and never was disappointed the taste of all the items in the thali was amazing i hope they maintain that quality the ambiance is good and the staff is quite friendly who oblige you on your request for roti instead of puri the south indian thali needs a tad bit improvement best vegetarian thali in town food taste 4service 5ambience 4value for money 4,4,
"yesterday we have been to mathura vilas first time had ala kart oh my god too much expensive and not worth of against quantity we ordered
kaju masala which is 265 inclusive of all taxes he just gave in very small bowl and ordered butter naan which is again looting only like 70rs each butter naan inclusive of all taxes and coming to cool drink it is like ditched 70rs inclusive of all taxes they simply loot your purse and money",1,
"i have been my third time here
the food is quite good here but when it comes to service we need a lot of patiencei have experienced the same third timewe had to wait for quite long time for food and even the bill

food  35
ambience35
service15

need to improve in this factor",2,
"firstly the seating tables and chairs interiors all are awesome but the foooooood when compared with its pricing did not meet the minimum standards i could it is worst the butter naan is charged at a rs 60  huhh the worst naan i ever ate and service what a pity i should stand and call a person for service and totally this restaurant is worthless for the service and the pricing
the pricing is very premium and the taste  what a road side small dabas are very far better than this",1,
exceeded expectations to frame it simply simply loved the pure vegetarian food after a long time even being a nonvegetarian all the starters we ordered are awesome main course curries are good but not as good as starters ambience is good serving has to be bit fast,4,
average food have come across small amounts of mud in the food they take a lot of time to serve food the menu is also not that special given the name of the restaurant which belies it,2,
pure vegetarian will like this placereally liked chilli vegetable sticks thali and roti basked optionstaff is very nice and courteous,5,
ordered north indian thali tastes bad most of the curries are bad in taste except one which is panneer i had a feeling that chole curry was prepared yesterday and it smells  tasts bad they served 2 sweets semiya and kirayi only semiya tastes good,1,
very poor service people are very slow you have to wait for 15 minutes to get one item the funny part is even for giving bill they take ages as if they are not interested in taking money as well i will never recommend this place to anyone because of its poor service,1,
super place for vegans the food quantity is good enough quality is also great but the old boring musicambience is nice it is an efforable place for families,4,
serving was good taste also good more quantity of staters but it taste good for veg it is good option but they take more time get a dish nice place,4,
"this is a simple place to dine out casual sitting with apt lighting there thali and al karte both are equally good and but prices are on a little higher side specially breads

service is fine good for pure vegetarians",3,
"we had been to the restaurant for lunch and ordered of course the south indian thali it was served almost as shown in the pictures 

ambiance small  simple the background music on kanhaiyya was very soothing
service was ok no major issues
food food was good definitely not exceptional but worth trying the poori poori is sabzi pachadi sweet  curd are very tasty
price slightly expensive",3,
"food was good with right mix of spices we went in a group of 6 as soon as we entered they offered seats and welcomed us we had two kids with us they gave complimentary ice creams for them it helped us making kids busy while we decided on the menu menu had a good vegetarian variety we were looking for veg food we ordered north indian thali which was yummy it covered a good mix of curries

overall food is good just have to be a bit patient as i felt they were slow on service after ordering food it may be because it had a parallel birthday party going on and was a bit crowded",5,
i have been to this place for random dinner with friends and it was the most stupid decision the place is the perfect example of mismanagement the food was also pathetic we have ordered sambhar rice after a lot of disappointment thinking that atleast it will come on time and will be good in taste but i guess they were checking our patience and it took almost 2025mins for us to get that they were so slow even in providing bill and on top of that they have added service charge without even our notice i have given two stars only because the manager  owner not sure was really very courteous and he has asked not to pay by acknowledging our complaints,2,
"food  too salty and i did not understand how can someone go wrong with something as easy as bisebella bath
even the other items were very average and salty

staff  with only twenty percent occupancy the staff forgot the order and in general the service is lousy

ambience  its neat and satwik

i would recommend to give this restaurant a pass its not worth the time and money",1,
"had a great time in mathura vilas ambience is okayish staff was friendly but server presented all the starters and main course at one go which was little weird and by that time food was cold ",4,
"went to mathura vilas after long timewe ordered paneer tikka masala and dal makhaniboth items were very goodroti and naan were also good
overall 
1 food taste is good
2 service is slow
3 rotinaanparantha are on expensive side",4,
"combo veg thali worth to buy it excellent taste 
you can feel taste of each and every food item i am that thali 
at end basmati rice has super aroma ",5,
went here for lunch with family members ordered south indian thali which is way more better than chutneys ambiance was okay service can be improved as we have to ask more than once to refill few items overall a good experience,3,
"food its an awesome place we visit once in 2 months with family covering a large distance due to taste of various items in its north  south thali one could order more of any item of their like from the thali as its not limited

service sometime is slow restaurant not ready for more customers or waiters lie on face that item is over and still serve to other customers before us then chef comes to rescue the chef is courteous as takes feedback and works on it

over nice place for quality food not everything is 100 hence 4 star rating",4,
i wants to try some veg cuisines so found this place on zomato i ordered tandoori mushroom and veg soft noodles both the dishes was good and tasty both the dishes were prepared in very less oil ambiance was also good,4,
bad service and the attitude of the staff is bad as well the food was good both in terms of taste and quality had they been good service would have been good experience,3,
"mathura vilas restaurant is a really great
we are thali also south or north is a great
and ambiance was good
service staff wehaver an attitude was fine
i am visit again",5,
worst service food those who want blood pressure problem may visit every thing highly saalted do not go on name mathura it is local worst food worst service,1,
ordered malai kofta very sweet n has a peculiar after taste the butter naan was chewy only the tandoori roti was good the only think i liked,3,
we ordered veg thali here and trust me on this food taste was good perhaps they can do better on buttermilk area serve in medium or large glass guys we did not order tequila shots average price levels place to be with your office colleagues sometimes for quick feast,4,
"service  extremely poor 1
food  average 2
ambience average 2
overall not a good experience we ordered for north indian thali had to wait pretty long for it to come finally arrived now to make it worse if we ordered for some more they took 20 mins or more to get the item they are so slow in serving you will loose interest in your food welcome drink came after we finished having the starters such is their promptness",2,
what is the point of taking zomato gold when there are so many restrictions on what is eligible look at the terms and conditions  they are so restrictive the main speciality of the mathura vilas ie thali is not eligible for zomato gold coverage of zomato gold needs to drastically improve no point in having zomato gold otherwise,1,
"apparently on holidayshalf their staff too goes on a holiday
the service was horrible took them 10 minutes to clean our table and another 10 minutes to serve us water
if this was not frustrating enough they took 30 minutes more to get us undercooked food and some of the dishes in the thali were cold",1,
"mathura vilasthe food really justifies the name

food 

the typical vegetarian restaurant serves pretty good thalis these unlimited thalis are served at lunch and dinner there are wide variety of curries both in the south indian and north indian thalis they should have included puri is in the north indian thali as well the expectation is reached as they served this food in a banana leaf

ambience 

the ambience of the restaurant is good can not say great but it is good

service 

the service was extremely good they staff were very prompt and attentive the wait time for the food is less

on the whole a must visit restaurant for a hungry vegetarian",4,
pathetic place we had ordered for non spicy food but what they served us was tasteless spicy food also when we wanted to order for dessert they said everything in the dessert menu got over by lunch and hence there is nothing left for dinner,1,
"went there  around 1045pm was really hungry
had heard a lot about this place

food was not good at all roti is tandoori could easily be confused with papad both were so thin and cold

sabzi was cold and seems like they did not care about customer

even at that time when we were the only table operating there was so much delay for someone to attend our table

not visiting this place ever again",1,
i quite like the sumptuous north indian and south indian vegetarian thalis at this place served hot reasonably priced not too fond of ala carte here though i must add it is still better than a lot of places the ambience and simple aesthetics of the place make it a great place for sunday lunch with family,3,
north indian thali was okay we ordered paneer butter masala categorically saying do not use onion and garlic the concern person said he will serve however they still used both the ingredients,2,
dont get fooled by seeing their advertisements where they show lavish south indian thali served on banana leaf we went there in search of authentic south cusine but returned disappointed they did not have any kind of thali at dinner and serve only north indian ala carte we ordered some soup and starters which was okay then we ordered besibelebhat and curd rice both were patheticthey have a very confused theme do not waste your time or spoil your mood,1,
absolutely delicious food telugu lo cheppalante  kammaga undi after several years i have found a south indian thali in hyderabad that is a perfect blend of taste and spices surprisingly every dish is tasty it is very rare that restaurants dare to include karelabitter gourd in their thali i should admire the expertise of the chef who included this fry by mixing it with podi the brinjal curry bagaira baingan is exceptional i should mention the choice of the tender and tiny brinjals used in this curry aloo bajji pulihare anna paravannampongal puri papad tomato curry with hot white rice made me get sleep right after the lunch i give 5 out of 5 to the awesome chefs who can be an example to other restaurants by keeping a simple menu and still impress the food lovers even without lot of spicesgheeoil,5,
"worst service and behaviour
we ordered schezwan noodles we were served spoiled ones from the morning it smelled stale sticky to touch and yak in taste worst experience asked the waiter to taste a spoon so that he will come to know the pathetic taste he tasted and took away calmly 
though i just had one spoon of it and returned back still they charged for it
we spoke to the short fat manager for the charge levied on the spoiled food served which we did not even have he spoke very carelessly and extremely rudely
will never ever visit this again
strongly not recommended",1,
"had navratri thali here which was very tasty had a very basic taste and was totally abiding to the food eaten in fasting
place is nice and small tends to become a little congested sometimes
the only drawback is that this place is a little overpriced navratri thaali was for rs 300 and other items are also a little expensive",4,
i ordered veg thaliwhich was just nt up to the mark the fud seemed stale with out any taste we just threw it i will not recommend it to anyone,1,
"everything a veg foodie crave for though i am not vegetarian form delicious food to amazing mathura lassi though we ordered alacarte and enjoyed every dish gracefully seeing the thali at a nearby table looked even more tempting i do not much remember what we ordered as there were lots of dishes but every dish was a great experience and do not forget to order lassi service was also great

musthave lassi
ambiance quite good
service polite and quick

i will be visiting there to have thali next time",5,
"this was our first visit to mathura villas we had visited this place on the last day of navratri for dinner they only had special navratri thali in their menu for thali so we decided to go with it we were utterly disappointed with the food
1 the thali was filled with sambar green chutney and sweet chutney 1 peas corn gravy 1 alloo gravy mixture navratan kurma and dry banana veggie sour curd samudana vada samudana khichadi payasam fruit salad

2 there was no dal no kadi or any orther sabjigravy in the thali except for the kurma and cornpeas sabji nothing was appetizing enough

3 welcome drink like chaasjaljeera which is usually a part of any thali in india was not served on asking the manager he tells us that chaas is a part of the thali but that they missed swrving us

4 only fruit salad and payasam was given to us in the thali again we had to ask the waiters if they had served all that was a part of the thali only after enquiring abt the items did they mention that there is yet another sweet which they forgot to include

5 they only had plain rice for the thali

overall there was absolutely nothing special about the socalled special navratri thali ",2,
"disappointed with their so called special navaratri thali festival  they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali they told that they have only special navaratri thali we decided to order two of them
nothing special in this one by navaratri thali you would expect kadhi khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali utappam sambar payasam kela sabji mixture from south and tandoor roti puri corn n peas sabji tikki from north and small mixed fruits salad green chutney sweet chutney plain curd they had just plain steam rice 

they missed serving us welcome drink of chaaslassi

overall disappointed for the price paid and options received",3,
"fine place good food
bit overpriced to the quality they serve but that seems ok
hospitable staff atleast hygienic dining area and good food that is the take away",3,
nice placegood ambiancesuper friendly and helpful staff nilok das is the best staff among allhe will understand your needs and suggest food accordingly,5,
visitied last sunday for dinner order badami paneer and tandoori mushroom both were superb first time tried tandoori item of mushroom and it turns so delicious must try also they provide banana lassi as a compliment drink,4,
"we visited this place many times not so crowded
good ambience their thalis are good and a value for money
their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the priceesp platters and other starters
their service is very slow and you need to be patient
i would rate this restaurant 35",3,
"visited for some navratri special thali
taste was good but can be better can be made more interesting with suprise and authentic  cuisine is",3,
"enjoyed a lovely lunch with a friend first time visited the place good food ambience is very nice and a very curtious staff
tried the indian and chinese items for starters and main course must visit for a good vegetarian meal prices are also pretty reasonable overall 5 star rating for this place",5,
"this is the best veg restaurant in terms of food neatness and service at gachibowli region people are very polite while taking orders or serving loved it ",5,
"i am a pure non vegetarian but this place became an exception after i first went there they serve fresh hygienic tasty and flavourful food they also serve warm ghee with each meal unlimited

you should try this place it will change your perceptions on veg food",5,
"awesome foodgood for veg food loversthey serve both thali and ala carte food

we ordered manchow soup  tomato soup  tandoori mushrooms and tandoori aloo in starters

mushrooms i must say was spicy but too good almost melted in mouth aloo was also good

ambiance was ok okservice can be improved

overall very good restaurant for vegetarians",4,
"very happy with service provided by nilak das happy go lucky person
will visit just for his service and awsam food served by him i am happy with all",5,
decent place with good ambience a bit overpriced and service is a little slowquality of food is good and the staff is well spoken a decent family restraunt,4,
"mathura vilas is renowned for it is specialities but this time we tried to offer chinese food at the restaurant we ordered a veg noodles and manchurian with gravy
the taste came out to be just fine i was not very happy with the manchurian which lacked in veggies",3,
good place for family good service especially by nilak dasps nice foodin prime location and very friendly staff nice ambience with parking space,4,
great food very hygienic and clean recommended for vegetarians i will suggest you try the tandoori mushroom thank you bhagirathi jena and team for the awesome service,5,
the cost of the food was 200 but the quantity of rice packed was more but the gravies very less for a mealthe paneer gravy was missing curd very sourdefiniltely not worth for the money,2,
"went here for dinner with family to try their notorious south indian thali only to know that it is served only in the afternoon lunch greatly disappointed and order north indian thali as there is no other go and one corn fried rice
to our delight north indian thali was awesome enjoyed every dish present in it roti channa curry paneer bhendi and a gobi starter each one of it delicious unable to finish the whole quantity as we were full with more curries sweet was very different and scrumptious
corn fried rice was equally palatable and went well with curries that came in thali
definitely try this pure veg restaurant when you want a break from all those spicy and masala non veg dishes
it was deserted on the day we have been here not sure of the reason for less crowd ambiance is also great service is reasonable and price is also affordable when compared other restaurants",4,
"it was ganesh chaturthi and we decided to try something veg special  having heard so many good reviews about this place  i insisted on going here

with a pretty decent ambience  this place is very easy to locate  the staff is courteous we order the special thali which they were serving that day it was a combination of both north indian and south indian thalis  believe me the quantity is so much and it is unlimited

there were around 45 curries out of which there was paneer potato  cauliflower and 2 more  there were 23 sweet dishes including kurbani ka meetha there was daal sambar curd and papad all these were served with rice and poori and lachha paratha there was also buttermilk as a complimentary drink

the cost of the thali was 300 plus taxes so it costed around 330 per thali

for all those non vegetarian buffs like me  u will love this place if you like to experiment with vegetarian options too sometimes  and my vegetarian friends u will love this place so just get going and have a foodilicious experience",4,
bad experience first they denied zomato gold benefits by stating today is 15th aug so no offers to be honest food was even more bad paneer gravy was so watery n tasteless not recommended at all,1,
"great ambience
good service
good food
next visit for sure to try other varieties
sweet we had ordered was good and rotis and sabzi was also nice and tasty",4,
"we visited this place during a weekend so it was jampacked and a tad bit noisy
however the service was polite and prompt we ordered schezwan noodles and manchurian using zomato gold
the food was fine overall nothing extraordinary the noodles were a little too spicy",3,
we had south indian meal here food was amazing loved drumstick n tomato curry staff is very polite in dealing banana served with the meal is a bingo will try north indian thali too and other cuisines as well,5,
"food is good in taste specially the rotis are very soft and crispy kadhai paneer was okay as it was not really a kadhai paneer basically a paneer curry
service is quick overall a value for money",4,
food tastes goodwe had hara bara kabaab aachar paneer tikka in startersstarters are okk not so great in main course we had paneer lababdar and veg angaraveg angara is deliciousmust try dish patiala lassi is not up to the markoverall food is okkkbut service ia very badmanagement should concentrate on service as well,3,
"cool interior service was bit slow being a punjabi loved their punjabi playlist and punjabi food

food  dahi kabab were amazing served with mint chutney and spicy onions  455
garlic naan paneer do pyaza was usual 35",4,
"i have been to place many times really nice food high on price side but that is okay because they serve a good north indian food
would recommend tandoori momos from this place",4,
if you love butter chicken you can not miss out on this place butter chicken and naan and you will be satisfied nothing more that is needed brings in the true punjab to hyderabad,4,
"definitely worth a try if you are looking for some lip smacking north indian food

must try kadai paneer garlic naan shikari murgh dum ke aloo and chicken nachos

patiala lassi is a must try as well but i was not too happy about it cause it did not have much authenticity to it it sure would be a game changer if they brought in some changes to it",4,
"i went to this place for a lunch with my friend we were the first one to land at the restaurant  sharp 12noon yeah we were actually hungry i liked the place  decoration was awesome cool interior we ordered veg machaow soup masala papad butter naan paneer massallam and masala cold drinks please do note they give only masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink we liked the food taste was good but the cold drink was tasteless  i guess it was already opened one so could not get the taste bar that everything was good ambiance was actually the best  decoration the and ample space but service could have been good and fast

"love the food here but not today 
dahi ke kabab  most favourite  not today small kebab no dahi
dhabe di daal  big ginger chuncks
tandoori roti  not cooked

service on slower end wish ordered food on swiggy than coming down its better when delivered 

had food but not enjoyed please keep the taste and service top notch wish you good luck",3,
we had ordered the spicy mutter paratha 25 and the mooli paratha 35 the parathas were thick and there was no butter on them it comes with a drink35 and dal makhani35 now i am not a regular paratha eater but occasionally i love my aloo gobi and mooli ke parathe i have always ordered and found them to be good but this time i was disappointed from the looks of the paratha i am sorry to say this but it did not look very punjabi punjabis know their paratha well and wouldnt compromise on it cheers,2,
we visited this place during weekdays this place is at prime location  easily accessible and has good ambience we ordered tandoori and lasooni tikka both of them were under cooked and were not worth it  main course was not good either servings were taking lot of time to complete,2,
we a bunch of friends went for a holiday dinner ordered tandoori murg lasuni murgh tikka both the dishes were under cooked masala was not cooked at all had to throw away,1,
worst dal khichdi ever very less quantity expected a very good taste and quantity just pathetic service restaurant should check before serving the food if you are going to maintain such poor quality it is not going to work for you,1,
"good ambience
tried manchow souprotidal makhaniraita
all were very good in taste 
i tried thali once that was also good and enough for one person",4,
"i visited this place with my friend it is there right in the heart of gachibowli is indiranagar vinayak nagar

upon entering you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant which it is the ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off there are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight

then comes the interaction with the staff they are quite friendly and hard working too they do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark

menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates i really liked the way they split between veg and nonveg food

we ordered quite a lot of stuff but i really liked the dahi kebab it was good but with such good starter i had pinned my hopes on patiala lassi but that was an anti climax of sorts they used essence for the lassi i hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top that will surely be a game changer

overall it was a mixed experience and hence 35",3,
food was simply superbpunjabi food was very delicious and also if we go to restaurant service was also really goodambience is also very niceand the restaurant was very peaceful to sit and enjoy food,5,
good ambiance and song playlist  excellent place for deshi food lovers i tried nonveg and it was really tastymust try murghmussalam,5,
"when you are looking for some lip smacking north indian food gal punjab di is the answer
i have tried a lot of things here and my personal favorites are

salads chana chaat
starter dahi ke kebabs
jwalamukhi tikka
achari paneer tikka
main course paneer mussalam
beverages patiyala lassi and shikanji

taste 45
portion 45
quality 455

a decent place to dine in with family and friends",4,
"good place to have a good north indian meal they have many options and the food tastes really good we ordered masala papad dal makhni and paneer lababdar along with some breads the service was not so quick and we had to wait our fair share to get our food paneer lababdar was very tasty and so was the dal makhni

paneer lababdar  485
dal makhni  445
ambience  35
overall  45",4,
"pretty ambiance and comfortable seating ac was not functioning properly so it was lil uncomfortable otherwise everything was fine
we opted for 599 unlimited menu gosh it has like so many items that you will get confused what to order main course was great the butter chicken and mutton were cooked properly and tasted really amazing however the chicken starters were lil salty

service needs a lot of improvement service is really slow but then the staff is really courteous
should really come back to this place to try some more dishes from the menu as i am sure they will be great",4,
"i guess one of the decent punjabi restaurants in gachibowli
punjabi murg palang todh is a must try with amritsari lassi the service and ambience is decent as well",4,
we ordered butter chicken paneer makhani dal makhani and mango lassi the gravies had no distinctive flavor they were overtly sweet and tasted nothing like the original dishes the dal makhani was tolerable but not good since it is mango season expected the mango lassi to be made of fresh ingredients our fault for not checking expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews,1,
"food is good but hygiene can be improved a lot saw cockroaches moving around the restaurant
service takes longer than expected a little expensive considering the bland ambience and service",3,
amazing food we had both veg and non veg food and both were pretty tasty very creatively done interior the ambience reminds you of north indian dhabas very beautiful place the cutlery used looks cool too,5,
"nai they do not have any punjabi gal

first things first really not happy with their service two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers

so finally we got our order after 2025 min of wait the lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell in starters amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai this came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad it was the flour which got stale over the time may be do not know how they served it so we ordered boneless murg i guess it was murg musalam this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken

overall one time try stop",3,
"food tastes great for a quaint little place snuck in inner lanes of gachibowli the place is lively with punjabi music and the friendly staff

as vegans that eat food with little oil and spice three of us had a sumptuous meal that comprised of tandoori aloo and kebab as starters the initial order of a different kebab was sent back as the chef did not comply with our littleno spice request our order of aloo parantha and veg kolhapuri came as requested however the ajwain laccha parantha and roti came laced with butterghee the bread was replaced in 5 min or so as requested aloo parantha combo came along with raita and chole we requested raita to be replaced with another serving of chole and the staff gladly obliged

barring the few delays due to noncompliance of our requests we found the food to be delightful tasty and filling for a weekday dinner the shikanji was great too the staff are courteous but definitely could do well with internal communication with the chefs to ensure requests are fulfilled go for it",4,
"this is a goto place for people staying in and around gachibowli finger licking punjabi food even a simple dal and roti tastes amazing here
the lassi is the best outta everything very filling and taste satiating food
great ambience with punjabi music on and the staff is very courteous as well
you can have absolutely anything here and it would turn out to be good
love this place ",5,
"ordered non veg mini thali through swiggy delivery was quick and packaging was perfect
it had dal makhani chicken curry raita rice and tandoori roti dal makhani was good and rest all items were just average tandoori rotis were hard did not like it
chicken curry was a big disappointment though tasted bland
taste 25
quantity  25",2,
"we tried

paneer patiala  55
kadi pakodi  45 still really good

all rotis were also good

methi missi roti
ajwaini laccha paratha
butter naan
jeera rice",5,
"have ordered from gal punjab di few times now have tried dal makhani paneer tikka jwalamukhi series veg dildaraalll of which very tasty this time ordered veg nizam handi in white gravy and mushroom manchurian

nizami handi was very rich heavy but very tasty it could have more balanced mix of vegetables and cream gravy dont go by the photo taste was good

mushroom manchurian is something i have never had before tasted like manchurian personally still prefer good ol manchurian can definitively try if you have not eaten beforebit meaty in taste

while review is on zomato swiggy delivery was amazinghot hot food right from restaurant kitchen",4,
"if you are looking for punjabi food then this restaurant deserves to be in your list
the place was small but with a nice ambience nice place for dinner
ordered
for starters nri nanja 45
it is a form of desi pizza kind good combination of tastes and something innovative

for main course aloo onion paratha amritsari kulcha and judwa paneer 45
one plate of parathakulcha is enough for one person the side serving are also good in taste judwa paneer was also good

last but not the least the patiyala lassi this is something one should try for sure if u r a lassi lover
overall had a good experience would visit again soon",4,
i will be rating it as 35 stars than 4 stars this place got good ambience and interior design the service is good and even the starters are nice the only place that it fails to impress is the main course no matter which chicken curry u order they all taste similar with slight change in the level of spice composition,4,
good food combinations and taste decent service however the location of the restaurant could have been better the quantity is relatively less for the price,4,
"have been to this place on sunday the starters jawalamukhi tikka and chilly paneer was very delicious and paneer was so soft that it jst melted in mouth in main course paneer lababdar tasted little sweet and lacha partha was not worth anyways jeera rice and dal tadka was like authentic punjabi taste
ambience was good but it was too noisy
overall the experience was great",4,
"ordered kamaal ka murg  angara  no value for money the taste was that of uncooked masala with no trace of oil  did not seem to be cooked at all  the chicken was coated in curry ",1,
"not too good but okok have better option nearby need better option for punjabi food
world seems really small everywhere you get punjabi food
punjabi stereotypicalfood boring",3,
"finally found something in hyderabad that tastes like north indian food tried the chilli chicken and thankfully it came without curry leaves also ordered roomali roti which was quite large in size

packaging 45
taste 355
quantity 45

will i order again definitely",3,
"i have been to this place twice till now it is one of the good places for punjabi food at gachibowli
among starters i have tasted crispy corn and desi chicken nachos which were very good
in the main course i have tasted dhuni dum ke aloo and judwa paneer with butter naan dhuni dum ke aloo stuffed aloo in rich gravy was amazing but judwa paneer was just ok
overall it was a good experience and i would rate this place as

great place been there more than a couple of times loved the food especially the lassi would definitely want to go again sometime at least for the lassi p,5,
had their speciality  makee di roti  sanson ka saag  no where close to what a real saag  gazar ka halwa  omg  chef never had gazar ka halwa in life  so pathetic  giving 2 rating as starter was good  paneer szechwan  good ambience pricing also very decent but overall taste of punjab missing,2,
small restaurant staff is professional food i would say was average i had ordered naan dhaba style chicken curry which was ok dal makhani was awesomei did not like the gajar ka halwa it was too dry,3,
this place has a good ambience however the food is not up to the mark the staff usually takes a lot of time to bring the food which is also not mouthwatering undoubtedly gal punjab di can improve,2,
everything is punjabi about this place be it food music or ambience the food would satisfy a palate craving the taste of the dhabas of punjab makki ki roti te sarson ka saag and daal makhani are a must try,4,
"neither too big nor too small nice ambiance with punjabi touch food is tasty and value for money apart from other places

service is little slow but manageable portions are quite big there dal makhni taste very good
go to place to have nice north indian food",4,
"we were 5 members and we went for lunch during our office hours the moment i entered the restaurant i could get that desi and pure punjabi vibe the interiors are such beautifully done now coming to the service it was a bit slower here comes the protagonist of the story the food nd it took away all the negatives the restaurant has though it did not have many we ordered

starters 

chicken keema nachos

main course 

shikari murgh
kadahi paneer

rice
chicken biryani

i recommend this place
gal punjab di",4,
been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food but my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish butter chicken which was ordered more did not meet the taste buds the chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer the only dish which met our expectation was patiala lassi this drags me to this place again n again hope such things will be taken in near future,3,
"i regularly order from this place and also personally had visited this place
this restaurant offers tasty food
the service at the restaurant can be improved the steward was not responsive

i recently ordered veg thali through delivery it had
2 roti tandoori
panner butter masala
dal makhni
raita
rice
the food was good and tasty in budget as well the packing contained a plastic cover which was a bit hassle to remove
overall i liked it",3,
ordered paneer tikka and tastes good and delivered on time but one thing was there is packaging packaging was not good as some of the tikkas got messed up but overall taste was good,4,
went here on last friday i did not knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went food here was awesome i had ordered for dahi kebab and it was outstanding the food presentation and quality and taste all were good  would certainly love to visit this place again hope they keep continuing their good work,4,
"when you love food and especially north indian food you crave for the perfect butter chicken that you would probably get up north

i guess i finally seemed to have found it in hyderabad

having been to the best indian food joints like grand trunk norfest i guess the butter chicken here ranks at the top each one of them are good in their own regard though

i landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through zomato but through swiggy  somehow that is an irony given that both deliver the same distance zomato does not deliver from here to my place

so probably i will not comment on ambience and service will update that later once i visit the place but food is something that is outstanding

in the last 20 days i would have ordered 34 times that is a lot for me given that i do not get fixated to a place as i m more of a food explorer 

the food has not disappointed me so far items tried so far
punjabi butter chicken  must recommend  the best you will find in town
veg angara  good
bhatti kamurg  must try
tandoori momo  can be avoided
dahi ke kebab  brilliant for vegetarians
murg malai kebab  good
murg tikka masala  must recommend the best part is that both the gravy is  of this and butter chicken are completely different which is hard to find a person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
dal makhani  must try
tandoori murgh  must try

so that pretty much sums up my journey with the restaurant for the past 3 weeks it is awesome do try if they deliver to ur place

overall 4

loved the place",4,
"i should say the ambience is excellent we ordered chicken jwalamukhi tikka which was mouth watering and yummy but the butter chicken was a let down i could not find cheese in my chilly cheese naan laccha paratha was ok
shikanji is a mix of lemon and mint and people who like the combo will like that
lassi is thick and as punjabi as u like",3,
"as they promise best butter chicken its not true butter chicken was not that creamy and smooth it was missing that hint ambience is good other things were good menu is quite funky decor is punjabi theme
they need to improve thier service",4,
"i usually do not eat fish but i tried amritsari fish tikka here tasted good and in main course quantity of the curry served is less
overall experience  4",4,
we have ordered 2 non veg thalis for dinner after an hour restaurant cancelled the delivery saying that they got more delivery and will not be able to deliver the order why are you accepting the delivery at first place previously the restaurant was small and service was awesome but after expansion quality of food and service have detoriated,1,
i set up high expectations for the place with respect to punjabi food but the food was okok the lassi was very nice the price is reasonable,3,
"i have visited this place thrice the place is located in a busiest place in indira nagar gachibowli where the crowd is usually more
so coming to the experience from the sum of these visits i can surely recommend you to try this restaurant  as it gives a flavour of punjab in their dishes truly it goes with the name

"food from this place is consistent

have ordered more than a couple of times from the place and was never disappointed

their dal makhni is to die for great in taste

i have also tried their mix parottas and they could not have done it any better

they charge you for containers and the packing will not disappoint you

overall a great experience

i am dining at this place soon",5,
"a lazy sunday afternoon i was glad to have ordered from this restaurant perfect taste and great delivery

i chose the north indian thali with the paneer option they also served dal and raita the rotis were soft and rice was good as well

an ideal place to eat north indian food with a very little pocket burn ",4,
"if you are looking for north indian food
in hyderabad then do not visit this place the waiters will not listen if food is late manager is totally uncivilized tries to peek into customers wallet and also talks rudely  

we ordered 

1 daal makhani not even average

2 paneer serverd with hair in it

3 biriyani below average

note  do not eat paratha if you are on diet  ",5,
it is a small place so gets crowded easily and noisy easily although the interior is interesting do not expect much of an ambiance service was prompt and their happy faces was refreshing after a long day we just tried limited items and they were decent good to visit for a quick nonnonsense dinner,3,

average place with average food and ambience they claim to be a punjabi restaurant but not really punjabi at core the food is just ok with okayish ambience,3,
decor n all great reviews bought me here with high expectations the food was rancid and did not look well prepared or freshly made i ordered some cheese kofta it was hard as a rock that kofta overall super weird punjabi food easy on the pocket but it is not something i would try again,1,
"taste of food was very good specifically palangtod chicken one of best chicken curry that i ever eat since this was panjabi restorant so do not expect hyderabad dum biryani but their biryani still very good i would say on top of all lassi was just awesome price is also very decent so value for money

further improvement could be service time but not a big concern",5,
craving for punjabi food in hyderabad this one is the best one in hyderabad they serve the authentic punjabi food and even they have their chef and cooks from punjab region their butter chicken veg basket lassi makki roti are heavenly,5,
rotis not baked well,2,
you do not need a silver fork to eat good food like wise a very hifi ambience is never good when one is hungry especially for the monday blues perfect place for authentic punjabinorth indian style veg and non veg to have ordered paneer kebab egg burji punjabi butter chicken lacha paratha butter naan and rumali roti perfectly cooked tastes awesome loved the food service and ambience will visit once again keep doing the good work guys,4,
"this is a small punjabi cuisine restaurant where we went for dinner dahi ke kawab was awesome also the paneer lababdar was delicious we did not like the rotis much the naan was little thicker than it should be and the lachha paratha was more oily but overall we liked the food the service is also good the waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner we will definitely visit again to try other dishes
updatewent recently on independence day the paneery curry was just color and chilli powder the paneer pieces were also very stiff the rotis were also very rubbery",3,

ambience  undoubtedly quirky  eye catching
food  we had ordered sava futiya seekh kabab lassuni chicken tikka  bhatti da murgh for starters since i had my kids along had to keep in mind the spice levels the tikkas were juicy  succulent  extremely delicious
stuffing ourselves with the starters we settled for dal makhani with missi roti  lachcha parathas for we could not eat in more

the menu card in itself is very quirky it actually sparks up a thought of actually tasting those times
 sheela ki shashlik

the biryani here i found very delicious but needs more improvement in taste all spices were blended and mixed well but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste,3,
me and my colleagues keep visiting this place every friday as it is very near to the office space no much ambiance simple restaurant booking is preferred on friday is as it gets too much crowdy after 1pm staff isnt courteous at all they always keep a sad face dont know why hopefully they are given some training to smile biryani taste is amazing as i am vegetarian i usually take andhra veg biryani avakaya biryani or kaju biryani all of them are perfectly made so all the rating is for only the taste not for service and ambiance at all,4,
"been here twice we have ordered biryani is there were different varieties of biryanis served here however the taste was quite average since the name of the restaurant itself contains biryani that too in city of hyderabad the expectations were high being a lover of biryani and comparing with other local biryani restaurants it missed that magic
the portion of food served was also less",3,
"i have been ordering from this place for quite some time now i have tried various types of veg biryanis available my personal favourites are veg biryani capsicum and mushroom biryani mixed veg biryani
recently i ordered paneer tikka biryani which was really bad and i advice you to avoid ordering it
overall it is a good place to try out different kinds of biryanis",4,
taste was good but it took about an hour and half just for the starters to arrive the veg keema biryani had a complete coconut flavor which we did not particularly enjoy,3,
"having heard a lot about this place specially their triveni biryani i came here once and ordered food 34 times

the last time i purchased food here would actually be the last time i would eat from here

this restaurant is a classic example of how it started on a grand note and ended up being just another restaurant with hygiene issues

to cut the long chase short i had purchased 2 items 1 paneer tikka biryani and bhimwaram pulav take aways

in spite of telling them both items were very spicy my wife and i were struggling with the food now to top it i found a flying insect not a cockroach but something else with wings that got cooked with the paneer tikka biryani

alas that was so repulsive that i left the food mid way and satiated my hunger with curd rice

i am never going back to them",1,
"worst food everplease do not believe the ratings  reviews mentioned below both veg and non veg were bad 
utterly disappointed after have a team party over there based the these many ve reviews",1,
the taste of biryani is excellentand again i ordered butter naans it is also good tasteservice also good it is cost effective but vegetarian curries are less varieties,4,
it is low spicy and good food do not expect too much having a light dinner this place is good food is good but i am not recommending to anybody,3,
"i cant fully comment or give a full 5 star rating but i would definitely start with a 4 star as the kebabs i ordered were simply one of the best i have ever had 

i ordered chicken malai kebab and chicken hara mirchi kebab both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them i really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor while the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab i preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab

although a bit on the pricier side given the flavors and the taste i am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything the biryani would definitely be flavorsome 

food  55
value for money  45",4,
the worst experience ever had if you order a biryani you will get an oil packet free in it hope you can get it if you ask for a manager they says there is no manager,1,
the taste was not yet goodit is was too oil in biryani and while we are asking to the manager he said that it was gheeno proper response from them,1,
the worst food i ever had i came with a team of 20 this seems to be my worst experience never an going to come the chef do not speak the managers do not know what is being served above all biryani is cooked with oil enough to cook 4curries what a pitiful condition no feedbacks forms available,1,
" biryani the popular dish in hyderabad and yeah the most known dish throughout india
biryani is and more is one such place where wide spread of biryani is are available it has few outlet in hyderabad i visited to gachibowli outlet it is located near biodiversity  beside care hospital gachibowli this place is easily accessible as it on main road its in ground floor of the building particular i wanted to this place to taste some biryani is i have been here for dinner with group of friends
soon i went in i was greeted by the friendly staff and incredible aroma of biryani is from other diner is  we managed to snag our table

being settled down we ordered few mocktails
mango lassi as this is season of mango is  ginger lemon ginger cola lemon soda sparkling blue each of the mocktails looked picturesque

mango lassi and lemon soda were best out of all rest other mocktails were good

to start with dinner we had soups
lemon coriander  this is a clear soup along with some broccoli carrot veggies gave us a delicious taste and it is a healthy soup to start with
chicken machow soup fried noodles were added on top od chicken soup

appetizers
we have order crispy veg corn 65 apolo fish tender chicken bangla kodi chilli prawns

crispy veg all vegetable onions potato carrot were deep fried
it tasted average
it can be better

corn 65 corn kernels were mixed with floor  and some ingredients corn kernels are made in to balls and than deep fried served with mayo

tender chicken prawns are must try here

main course  avakya chicken biryani afghani biryani is  veg noodles

veg noodles vegetable in it makes the noodle to give crunchy texture sauces gives us a distinctive flavour noodles were soft somehow i liked the noodles here
afghani chicken biryani it is one exclusive biryani here on top of biryani they serve omlet

we have ordered some indian bread with tomato cashew and chicken curry
tomato curry with cashew was best one i had  so in hyderabad

one cannot end dinner without desserts
we have ordered junnu jamun kurbani ka meeta i liked the jamun here it was soft and tasted yummy
i had a bad experience with junnu  everyone has a off night now and again may b on that day junnu was bad",4,
"just the name of biryani and hyderabadis get hunger pangs and so did we when we heard about biryanis and more at gachibowli for a food tasting session biryanis and more is a popular name in the food industry with its branches in usa as well they are trying to spread the love for biryani across the globe with their lipsmacking varieties of biryani and after a a few outlets in hyderabad the newest was opened in gachibowli opposite to nissan showroom or opposite to biodiversity complex the place is very easy to locate though a small outlet but yet incredible simple interiors with the place efficiently used for the seating the staff was really friendly and attentive and a special mention to a staff member sudhir who took good care of us right from the moment we entered to the time we left  we being completely unaware of the menu thought that this place would be just about biryanisbut to our surprise this place serves variety of other dishes which are really appetizing we started off with the shakes we were served the mango lassi ginger cola ginger lemon sparkling blue and virgin mojito and all of them were soo refreshing specially the sparkling blue and the ginger cola  next we had the soups we were served the lemon coriander soup and the chicken manchow soup they were good and next came the starters and we had the apollo fish chilli prawns tender chicken bangla kodi corn 65 and crispy veg the best and the must have dish among them was the tender chicken the chicken pieces were really fleshy and juicy which were well marinated and fried with breadcrumbs it was both tender and crispy at the same time really enjoyed this dish and the bangla kodi a dish which was very new to us it was something very unique tasty and spicy it is made with baked potatoes with chicken filling and then it is deeply fried you definitely should try this if you have not crispy veg made with the flour batter mixed with different veggies like onion carrots etc tasted yumm and corn 65 was amazing soo delectable and tasty and a completely different kind of experience for a person who have always had chicken 65 the sea food was a little here and there prawns were a little salty and the fish was not cooked really wellsoo there is a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food but they have covered it all up with their delicious biryanis a complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well we had the ulavacharu chicken biryani chicken avakai biryani and chicken afghani biryani totally totally worth the money and just the best  ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome it is said that ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo do not forget to have some curd yoghurt or the raita to make it even and then there was this chicken avakai biryani yet another mindblowing taste avakai means mangoand this biryani is made from the spices of mangoit had the taste of the mango pickle never had we imagined that we would ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of mango pickle  then came the afghani biryaniit is just the opposite of ulavacharu and avakai when it comes to the spicy level really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top believe us if you are a biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in your list i am gonna go back again for the biryani  the other main course included naan basket with chicken tikka masala and chicken chettinadu as you must be knowing chicken chettinadu a popular dish from tamil nadu is a very spicy dish and yet very tasty and here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicyness and also the taste soo the main course here is the real stunner next we had the dessertsever wished to be ganesh gaitonde  you definitely do not want that life but yes you can enjoy the same dessert which he just loves the kharvas also called as junnu is an indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow we do not know how the actual taste of the junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was superb  you ought to have this dessert to get that gaitonde feels next in line were the gulab jamun and qubani ka meetha the presentation of the desserts is not really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good 
soo if you love to enjoy a variety in biryani then biryanis and more should be your next stop  you are going to love it",4,

the lovely place is properly situated at the prominent cross roads of biodiversity gachibowli right opposite to nissan showroom the place and its ambiance is quite cozy as the lighting is subtle and ambient which blends in pretty well with the interiors of the restaurant the staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to mr sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner

as soon as we sat down we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails a group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely sparking blue mango lassi ginger cola ginger lemons virgin mojito masala cola out of all the mocktails masala cola and mango lassi stood out and were the best the other mocktails were equally good and refreshing

delicious appetizers

crispy veg a variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that was not new that we did not have but it tasted excellent

corn 65 it tasted absolutely delicious corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel thoroughly recommended

bangla kodi which was a signature dish of the restaurant but for us it was a dish that also stood apart

chilli prawns spicy stirred fried it tasted awesome

tender chicken the star of the appetizers brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter highly recommended please do not miss out on this dish

apollo fish so it was a fish apart from that about the taste was okaysish

main course

chettinad chicken very spicy and it went absolutely well with the butter naan

kolhapuri chicken mild flavours the taste was good

uluvacharu chicken biryani this was the highlight of the dinner unique taste and flavors the restaurant lived up to the name of biryani highly recommended

avakai chicken biryani a novel kind of taste for me and i really liked it

afghani chicken biryani mild flavor biryani topped with eggomelet it tasted really good

desserts

qubani ka meetha junnu and gulab jamun were served to us and we were extremely dissatisfied with the desserts i earnestly request the effective management to please look into the dessert part everything else made it a great evening to hang out with family and friends for good indian biryani flavours

all the mocktails were of different colours making them very appealing for us to drink
almost all the mocktails had mintlemon and ice which was refreshing
the mango lassi was too sweet
then we were served with soups

the veg lemon coriander soup was served hot with parboiled broccoli
the chicken manchow soup was full of flavour and was served with crispy fried noodlesit tasted delicious
we were then served with starters

the fish was well cooked and soft but had so much of salt in it
tender chicken
this was something very tastythe chicken was softtender and with good amount of spice
bangla kodi
it is one of the most popular dishesit was crispylight and was well presented with coriander garnish
the chilli prawns
the prawns were juicyspicy and had great flavour
crispy veg and corn 65 were other vegetarian starters which we had
they also were good but not that great
next we were served with main course
they served us different types of curry is with indian breads
the chicken chetinaduits a spicy chicken curry which was too good
the other curry is were chicken tikka masalatomato cashew nut and ulvacharu chicken

afghani chicken biryani

avakai chicken biryani is a authentic andhra dishit had a wonderful taste still haunting
afghani chicken biryani is very different from other biryaniit had unique flavour
it was served with egg omelet above the biryani 
we ended up our meal with deserts
qubani ka meethagulab jamun and junnu

serving not upto the basic standards place smells wierd and costs not at all fair not a preferred place for vegetarians most of the items on the menu not available,2,
"food is good but service is not that good and charged price different from one in menu
items are worth but not good courtesy and customer is not treated well",3,
visited this place for the first time tried gongura mutton biryani and tuglaq biryani both the dishes tasted decent but they did not justify the biryani tag line tuglaq biryani tasted more of pulav and it nowhere can stand near biryani the amount of meat given is not on par with the money you shed ambience is decent and the staff are quite courteous,4,
biryani is good specially bamboo chicken is awesome it just melts in your mouth one star minus for not having most of the items mentioned in the menu,4,
biryanis are good in taste and healthy the below desserts are not worth the cost and the quality of desserts  khurbani ka meetha and gulab jamun is very poor we have taken takeaway so overall the biryanis are good in taste,4,
"poor service and rally horrible customer service specifically the person named imran really mis behaves and do not take the order properly and was kind of threatening food quality is also not up to mark and importantly the behaviour of staffs as mentioned by imran is very bad ",1,

biriyanis and more you were amazing to help me out with my foods during my hyderabad stay i liked the flavors of andhra in their cuisine i ordered chicken tikka biriyani with tandoori chicken and coke i liked biriyani which was plentiful nice customer service as they were always ready to serve good ambience and locality i loved my experience at this restaurant in gachibowli,4,
the most comforting biryani that satisfied my taste buds is from biryanis with just the right amount of spices boneless chicken biryani served here is my go to food on any day bhimavaram mixed pulav is a must try,5,
"a great restaurant and a wonderful experience
1 the ambiance is on the spot and attractive with white and red combination spacious and have a separate waiting  space which is impressive
2 service is great manager too but i think the presentation of food and table decoration can be a little improved it could be more premium
3 food is awesome i think it is the hyderabad is finest biriyani i have ever had had panner biriyani awakai biriyani couple of staters and tomato soup which is really good

overall its worth the cost and a pleasant place for family and friends",5,
my order was changed,1,
got nice food but packing not good in this restaurant best food item is fry pice biryani is the best birani i never eat before please prepare food packaging neat,3,
good food and a very crowded place on friday afternoonlemon coriander chicken and bamboo chichen are good in startersmutton dum biryani green chilli kodi pulav are the best,4,
"i ordered veg manchuryia and fried piece chicken biryani manchuryia was not hot and taste was below avg  same with biryani too taste was below avg as name itself biryanis and more people will expect min taste and service was very poor every time i should remember them to bring water bottle  manchuryia biryani and after that we should call them and ask to serve  it is very bad experience in my recent times ",2,
baby corn is not there in paneer and corn biryani,4,
"ambiance35
the place is simple and sober nothing fancy 

food 45 
chicken 65 it has strong garlicy and gingery aroma medium spicy soft boneless starter 
paneer tikka smoky soft paneer 
ulvachuru biryani yummy  rice along with some red colored gravy gave it a nice juicy touch however they used regular rice we were expecting basmati rice 

moderately priced 800 for the above three dishes 
quick service and courteous staff",4,
"i ordered my lunch from this place and it was really disappointing experience for me i had ordered garlic naan chicken patiala pepper chicken and chicken majestic
garlic naan was somewhat ok but chicken patiala was not at all as expected it was somewhat sweet and with a different color and the taste was also not good
pepper chicken was over fried which was giving a burnt taste
chicken majestic was also not that good thin strips of chicken being served which serves any justification to the name itself neither by it is taste nor appearance
my personal experience with biryanis and more was not at all good",2,
restaurant must be preserving the old veggies i ordered veg paneer babycorn biryani babycorn was rotten completely i felt pathetic after eating rest of the food was fine this restaurant has wide variety of biryanis and makes it still a preferred place,2,
"i have came here for my lunch
items are in menu card only not in kitchen what ever i have asked server saying not available sir almost 5 items he said not there even some of them are from there special once
so finally i have asked him to get what ever is there in the kitchen
the disappointed lunch at biryans
finally if you want to have only biryani come here ",1,
very good quality food and tasty as well,5,
"i love grilled chicken with pudina chutney in this restuarant and also bhimavaram mixed pulao will be super tasty there is no private room if you go with
the big team apart from that food be will good for non veg lovers",4,
thank you,5,
taste was good here and of course ppl were waiting more than 12 hour to get the tables inside as expected yes restaurant will meet our expectations prices are okay and taste is quite good but only thing is need to wait for some time to get items not sure whether this happened bcoz of huge rush,4,
gud,5,
rates high quantity less,4,
visited this place today food is no doubt good but the service is awful we had to wait more than 30 minutes for the food to be served that too when we asked then they served the staff was rude as well had to ask for every little thing even the basic services were very bad would suggest the owner to improve the staff and services,2,
test is good but food is not hot,4,
triveni biryani was awesome,4,
"awesome ",5,
the food here is excellenti have tried the veg and non veg both are good at tastethe cost is more compared to the quantity of the biryani,4,

"been there for a team lunch ordered ulvacharu mutton biryani chicken pulao and bamboo chicken
ulvacharu mutton biryani 5stars was the winner everyone in the team absolutely loved it
bamboo chicken 3 stars although it was cooked in a bamboo it was not hot and the bamboo looked like it was already used earlier after complaining to the manager they served it again and then it was hot and nice
chicken pulao was good
staff is very polite
over all a good experience definitely 35 stars and above",4,

test is very good,5,
service is good,5,
"i visited the place with my colleagues we were around 15 people though the ambience was good and food tasted okay it is not worth the money the real problem is that the place is quite congested in the first place you will have to go quite early to avoid wait time but that did not help us either i was extremely disappointed with the service we waited for almost like 1 hour for the food to arrive by the time the veg food arrived add on is that the soup came after starters were brought our nonveg friends were having the maincourse the staff was not apologetic at all

i would not prefer to have food here again

plus you will find hell lot of flies around all the time i was waving over my food ",2,
food not good,2,
seems vegetable was not washed properly hence got lot of white stone chunks between teeth is,2,
thank you,5,
not delivered intime,2,
great,5,
too bad but tasty,1,
very less quantitynot value for the price,1,
though a it is a small place and would be over crowded all the time the food quality is what makes us visit the place again and again one should try tughlaq biriyani if visiting this place,4,
good taste and quantity,5,
gud food but more price,5,
a classy restaurant in gachibowli area that serves super awesome hyderabadi food at a very reasonal price the waiters are polite and accommodate any special request you have as to how the food has to prepared,5,
it is closed as of 14th may it is not mentioned on zomato please call before you visit this place i wanted to take my parents to the place but they referred me to mustang,1,
"the taste was really good in non veg starters in veg paneer starter was awesome and butter non are very soft and good
nice place to visit
good staff and very polite",5,
"kalmi kebab and lemon coriander soup is an all time fav combo for me whenever i visit this place the taste has been consistent over the time 
staff is courteous and ambience is good  quiet place",4,
ambience and food both was okish we had taken buffet not much options and even the food options available were not much delicious not a place i would recommend,2,
worst service worst staff worst food waste of every penny i spent here they did not even apologise for the mistake they have done while billing,1,
"went for a lunch on a weekend ordered a biryani in which i felt the rice to be slightly undercooked the chicken do pyaza ordered had chicken pieces which were not mixed well with the gravy ambience is not same as what is seen in the photos staff is courteous but lacks experience in hospitality
could be much better",3,
one of my worst dining experience ever the staff took one and half hour to serve the main course and another half an hour to provide cutleryway to ruin my bday dinner with my parents with me actually leaving the restaurant empty stomach,1,
"i went to the diners pavilion gachibowli on april 14 2019 at 815 pm to attend the birthday party of my friend is child is birthday i asked security about valet parking and he said yes there is valet parking so i gave key to park my car in fact that security guy was very unprofessional and he never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a nonparking area i was shocked when i received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th apr 2019 for traffic violation in fact it is very impractical and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information if restaurant does not have valet parking then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car

with situation i have no choice so i have paid the amount of challan but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking

really i am very upset with this type of irresponsible behavior i never faced such a kind of experience in my life",1,
been to this place very recently as one of my friend suggested me to try this outambience wise it was decentdid not had much rush or was not that crowded nice place food was good had crispy cornbira and corona  chicken spicy table which i liked it among alllaila biryani which i first heard and had in pine and dine and after that i am having that biryani hereended up with mockatil dp special which was blend of guava and peachit was goodcan try this place once,3,
"from what i have heard about this place is that it is more popular for its spread in lunch buffet but we decided that we would debut this place for some drinks postwork and barged into this otherwise dessert place around 930 in the night not very crowded on a weekday nice ambience clean washrooms wide options to choose for drinks and food decently priced and quick service  qualities we usually look for in any good restaurant 

oh and they have a thing with throwing a desi touch to their dishes which i liked it

we had 6 bottles of beer at inr 700

food do not remember the prices
chicken caesar salad
chicken peri peri pizza
chicken chipote skewers

overall loved my experience would definitely go again perhaps to try their lunch buffet",4,
"visited this restaurant on a wednesday night and it was empty with only one table occupied zomato gold confirmation was quick and we ordered a bucket of budweiser which was offered at 700 6pints ordered chicken peri peri pizza chicken chipotle skewers and chicken ceaser salad all three items were good and specially the pizza they undoubtedly serve one of the best pizzas in town  very soft thin crust and very tasty 5 stars for their pizza

chicken chipotle skewers were little chewy but tasted really good ceaser salad was very good too service by aumit was appreciated

would love to visit again for trying their other items in menu",4,
it was random plan to visit this place and turned out to be great we ordered chicken biryani boneless had some different name i forgot but taste is something i cant forget  also we ordered paneer starter which was good too loved the place though service was little slow but manageable,5,
it average restaurant while preferring to buffet there will be no much varieties but ambience wise it looks good nothing great here routine buffet system has to implement to new kind of varieties,3,
a calm fourth floor restaurant interior decoration is very pleasant ordered mint mojito kaju rice murgh palak they accept zomato gold for food the foods were nice tasty but price a little costlier according to the quantity they served especially the rice quantity mojito was truly expensive 199 per drink otherwise good place to visit for those who do not love noisy place like me,5,
"ambience is average
food is awesome although starters quantity served is less in comparison of price but taste covers it is all

must visit place",5,
this place is one of my favourites as it will always be emptyyou can plan anytime and visitthey serve food a bit late to order accordinglyamount is very good meat balls soup is must have and nijami paneer is also very good,4,
staff are very politely and very helpful service was excellent and the food was very tasty and good quality and the ambiance is looking very nice,5,

"one of the best place to have biryani in gachibowli
biryani is best here service is good
good thing is you can get 11 on food here enjoy the great food",5,
this was a visit to this place after a long time againthey literally surprised us this time a lot of improvement in the service due to change in staff and management food quality was also quite improved ambience is as earlier a good one must visit again for sure soon,5,
"recently visited this place for team party it did not reach up to my expectations

food is just okay kind of nothing great because we ordered soup  manchow and veg nizami chicken biryani was pathetic and in desert section also they do not give much options

service is okay and friendly but you might find difficulty to get someone who attend you if you are going to family and then you might like it",1,
"the management here is greedy
the problem came when we asked for bill in the bill they added 10 service charges and gst
we asked why again service charges when there is gst
first they denied and later reduced 10 service charge
the online payment method took 15 min to verify the payment from waiter to owner
one big suggestion is please check your bill before payment why should we pay 10 extra to these greedy people
i will never recommend this restaurant
i also have both bills and gstin number with me",1,
"this is an amazing place with a scrumptious food it looks so sophisticated and elegant in every corner
lovely ambience
polite staff
great food
nice decor of course",4,
the ambience is really nice the food items are a bit costly and i personally felt the portion sizes are less too the food items are tasty,3,
the ambience of the place is classy and good was a pleasant experience they have scope to introduce more variety in the items otherwise it is an excellent dining place,4,
the food was not up to the mark the mexican dish had too much chilli and mexican rice was like indian veg fried rice the thai dish had strong flavours overall did not like the food,3,
"i generally go to diner is pavilion for lunch  buffet   celebrating  parties

one of the best place to hangout with friendsnear gachibowli

 the food is really good in quality ambience is decent the perfect place for a  gettogether over weekend

service  staff  service was quick and staff did their best

the music was so good so all in all we had a very good experience keep it up ",5,
the food is little expensive but unlocked gold benifits so felt somewhat reasonable tried chipotle chicken skewers and chicken bbq pizza  the pizza was great and liked it a lot the service was very very slow it took 40 mnts to serve my order,3,
great food  never expected such a nice and spicy food in gachibowli  loved it  place was pleasant to hangout with friends  i recommend it strongly,5,
visited on december 23rd at 10 pm pathetic experience chess balls served as cold second drink quantity is lesser than first one first time disappointed from your service hope next time you will improve your services,1,
"went to this place recently it did not reach upto my expectations its not at all like the pictures they showed in this app
ambience was just okay its a small room with hardly 10 tables
the staff did not respond like they should 
coming to the food it is not that great there were no boneless chicken starters also the items are very limited  the main course was also disappointing
the funniest part is there were only 3 deserts which includes vanilla icecream  gulab jamun n some kind of sweet and the fruits tasted sour
this is what i got after spending 550 on the buffet
i would never recommend this place",2,
"went for a team lunch to this place and it was a very bad experience food was tasteless and cold request to staff to get hot starters went unheard

only items good on the menu was chicken biryani and gulab jamun",1,
"after thinking too much about which place to go for lunch we have decided for diners pavilion

the ambience is decent with a friendly staff

first time saw a restaurant serving egg in buffet as of me it is first experience having egg for buffet the taste of the food is superb

loved the egg starter and the welcome drink

cheers
dileep",4,
the place is know for its buffay but i tried only the thai red curry chicken with plain rice the food was really nice but the service was a tad slow,3,
"ambience good for a family dinner warm mellow lights are soothing although they should have a music system and play selected songs instead of just plugging in the tv and playing a music channel the advertisements and random songs kind of kill the ambience
food taste and quality is upto the mark we ordered pasta and salad we wanted some customizations in our order and the staff was happy to incorporate that
service and staff quick service and polite staff",4,
"we went on a thursday night pretty empty except for one more table the service was pathetic and every dish came in an average 30 mins after ordering even the naan
the food was ok and there are far better places around the service killed the taste of the food
go at your own risk",2,
nice place for team lunch and dinner staters are tasty try the stuffed mushrooms  tandi here over all ambience and service is good thanks for everything,5,
went with family on saturday nov 3rd only one more table was occupied so was worried about the place we were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time food was okay not that great taste the chicken wings were good though choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time chicken quesadillas did not taste like a quesadilla it was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti there is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time,3,
35 went here for dinner on saturday night almost empty only two other tables occupied so were sceptical anyways got seated inspite of this it took good 15 min anyone could attend us the reason cited was heavy rush in the partner restaurant above wiered however the food was served quickly we had tomato shorba veg pizza and crispy veg all items were good nothing wow to say about availed zomato gold overall ok experience nothing compelling to visit again,3,
"this place has the calm atmosphere and absolutely tasty food in a royal ambience
the staff is friendly and suggestive of their good dishes",4,
it is quiet and nice but the food is nothing beyond average the service staff was very friendly though good if you prefer privacy over food,3,
been here today with teammates and the food for non vegetarian was not up to the mark all the chicken starters had small pieces of bones every bite was with a bone the main course was just ok,2,
"we went on a monday for dinner and there was hardly anyone there looked quite spacious the music playlist is good and so is the ambience being a vegetarian i will surely recommend you to try their stuffed mushrooms succulent and delicious the ulte tawa ka paratha was pretty good too i did feel that the amount of currydal served was more than that is served at other places read my entire experience on the blog 
read full post on socialmaharajcom",4,
worst service ever seen bug in food cold food not properly cooked naan no one to listen to your request no one even to serve plates just two waiters who are busy in themselves uncourteous staff manager paid no regards not even an apology for such a bad service,1,
our first experience with diners pavilion was pretty the ambience was good they have a buffet lunch starters  live pasta and main courses was as usual tasty staff is polite and care about,5,
"went there in lunch buffet overall food quality was ok except dessert and welcome drink
the worst part was the bill provided by them was not having any gst
and when i checked with them they mentioned that they will not provide gst bills",3,
was here on a friday evening with friends for dinner they have both buffet and ala carte options available ambience is good but the service needs to be improved in terms of the staff availability for taking orders and reorders the food was quite average liked the veg nizami we ordered for main course the veg manchow soup was really bad though the taste of food can be improved overallnot a very satisfying experience,2,
"been to this place after listening a positive review from friend had lunch in this place
starters are good especially the veg ones
main course is ok
i mostly liked nizami handi and mutton curry
chicken biryani and curd rice are good

but desserts are very limited and live counter has only one option only one option in mocktail

overall ok",3,
"a goto place in gachibowli especially for team lunches  since they have an amazing offer running now
449 ai for veg and 549 ai for non veg buffet

ambience 455
the place looks pretty bright with a golden yellow theme chandeliers and wooden furnituresgives d place a royal feeling 

buffet spread 45
coming to the buffet spread i really loved the fresh and soothing welcome drink probably cranberry juice it was
as for the starters there were so many options and service was good too even at the wee hours of a friday lunch afternoon
i really loved the cheese broccoli crispy corn and chilli my among the veg ones
and in my non veg options chicken hariyali tikka fish tikka were amazing

next comes the main course although i was a little disappointed with so less variety of dishes here but the starters already filled my hunger pangs and i could only taste some cucumber mayo salad and some nicely cooked chicken dum biryani with a an okayish mutton roganjosh

last but not the least we ended our lunch with hot gulab jamun along with vanilla ice cream there were some cut fruits and butterscotch pastry too but they werent that great
yet again a disappointment in desserts section

overall i think this place should be a good option to try out especially when the prices are quite decent and the food quality is good too",4,
a huge spacious place with good ambiencei like the food here a lottoday i found out there are having live pasta in buffetstarter are yummyserves was good,5,
the ambience of this place is really good the food is not upto the mark especially italian food the room kind of setup inside the restaurant is really cool and would be ideal for a team lunchdinner,3,
probably one of the best locations in gachibowli it has been a wonderful experience the food and service was really good and very prompt we really enjoyed it keep it up,5,
the ambience is good but the food wasn t upto the mark the non veg starters were horrible full of bones the veg starters were okayish the variety was less the main course was okay there was variety but no taste there were hardly any desserts disappointed,2,
"we were here for team lunch it was good experience but there should be more desert item it was having lots of verity but quality should be updated ",4,
it was good to have a food herefor my taste and budget i was able to find good varieties of foodthe taste of veg biryani was awesome and staff also served us better,5,
nice ambiance food is good to average nothing to write home about  my only complaint is the portion size which is a tad smaller for the money u r paying we ordered hariyali tikka which was too soft n yummy one crispy fried chicken whose actual name i forgot overall a nice experience partly due to the courteous staff but food portion is something that can be looked into,3,
it has been a wonderful experience been here with my best friend to throw a party  he loved it alot  could not have asked for a better day food items where yummy and delicious for both veg and non veg service is very good,5,
awesome food good ambience  very humble staff  food also really good and testynice place everything is ok but need to lmprove of service,4,

"today is visit with friends for the lunch was a terrible experience
food  below average
service  pathetic the attitude the waiters had was shocking
we booked through call and when we reached they declined the booking after sometime they said they will arrange place we had to wait almost 15 minutes for starters and that too after one serving they were dealing second serving my previous visits were descent but this visit was super bad experience",1,
"many issues to start with 
1 no valet parking as quoted 
2 everything that was served on the plate was chilled  and i mean it
3 nothing was planned  like the placement of food  it was more of a day to day kitchen
4 on the contrary  icecream was already melt 

taste was good had it been served properly it would have definitely deserved more than 4

hope these things are taken proper care of",1,
"ambiance
diner is pavilion is located at the times square indira nagar exactly below mustang terrace lounge diner is pavilion is a casual dining restaurant famous for continental as well as north indian food a well decorated diner is pavilion has indoor sitting available with live sports screening and the silent english songs playing in the background
food and drinks
they serve beer at cost as low as approximately inr 99 in starters we usually order chicken tandoori and kebab food in here is delicious and with low cost diner is pavilion offers 11 dish on zomato gold membership

service is quite slow but the staff is polite",4,
it was wonderful experience  from the time to step in till step out from restaurant they treated every one with respect  politeness in words meal served hot and it has very good taste looking forward to checkin in this restaurant in coming days for our all events,5,
not the best experience staff is not prompt neither aware of what on the menu is actually available in the kitchen indifferent to any standards of service visited twice in 2 days had poor experience both the times,1,

"visited this place for my team lunch and the experience was pathetic
prebooked the tables online got call back from restaurant asking for some advance money for the lunch something new which i did not come across in recent times this somehow got sorted and when we came there for lunch
they are on 3rd floor when entered the lift  it was leaking water from its ceiling
entered restaurant look was good our tables were arranged we said about number of veg and non veg plates starters were served on the table
service was very bad slow and no one was very much bothered about refills had to request multiple times for refills taste was mild some lacked salt some lacked spice over all starters were ok
then comes the main course and main culprit when we reached for food most of the bowls were empty so waited for refill in the meanwhile my eyes fell on available prawns curry i got them in a bowl and few roties on my table prawns were raw yukkkkkkk not properly boiled and cooked i said this to the manager out there but got a cold response i did not try anything else in main course but some of my frnds said biryani was ok but others were bad
halwa ice cream and cut fruits were on deserts

when were were done with our lunch then manager came and apologised for the prawns and asked me to retry as he got them prepared again for me  it made me feel privileged had discussed on other items with the manager and got my prawns in a bowl to my surprise this was even pathetic experience he mixed the older ones with the new curry and made it even worse

i would highly not recommend this place
sorry sorry for choosing this place for a team lunch",1,
"beginning with the ambience its okay nothing to great about it but the food here is good the quantity in starters are less the main course is good the food items that are worth trying 
 chilli cheese naan
 shrimp fettuccine for sea food lovers only
 thread chicken

butter chicken and lal maans was okay not that great
under mocktails i tried the pino orange it was just a plain orange juice

the starters especially the fish was too salty need improvement there

the service is really good the food prices are affordable and overall a good place to have dinner",4,
went for a late lunch at this place even though the venue was booked for a birthday celebration they accommodated us at their rooftop venue of mustang the view and the overall ambience was beautiful the menu of diners pavilionthey have the same kitchen had enough choices and variety we ordered basic north indian and the food was heavenly great service and even after levying 10 service charge the bill was pretty easy on the pocket having zomato gold makes it even better all in all a great place for family lunches and dinners,5,
i ordered food from here through swiggy had a guest coming over for dinner ordered butter chicken and adraki mutton the dishes were horrendous and inedible the butter chicken had gone stale and smelt pungent the adraki mutton is gravy was nothing but oil was shocked to see such atrocious quality being sent what was more nerve wrecking was that i was banking on these dishes for my guest will never ever order from here wish i could give you a rating less than 1,1,
awesome food and ambience the staff were really quick and served food with smile overall it was a nice experience having lunch at diners pavilion,5,
"i would rate this place 4 out of 5 food  starters are tasty they do not have more variety in main course for veg people but whatever they served was tasty also i feel there should be some more variety of sweets as when we went to this place we found only ice cream cake and some halwa we visited this place around 2215 pm and we were only left in the restaurant and i believe it was there closing time so they could not give more attention to us this restaurant is worth giving a try
team dp one suggestion add some variety in sweets",4,
order 2 allo parotha got only one,1,
delivery person is not all good very much troubled with delivery man food is nice diners pavilion take thumsup,5,
"we did not had a good experience as my rating says it all

the main issue which annoyed me was the non veg was being cut just behind where veg main course was served we being vegetarian it was not a very good site

in dessert initially only halwa was there and then ice cream and gulab jamun was added

starters were also extremely salty

overall except the ambiance and good music this place is not meant for us",1,
went for lunch partyusual buffet spread but food tasted real good ambience is wonderful and interiors are neatly donestarters are served at the table value for money place very comfortable unlike other buffet spots that are crammed for space it is the usual problem in gachibowli where you have to park the cars on the road their valet parking being shared with other outlets is usually full,4,
"nice ambience45
do try 

munchow soup45
nijami handi55
fried rice35
paneer paratha35

do keep check on the bill they add service charge by default on top of gst and you will have to specifically ask them to remove it",4,
taste is good but quantity is very less for that price,4,
the food here is a total insult to restaurant business i ordered lal maas which was totally not the dish at all it looked and tasted unhealthyfull of red onions they shd hav named d dish lal piyaas neways i asked the manager to replace the dish and he insisted on trying their adrakhi malai mutton which again was not the dish they had mentioned in d menu instead of adrakh they put garlic  a lot of it with a watery type gravy upon complaining the manager said that their head chef has left for the day hence the food is not the way it is i mean dude seriously thats your reason guys pls stay away from this place its a place for disrupting ur digestives system insult to your hard earned money and insult to the mutton they procured to cook,1,
"my second visit to this place visited this restaurant once back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed this visit was better than the last one was here for a team lunch with my colleagues we opted for the buffet

the ambience of this place is decent there were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven there was no salt and pepper on the table also there were no condiments upon requesting the waiter served us ketchup and green chutney as we sat the waiters started serving the starters they included hara bhara kabab aloo tikki garlic paneer tandoori pineapple crispy corn and chilly eggs tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants crispy corn hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good the egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average

veg tom yum soup was decent the main course was a bit disappointing paneer butter masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name kashmiri pulao was not actually kashmiri pulao the two other veg curries tasted average the desserts consisted only vanilla ice cream gulab jamun and moong dal halwa this was probably the most distasteful moong dal halwa i have ever eaten

the service was prompt but this place did not give me any reason to why i should visit again at least for a buffet the only way they are different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks but i think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back

i have visited places less than 1km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food if they can not increase the varieties they should start serving differentnew food compared to others because i am not visiting again if i can have similar food and better somewhere else

bit pricey on scale however the quality is flawless worth it


1 prawns phad thai noodles 
big chunks of prawns around 56 with thai style noodles best part was the additional veggie varieties cut in style and egg chunks added to it made it stand out beyond just regular prawn noodles veggies were carrot mushrooms cucumber onion etc
moderately spicy a drink like lassibuttermilk would complement well

2 veg greek salad 
standard fresh veggie salad containing cucumbers tomato black olives onions etc with a happy twist of creamy raita 
the cream and raita accentuated the taste of the salad tenfold 
true exhibition of healthy yet tasty food

pathetic customer servicestale food and worst ever experienceon top of it found a fingernail found from the noodlesi wish i could have taken a photograph but their staff took it back to never returnhigh chances of spoiling your health eating herebeware friendsan honest feedback can save many,1,
the service was disappointing the servers were in some hot mess  confused how to circulate the starters we were five members we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation we decided to take the buffet we were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints the sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard mismatching furniture probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement  which is not an issue for me the welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning had to remind them to serve one more only three plates were provided so after a wait of 5 minutes the rest two of us got our plates we told them almost 34 different staff members that two of us were opting for nonveg and three are vegetarian they would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 1015 mins we had to remind them to serve us more plus they kept bringing the same starter again and again despite telling us that there are other starters too for eg crispy corns arrived at our table  i lost the count how many times some starters arrived only once some veg starters were cold  almost after 45 mins the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived  main course was alright after spending an hour my appetite was already gone i still made a selection of prawn curry it was delicious i had it with naan and some rice as well desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it overall the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost mostly due to poor service,2,
meal box are value for money the tossed noodles are soft and much healthier than fried and chicken quality is also good the only con is that chicken is not spicy even after selecting the spicy option overall taste is good,4,
"taste was good though i ordered large the quantity was too little chicken quantity was very less

i ordered extra egg which is no where found",2,
very bad service no less than trickstersshould be sued for thisjust need opportunity for taking moneyevn after one minute of cancellation they are not refunding money,1,
have been ordering recently from here i find this place serves good quality food with proper packaging have ordered noodles and fried rice from here multiple times quality is good comes neatly packaged with spoons taste is good as well happy with the food here,4,
i have ordered few non veg combos from here couple of times they have good varieties of combo the taste of the good is average value for money,3,
"i was craving for some chinese food before exam day and ordered from asian meal box it was the first time i ordered from this place i could not believe when the food turn out to look the same it looked in pictures upload by them
i ordered gobi chilli and tossed noodles combomedium together with one gobi chilli extra
veggies overloaded in noodles and the sweetsour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding it is been 2years in gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles i have ever had here the garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable
medium combo is best for a hungry adult i do not know about mini combo as i did not order it
highly recommended place",5,
i have order pannier 65 with egg fried rice and one extra egg m paid for those but i am recived only pannier 65 with egg fried rice not recived egg but i am get bill from restarent include with extra egg,1,

"i got lose motions after eating veg fried rice with gobi manchurian
the taste was good but the hygene was shit must have been old food not freshly cooked",1,
one of the best gobi manchurians in the world thank you and keep up the quality always,5,
in spite of what some other reviewers seem to be feeling i pretty much liked what they sent i ordered a steamed ricechilli chicken combo and it was nice the chicken was delicious the rice could be a bit more steamed though overall not too bad,3,
food used to be good here  but these days they are putting lots of oil  taste is also not good so please bring the old taste and quality,2,
they have one of the most tastiest egg fried rice i have ever tried  it is like addictivethis was my recent favourite price wise affordable also quite worth the moneythey give both veg and non veg sides along with egg rice ultimately all sides tastes similarive tried almost all the food combos here everything was good go for it,4,
i ordred for noodles and gobhi less spicy but they sent me extra spicy it was for my five year old ended up ordering more food  waste of money and time,1,
"i will keep it simple i ordered food it was not good i ordered veg fried rice and chilli chicken i got triple black pepper fried rice sprinkled with some vegetables and dried up chilli chicken imagine you come home from a long day order some food so that you can just eat and go to bed but then this happens
i have had chinese food before i think i know what fried rice should taste like asian meal box i am sorry but my experience was disappointing never ordering again and definitely not recommending to anyone",1,
the food is good herei am looking forward to order more from here and the food is at reasonable price so anyone can afford it they deliver ur order in time,3,
i ordered chilli potato with fried rice box and i specifically mentioned the spicy box but maybe the restaurant does not know what does spicy means and u can also see that the color of rice is nearly equal to white it was totally waste of money chilli potato was even worst in this  i will suggest you to never order from this place,1,
disappointed crispy baby corn is completely soggy it was also tasteless first experience is horrible along with very poor portion size it can not even be enough for 1 person,1,
a perfect afternoon meal with 200350 calorie meal good amount of chicken also close to 1018gm protein it also has bell peppers which will help you have a rainbow diet the values are approx,4,
"food looked so yum but sadly i could have only two morsels because then i realized that my pure veg fried rice and paneer had scrambled egg remains in it not one whole egg so that i can at least remove it i am not repulsed by egg chicken would have been a different story of course but this was bits and pieces mixed in the rice and gravy no way to remove them

i would recommend this place to non vegetarians order veg and get non veg for the price of veg

vegetarians beware

i have just added the initial pic with the big piece the rest small pieces in the rice i did not have the patience to click or pick
never ordering from here ever again",1,
"waste of money  tried there vegetable noodle and chilli chicken gravy combo  noodle was tasteless  chilly chicken was hard and gravy was just average ",1,

"mini chinese cravings this is the place to order i ordered gobi manchurian with tossed noodles  veg hot and sour soup
 received it in well packed box which is sufficient for one foodie the soup was spiced fine and was delicious to order again same goes with noodles but would prefer to get some less black pepper next time 

while everything seemed and tasted good gobi manchurian missed the spot under impression of regular manchurian balls i ordered this meal box but got regular gobi dipped in manchurian sauce this spoiled the whole taste as at each bite you taste gobi instead of manchurian sauce a new way but not for me

foodance just warmed up for soup and noodles 
would prefer to rate 35 but no option for that",4,
too many veggies for a non veg box,3,
"very nice food and ambience
can get all types of veg and egg items in this restaurant good place to hang with friends and family and everyone",5,

the food was so salty couldnot eat it at all money wasted chicken was not properly cooked there was no salt in the chicken while the rice was full with salt no balance,1,
"we ordered chilly potato and chicken noodles both were disappointing the chilly potato tasted like raw potatoes being forcefully dipped in tomato sauce

the noodles were totally tasteless and we had to add spices to make it taste better worst of all it had no salt

not recommended",3,
this place has never disappointed me a goto restaurant at any timewhen you want to give some standard benchmark for a egg fried rice or its combo with any starterthis place will be on top of my mindonly negative is they have options for spicycurdy and which they will consider before cookingcan improve on this,3,
the rice is not well steamed and is hard did not expect this quality of rice to be delivered else chicken and the gravy was perfect and the sourness is just perfect,3,
ordered chilli baby corn fried rice and the food is delicious great food with multiple options i enjoyed the food quantity is decent,5,

"wow just wow what a let down i ordered potato 65 with egg noodles box
 spicy level  sour spicy and curdy extra  egg  quantity  large

ordered chilli paneer with egg fried rice combo paneer was good but egg fried rice taste is just okay remaining strarters gobi manchurain and baby corn manchurian are average they should improve in starters,3,

got different items than i ordered be careful before taking the order the guy is irresponsible not checking and delivering without seeing order,1,
ordered chilly paneer with fried rice which tasted really bad the quantity of the paneer was less and it was so dry the paneer and fried rice did not go well together the taste of the rice was more sour than expected and was difficult to complete it the package was not taped and the ketchup was missing for which i have paid highly disappointed with the service,2,
food is good but the service is not upto the mark my order was late by 15 mins so please try avoiding such inconveniences any further,4,

i ordered noodles with gobi manchuria trust me the noodles were so fat and without any taste the sauces or the fry that noodles went through there was no taste at all in it it was not even having the basic salt managed to eat with the gobi given in the box and later realized that there not more than 5 pieces of manchuria thus i could not even complete the noodles was not at all satisfied with the noodles combo box,2,

"vegetarian review
chinese cravings and i found this place to order i will now be a frequent customer of this chinese place because i loved my food i ordered paneer manchurian with tossed noodles after discount i got them for 120 bucks which is a decent amount to pay for a meal for one the quantity was not a lot but yes sufficient enough for one person

the noodles were perfectly cooked rightly chopped veggies in right amount right sauces perfectly sour i loved the noodles
the paneer manchurian was a little on the drier side to go with the noodles the paneer was a bit stiff too but the gravy was amazing

all in all it was a happy meal  must try
value for money  55",4,
"on an impulse i got my food delivered from here i ordered manchow soup which was quite good this was followed by a noodles bowl and a fried rice combo both of which were excellent the chicken was good the paneer was good
no complaints",4,
"the food has 0 taste the rice is not cooked properly the panner is very hard and chewy what kind of food is this why do they have 35 rating for this kind of food i want u to take immediate action ",1,
worst egg noodles i ever had please stop making such shit,1,
the paneer was bad in chilli paneer,2,
i ordered veg noodles but i get veg fried rice please be conscious while sending food to the customers,1,
had chilli paneer with fried rice box  i can absolutely say that this is one of the best chinese combo you can have  best combos at affordable prices in here up for grabs,4,
very oily,1,
imagine eating rice with dry fried potato i really do not understand how they serve rice with indian chinese chicken manchurian without a drop of gravy in it i mean did i order starters to eat with rice plus the chicken pieces were very few and cooked so much that the chicken was fibrous and dry btw who puts coriander leaves in fried rice people have raita and salan with biriyani why because just the rice and chicken is difficult to chew and swallow use some common sense guys,2,
good,4,
amazing food just loved the food first time order and it is just amazing one thing just that you can improve on is please provide spoons and folks for orders,5,
quantitity is very small and the taste is worst,1,
"i ordered veg manchow soup chili gobi noodles with panner 65
manchow soup is gud
chili gobi is worst atleast it is not boiled fully and tasteless
noodles was ok

over all i am very disappointed not suggesting please do not waste your money",1,
a little bland for my liking,3,
just ok ok,3,
i do not want to interest to eat this bloody itemi tell i replace my order can not listen it bloody zomato,1,
you charge for a sachet of sauce too  but do not bother to deliver it even if the user has paid the money for it,4,
dirty food,1,
"ordered 4 fried rice box
the rice was not cooked properly and was basically hard to eat
the panner in chilli panner rice box were very hard and the flavor did not get through the outer coat of ararot and cornflour
all four rice box were complete dry to eat the quantity of gravy was negligible or absent not asking to serve gravy for noodles but rice certainly needs a lil more grave

gave the 2 stars for neat packing and the timely delivery",2,
"work on saturday ah what can i say
ordered a medium chilly chicken egg noodles box from here
perfect combination to go with a lil oily but excellent quality of food quantity was perfect for one
will definitely order again happy dining yall",5,
the food was very bad the noodles was blant and the chicken was dry,2,
quantity was decent but the gravy was not well cooked and had a bad odour the egg fries rice were okay but the gravy was i believe a bit undercooked and hence spoiled the taste of the complete box,2,
less quantity,4,
give the correct item u idiots,1,
asian meal boc is best if u r looking for not too many option but a rice meal with a curry the taste of food is also too good my experience with asian meal box is good till now,5,
on time,4,
baby corn manchurian was gone bad when it was delivered,1,
"i just got a rice meal box which included ginger paneer on the side and the following were my observations
1 the rice was semi cooked it was not even boiled properly
2 the paneer portion was absolutely insufficient to complement the quantity of rice
3 the paneer tasted disgusting and it was absolutely dry though i had requested for some gravy
4 you guys charged me for the ketchup which was never found in the package
despite my horrible experience i am trying my best to be respectful about my feedback
if you guys have even a little bit of integrity kindly initiate a full refund on my meal i really regret giving you a chance to serve me and i will not repeat this mistake again",1,
avarage taste,3,
the taste is not good just waste of money wan refund,1,
worth the money,4,
"this place is a hiddengem

went to buy their sourdough breadended up having their mushroom soup death by chocolate cake and key lime tart

mushroom soup came with grilled sourdough everything was good about it the bread could be toasted with garlic butter

the bread itself we ended up using as garlic bread with our pasta at home which was really good the bread is something we will go again to buy

lime tart was better than expectation  the cream was way too much

death by chocolate was delicious rich chocolate was not able to finish in one go will have to get on it tomorrow again

highly recommend this place will go their again for there sandwichessourdough pizza and burger",4,
great selection of freshly made breads macaroons were well made breakfast here is a welcome change and worth the experience found all the items that i had were really good and freshstaff are very helpful and courteous they know what goes into making quality bakery stuff and stick to it,5,
visit this place for awesome bakery options tried pasta and toffee apple doughnut though pasta is not up to the mark apple doughnut balanced it out the ambiance is pretty cool,4,
amazing breakfast options also happy to find some authentic italian cuisine available here nice desserts as well the coffee here is amazing,4,
terrific experience amazing place for breakfastbrunch loved the sour dough bread hazelnut latte french toast pan cakes etc one tiny suggestion is for you guys to serve more chocolate and blueberry sauce with the pancakes loved the time spent here,5,
one of those little cafes that is as laid back as you want to be the cold coffees and ice teas are pretty good the ambience is pretty good too wish they had some board games or toys to keep little guests busy,5,
"i did not like the food at all  we ordered thin crust pizza quatro formagio and it was not thin crust at all with very bland taste on top of that  then we had the tuna salad which was too bitter to eat  could not even finish it  then we went for a very cheese pannini  another dish we could not finish  the bread was too thick to eat  overall huge disappointment for me ",2,
"food is amazing  had their english lamb panini  butter croissant and elderflower lemonade
ambience could be better 
servicestaff isare courteous
slightly expensive but definitely worth a visit for breakfast
their sour dough breads are good too",4,
"happened to try the breakfast option hereit is a good place to have english breakfastall the ingredients are cooked baked freshthe breads are really softwe ordered swiss muesliit was delicioushoweverthe portion served was too less for 300 bucksit was not sufficient for even a single personwe ordered baked spinach omelettewhich was fluffy and melted in mouthi have to say the taste was something i would wanna return here again forfrench toast served with maple syrup was also nicely made
taste is spot on and so is the ambience with comfy sofas
a bit expensive due to their natural flavours and self made products",4,
ordered tiramisu cup cake brownie green apple mojito and garlic bread unfortunately nothing was good grossly misled by high zomato rating wouldnt recommend this place even to my frenemies,1,
"eclat has the best cheesecake in town the blueberry topping on my cake was really fresh and delicious
their home baked breads are also a must try",5,
this is one of my regular hangout place it is a small and cosy place the ambience is decent and it has a see through kitchen the food served here is very hygienic you get to choose from a variety of options the vegetarian options are limited though i have tried their pasta  pizza  hummus  coffee  hot chocolate  cup cakes  gelatos and soup the taste of every item is good the food looks very appetizing and tastes delicious if you are searching for some cafe in gachibowli then do visit this place,4,
my all time favorite for bakery items and pizza beats european croissant any day try the butter croissant for breakfast do not miss the hot chocolate,5,
bakery items in the bread section are tasty croissants bagels etc muffins are dense in texture and the icing is overly sweet definitely can improve on those not recommended for strong coffee seekers if you want coffee coloured sweet milk beverages then you can give it a try,3,
food is really bad i ordered aglio olio pasta pesto veg sandwich quesadilla peach iced tea and broccoli sweet corn turnover starter the taste was really bad not even average they put tomatoes in everything and the bread was really hard i will never ever recommend this place to anyone,1,
"what a great find went for a late night snackingcoffee and the food service ambiance were amazing

we ordered basque chicken sandwich and very cheesy panini accompanies with an iced latte 

the chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside the bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw the whole meal is quite filling

the very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it it could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less 

both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass

service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play 

althought a bit on the pricier side the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread

"i was so glad when we shifted to our new house because it was so close to this place this is our favourite breakfast place on a lazy day especially when we are hungover the eggs benedict with salmon is my favourite our visit to cafe eclat is never complete without eating the amazing french toast do try it and you would cherish every single bite i hardly have pictures because as soon as the food arrives we just attack the one i have attached was taken to make my sister jealous ",5,
i ordered from this establishment many times in the past  and all the food was quite good  perhaps unlike anything in hyderabad  but today i wished to have the traditional fish  chips served in english and irish pubs in the uk and america  theirs is batter dipped unlike other sometimes more expensive places  and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided this is really hard  to get right in india in any case the result was a delicious facsimile,5,
"this place has one of the most amazing menu  great choices from pastaburgersbreakfast optionin house made desserts and customized gelato
 the most interesting part is that has an open viewing kitchen where we can see freshly prepared bakery itemstarts and macaroons which will leave you wanting for more  plus great hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staffi have been here for breakfast and had english paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte the quality of bread used is really one of the best

would love to visit this place again just to try the yummy spread of desserts and gelato",4,
"i had a real craving for a chocolate and ordered death by chocolate cake and quadruple swiss chocolate cookie
cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend tryingthough it is pretty small  death by chocolate cake was not fresh and had that sugary texture to it it was really disappointing",2,
"so i have been to this place with a couple of friends for breakfast so i would say that their bakery items are out of the world freshly baked and you can see the chefs preparing them through a transparent glass
breakfast was not great would give it a 25
they use their own recipes and sauces
also most importantly it is a big hole to your pocket very expensive so watch out",3,
"boy do i love their bakery products especially their fresh bread that whole wheat bread is to die for 170 bucks 3 times as expensive as one from old madras baking company but 3 times better in taste as well

they have a nice quiet small seating area which serves fresh continental and desserts i loved the quattro fromaggi as it was made from fresh sourdough bread

the only reason they lost a star is their high pricing on pastries 400 bucks for a cheesecake for example and average cafe latte but am a frequent customer here nonetheless some guilty pleasures of life",4,
"this place serves frozen food mostly they just reheat the food and give it you
liked the cinnamon roll over there
we ordered pasta and it was just fine
and yeah it is expensive",3,
heard a lot about this cafe from my friends in hyderabad located in gachibowli it is one pocket friendly continental cafe i tried pizza mexican buns sourdough bread sandwich cappuccino and a death by chocolate cake pretty cool stuff kitchen has a transparent facade makes it a little uncomfortable for the people sitting in right corner,4,
this place is near to my office it is on the same building of playstreet next to f45 and opp to plabo during my cousin is visit to india we used to visit this place for a coffee after dropping their kid at play school i would like to review about the cake which we ordered during my cousins birthday we are around 5 ordered gluten free options like chicken sandwich mango juice and a cake i completely forgot the name of the cake but it is the best ambience is good it is bit expensive,5,
i came here with my family last month we had a burger and taste is good and good place for family and friends and pleople can bring their children,4,
"just happened to be here today coffees are a try out caramel and hazelnut latte are good vanilla latte is average
coming to starters fish and chips can be tried out shepard is pie seems good but is costly chicken quiche is not good at all do not try
desserts are good specially croissants",3,
situated at one of the prime locations clat was an average experience ambience is good and service was decent guess they did not have many servers on that day the dessert we ordered was good but the chicken steak and burger were made of frozen chicken which was extremely chewy beverages were decent had heard a lot about the place but overall would rate it as just 3,3,
"this is quite a cute little cafe the food here is delicious although the prices could have been a tad less loved the french toast here had the chicken panini here the paninoli bread was quite hard
you can see your food being prepared here",4,
my favourite cafe around gachibowli a little overpriced but worth the taste and service tiramisu cupcake is a must try over here fresh baked breads are preservetive free and really fresh,5,
"staffs were polite
cafe is cute and small very cozy and comfy good for catching up with friends and date sort of
a little over price
could have better food menu",3,
"went there on a sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax  as you do in a cafe this review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance which is good as reviewed by numerous others but a different thing which bothered me once i started going through the menu  how expensive the place is i have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels but they are expensive because they are in 5 star hotels this place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400
taste  4 stars
value for money  2 star
overall  3 stars",3,
"extremely happy with the food it is the 5th time we have been there and the taste ambience and service is just great specifically srinath who practically runs it is too humble and hospitable great service food and ambience do not miss it ",5,
we ordered eggs benedict and american pancakes liked a lot both of them but they should also serve hash browns with the pancakes as the pancakes are small and the portion size was less the seats were uncomfortable they should have provided cushions in each chair as the seats are quite deep and it does not provides good back support but food was very nice highly recommended,4,
cafe eclat is a warm and cozy place which has quite a lot to offer for those who love dessert the raspberry jam donut was good but the chocolate ganache tart was not really upto the expectation when one tart costs rs 150 overall a good place to spend good time with friends for coffee but could be little over priced if the right item is not ordered,4,
"this place is located on the gachibowli highway

i loved the ambience food and service

everything we ordered was delicious it makes for an amazing breakfast brunch place

we ordered a chicken sausage roll english lamb panini and spanish omelette with hash browns
we also had a roasted pineapple yogurt smoothie

the sausage was lovely and i loved the dressing on the salad the meat in the panini was extremely well cooked

the smoothie had a zing and was very refreshing

i loved cafe eclat and i look forward to visit again to try the rest of the bakery items",5,

just happen to stop by this cafe on the roadsideamazing cafe at a prime location food is really tasty m coffee was amazing little overrated n over priced,4,
"this place has been a favourite since it started i remember the early days when it was building its repute one evening they were asking folks to try out their macaroons to get feedback over time they have established themselves as an authentic place for baked items
their croissant is quite good they are actually one of the few places i would trust ordering a croissant from they also make tarts and quiches their pasta is quite good even their cinnamon roll is lovely if you want good breads they have a good variety from sourdough to german rye",5,
i recommend their bread a bit on the expensive side but really good quality we bought their wholewheat raisins and walnut bread and were really impressed,4,
superb quality service and ambience can customise their dishes fresh bakery and healthy salad items just makes the best place for any kind of outing,5,
i had visited this place on a week day we ordered red sauce pasta and lemon drizzle it was good but the taste was not extraordinary i felt this place overly priced the cafe says that it uses all kind of organic veggies and cheese but i felt the price they were charging was exhorbant,3,
"perfect location for your english breakfast everything is baked on their own and you can actually feel the taste of itmust try the gelato of any flavour
scrambled eggs  too good to have
wafflesyum
potato wedges hot and crispy",4,
"i love their bakes cakes cupcakes croissants gelato and everything their cheesecake is heavenly especially with the in housemade tart strawberry sauce on top special kudos to the lemon cupcakes
i have never ordered anything savoury from them because of poor impulse control ",5,
"the only place to find best bagels or any bread for that matter they take food so seriously to deliver the best our kids love this place and want to go there every weekend
want to see more locations",5,
"excellent place to be and food is very hygiene and good
serving is very warm and nice
good place to hang out with family and friend is
a must visit place",5,
restricted to order just eggs due to diet plan the spanish omelette was very well made the selection on the menu looked tempting and the bread and dessert counter had a great variety to offer the coffee was good and service very efficient and warm,4,
"the best smoked salmon of hyderabad

order is  rating is

 smoked salmon croissant  455
 mushroom melt  45
 smoked salmon bagel  355
 prawn croissant  455
 swiss hot chocolate  355",5,
we ordered for a margarita pizza a brocollicorn puff a spinach corn sandwich a blueberry shake an icy latte and few cappuccinos  apart from the cappuccinos nothing else tasted good the bread was hard the puff was slathered with butter the icy latte was tasteless the food is extremely overpriced compared to the sub standard taste,2,
"as a compulsive dessert and bread hogger i was logically drawn towards the menu of this place and it did not disappoint

if you are looking for a doughnut please move away from those factory line produced dense overtly sweet and miserly filled ones it is about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid eclat is doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be the berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth

the new york cheesecake is one of the best i have had in terms of texture it is rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue i do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through

the chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city the key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet

the taste of the dishes confirms the use of good quality ingredients and an understanding of the technic needed to churn out great products keep it up",4,
a small hygiene place with comfortable seating the desserts and coffee are absolutely tasty  we tried the italian bread sandwich that was yum,4,
the food is good but not worth the huge price mexican bun  not good it had a strong coffee flavor and was also a little burnt coffee is average tables and cutlery need to be cleaner,2,
my wife loves the tiramisu here though priced higher than what i would have expected we also ordered a pizza which was good given they make it fresh and you can see the whole process if you take a seat at the back i liked the coffee strong,4,
"location prominently located just opposite to south india shopping mall

ambience simple yet funky designer interiors small yet comfortable sitting area good place for grab a coffee

food ordered there spcl thin crust pizza
which was really awesome 

death by chocolate its an awesome combination of choclate n cream which blow u away


overall a good place to hang out",4,
"we went in as a group and it is a small place and they had to arrange the tables awkwardly so it is definitely not a good place for groups

the food was below par the worst part was that the chicken starter they served was not cooked the mushroom toast was not good too the sandwich burger and pizza was also below average tasting they also did not have bottled water

only good thing was the friendly service",1,
cafe eclat has lot of variety and their white sauce pasta is delicious but majority of the food lacks taste french fries lack seasoning and sandwiches are dry moreover i find the place way expensive for the experience offered i would recommend to go here for cold coffee or chocolate shake,3,
"amezing place if you are looking for a relaxed time with some food and good coffee been there on saturday night the place is quite and well maintained staff is awesome with fast service tried some desserts along with sendwich and coffee  the taste was amezing
would say a must try place",4,
awesome breakfast placenice ambiancecozyonly downside is that it is very expensiveprizes could be a tad less service was quick,4,
"cafe eclat is a place where i can find best food in hyderabadone of my favorites are pizzas omeletsand tiramisui have problem with their settingeverytime i go the corner table is reservedthis time i waited for two hours on other tablei noticed that lady who was taking the bills had came and having food i do not know why this is happening with this good placethis was unexpectedover all ratting

we ordered a farmers omlette masala omlette american panacake banana ginger milkshake and a caramel coffee

farmers omlette was the best dish out of everything pancakes melt in the mouth and the combination of banana and ginger just works

i would love to come back to this place and recommend others to try out",5,

"update just wanted to make sure the cafe would know i am reverting my rating to a 1 coz your staff is issue with the payment caused me a ton of pain now to make a long story short you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card my account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once my card is blocked and i am pissed truly a nightmare experience all because i choose your establisment by mistake

old review
                         this place was on my bookmark list for a while and i was excited to visit it on saturday we ordered a mushroom quiche a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable paninithe mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price it was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that the pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright but its a whopping 500 rupees the grilled panini is pretty much the samei know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well i had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright but it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol",1,
ordered chocolate croissant for dessert but ut was horrible a cold soggy croissant was delivered which was too low in quality for 200 bucks  over priced and over hyped restaurant,2,
all time favorite place to crash where one need not think twice about your health getting damaged get the joy of genuine food without additives and preservatives amazing variety of breads and omelettes thanks eclat,5,
a must visit cafe with an amazing range of cakes and gelato they have a variety of breads to choose from along with coffee to opt the ambience and decor are top notch their service is good i will definitely visit again tho the prices of the cakes are slightly on the higher end,5,
this place has got the best cinammon rolls everything is freshly baked i like their butter croissant too coffee tastes ok sophisticated ambience,4,
really amazing place has vibrant and nice decor menu is really distinct and elaborate great people for people with sweet tooth for desserts even coffee is really great pasta is delectable too,5,
very interesting choice of food so far whatever i have tried from the cheese  tomato croissant pastries spaghetti pasta to the biscuits all have been top notch perhaps the quantity could be better but there is no doubting the quality,4,
enjoyed the mushroom  spinach sandwich felt that it could have had more flavours to it chicken pasta was also ok and the side bread tasted good liked their idea of serving water in colourful glass bottles location is amazing and ambience is nice being a small cozy place to enjoy quiet meals with your family  friends,3,
"menu here is very interesting and we went with lot of expectations 

for starters ordered  chicken broccoli melt and stuffed bell peppers 

chicken broccoli melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken broccoli and cheese on top the plate served to us is cold we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw luckily the chicken is not raw bread is very hard and difficult to eat overall not worth ordering 

stuffed bell peppers  tasted just ok but loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole 

aglio e olio  no complaints about this one tasted fine 

cabonara chicken pasta  so bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this 

quattro formaggi pizza  it is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good so much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad 

overall very bad experience which is forcing me to give a rating below 3",2,
very good italian food it has excellent ambience loved the english cottage cheese panini and pasta arbiatta the arfagatto dessert is amazing,4,
"a simple comfortable yet westernized setup which i highly recommend for morning brunch or evening snacking its a cool place to hangout with friends or partner it definately deserves 45 for the items they serve during these times of the day
recommendation 
1 sour dough bread if you are a real bread lover and other different variety of breads
2 eggsomlette meals pancakes are amazing if one is planning to go for breakfastbrunch
3 shakes  coffee also gives a goodie goodie feeling
4 sandwichesboth vegnonveg be it all kinds comes under safe options and they result to a good takeaway
5 peruvian grilled chicken  highly recommend
quiche  other small bites are also nice trials",5,
i ordered the bbq chicken panini from another delivery service and they gave me a normal sandwich with soggy bread and stale chewy chicken cooked in bad oil if this is what they call a panini they should probably shut down and take elementary cooking classes,1,
i love this placethey have an wide array of bagels croissants omelette it has prefect ambiencethat of a quaint english cafe it is sparsely crowded and my preferred place for leisurely sunday breakfast,5,
its a decent place to have breakfast but i would rather say vexpensive we ordered spanish omelette which was not value for money belgian waffles were amazing which made us happy but i would say an expensive place to hv breakfast,3,
nice cozy ambience good place to have coffee with friends good finger food however over priced chicken quiche tasted good however quantity was very small compared to price,2.5,
had ordered in for the night was really excited to see chilli con carne on the menu it is one of my fav dishes from when i had travelled had also ordered 2 croissant was disappointed with the look and tatse of the items for the price being charged the food had no flavour at all the croissant looked like some patty from a local store,2,
had heard a lot about this place but this is my worst experience in hyderabad ordered for chocolate elixir and it was big disappointment thankfully the staff agreed to change it the price for the quantity yey they serve is very highthe place was not clean there were so many flies not maintained and cleaned wouldnt recommend it to,1,
dont deliver from here cheesecake came as little almost the half of usual size of the one you get when dined and they dont cook properly and use good ingredients for online orders very disappointed not worth the money at all,1,
a posh cafe not recommended for studentsvisit only if its a treat but food served it great just a little costly the death by chocolate cake was an wonderful experience for me and also the carrot cake i loved it i had a white sauce based pasta too but i am sorry i do not remember the exact name it was really really good,4,
"as i entered i feel in love with the ambience  small but very well maintained place
service was quick and the food tasted average
but felt overall it is overpriced as the food is offered in less quantity",3,
i visited cafe eclat this morning for brunch despite the place being full the service was exceptional food tasted fresh and the ambience was lively would love to visit again,5,
"this has been a good find almond and au chocolate croissants were buttery light and delicious mushroom quiche though small was filled with umami served with caramelised onion their sandwiches use their own artisanal bread which gives great taste and texture i love that their bread pasta pizza base etc is all made inhouse with quality ingredients and no preservatives and artificial flavouring this is rare and so nice there is also some great looking fresh breads for sale we picked one up wrapped in paper

there may be room for improvement with the coffeemaybe stock some artisanal coffees from brands popping up in the country

overall i would recommend eclat over a lot of the generic socalled cafes people complaining about the price are better off visiting a cafe coffee day",4,
we went for breakfast to cafe eclat on a sunday morning we ordered spinach omelette belgian waffles coffee and gelato everything was delicious but over priced for the quantity especially the waffles overall it is a good place with happy vibes just a little overpriced and the portions are small,4,
i thought this place was extremely overpriced for the taste and portions very small portions and not so great taste could have been much better although the presentation was good,3,
"i loved the feel of the place as soon as i entered it though small but it is well maintained and gives you a cosy environment give the bakery items it specialises in the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from

the preparation is rich fresh and gives a good after feeling once you have eaten it i would specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth the almond croissant pain au chocolat are must try tomato and cheddar cheese croissant too is something that was different and relishing the hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and was not too sweet or bitter it was just apt

i would certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too but i would recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders do not usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation it is best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ",4,
"came here on a hectic monday
service was quick the croissants were neatly baked and the cake pretty great as well
i liked the part where they hand make and bake all their products one can see the kitchen area through the windows
the cake was neat as well and the coffee great
this place opens at 7 am hence making it a quick stop for breakfast and closes at 10 pm so makes it a great spot at all time 
prices are little on the higher side but it will all be worth it
will come here again for the great food",4,
they have listed themselves to feature on zomato but just decline every order terrible approach and poor customer service i am a regular at eclat but never expected them to be this poor,1,
"modified the rating after the second visit since there were no salads and there apple walnut danish had more raisins than apples  i was told that everything on their menu is out of season

the salads here are some of the best i have eaten in hyderabad unassuming place with great food especially bakery products their apple walnut danish pastry is entirely out of the world",3,
bit expensive but taste wise it is fabulous trust me order hot chocolate and pasta  all there coffees and food  are delicious looking forward to visit again thanks,4,
i really liked the ambience the blue cushions complimented the tables with wooden finish the glass doors added to the elegance the place was very calm i had the cheesecake here it literally melted in my mouth absolutely loved it one downside is that the place is a bit expensive,4,
"the first time i had something from cafe eclat was when we ordered snackboxes for a work event though a tad pricey everything in that box was fresh and delicious  especially the complimentary brownie they had added

we then went to to try out breakfast at this place they have all the items that make a good continental breakfast and also a variety of omelettes we ordered the omelette meal and the spinach and broccoli omelette we also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter everything arrived fresh and hot and tasted great in fact i am wondering how i let go of the belgian waffles on their menu the portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day

the next i visited was for a midnight dessert run and tried the rocher caramel  which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher much like your ferrero rocher only larger man that was huge and filled me up completely but was worth every penny 

so yes the place is definitely pricey but i have to say that they serve you the price is worth in taste and quality great place with many options so must try",4,
"went to this place couple of weeks back wasnt too hungry so thought of having some light snacks but seeing the price of pastry at 250  gst i decided against it when you add art to your tagline everything seem to be a bit more expensive i am sure the pastries must be out of the world but for that nice not my cup of tea

had butter and chocolate croissant which were good and had a chocolate drink with mint which was average 700 bucks for all this",1.5,
"the spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all fresh ingredients made us drool but we were in for huge disappointments
they have too vast a menu for them to handle nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh in fact the mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago
we ordered their selfrecommended peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces the plate had barely 2 bites of chicken but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken this at a cost of rs 280 was completely unreasonable for me
the chicken and mushroom soup was good but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago
coffee was ok pretty much standard as everywhere else
all in all hugely disappointed with the promises of fresh and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing",3,
"the place is near the gachibowli flyover
the ambience and decor is brilliant
i had tiramisu here it was good though i expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu 

you can make your own gelato in a jar here sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine

i went there on a wednesday evening and cafe was empty crowd must come on weekends i believe

prices are on the higher side but then again it is one of the best dessert shop in the area",4,
it is a little expensive place i feel coffee was normal nothing great about it but blueberry cheese cake was different and good if u visit the place then their cheese cake is a must try,3,
"went there for breakfast at 1o clock  but sad to see breakfast options being closed
but loved the other options there especially pain au chocolate et hazelnut",4,
portion size vs cost is dismal 3 inch diameter quiche costs rs165 packaging charges very very high rs15 for a paper bag size 55 by 7 my bill of 793 was inclusive of rs 50 packaging charges and rs 38 gst the entire order will not be sufficient to quell the hunger pangs of even one normal adult,1,
i have not tried their ala carte menu but had a slice of their cheesecake which was definitely not worth the whopping 410 bucks it was nothing like the original cheesecake and had a strong annoying scent of cinnamon moreover the portion was too meagre,1,
with the kind of price they have for the buffet i would call this as my worst buffet experience ever the vegetarian people i had accompanied had nothing to eat at all there was not even a single paneer starter and for nonvegetarians there was nothing except chicken being served  we do not expect such food for this cost and venue,1,
we went for a lunch with our team and all of us were truly disappointed with the food and the service as well for vegans they had just 2 starters the food did not had any taste it was more like just things being mixed without any skills desserts were little better but main course was completely disappointing be it the dal makhani which lacked consistency or the paneer which was like cubes poured on top of the gravy i certainly would have tasted better food than this at pretty lower costs,1,
ordered chicken biryani chicken chilli and cheesecake  chicken biryani was good but the cheese cake was beyond amazing it just melted in mouth,4,
where to start this place is really awesome especially their hospitality how the treat the diners is worth making a point and this place is best when visited on a sunday ambiance food pricing are all perfect you should never minis their desserts as you will not even have space for all the desserts in place we visited this place on our friend is birthday and they surprised us with cute little cakes and birthday wishes will soon visit this place again,5,
"went for lunch buffetlittle disappointed with the spread at this cost expect little more options taste was okay some of the items were good others were ok ok

i had the pleasure of having breakfast lunch and dinner here at various times for an entire week and i was simply amazed to experience an entirely different level of hospitality and customer delight at this place the staff ensure that they have a great connect with all the guests and cater to even the tiniest of the guests requirements i tried the alacarte menu as well as the buffet here and loved every bit of the food that was served chef chinmay panda chef abhay kumar sahoo and ms hema were the perfect hosts every time there was an instance when the chef inquired about our food preferences and specially prepared french toast and mind blowing idiappam for us once they knew that we were checking out from the hotel that day they specially got us a pastry with the words bon voyage engraved in chocolate on the serving dish they even took a photo with us for their archives i was completely overwhelmed by such a warm gesture and fabulous fabulous hospitality best of luck to the team at feast and hope you scale greater heights in maintaining such high level of customer service,5,
we visited for sunday dinner awful experiencefood was all cold without any tastethough staff was courteous and tried to compensate by good behaviour but all in vain when food is not good,1,
"as the name goes it is actually a feast to have starting with the food they have a lot of variety and everything is worth tasting at least the variety of salads is different and delicious the main course is really good and specially the dal makhani and all my rating goes to the desserts they are plenty and you can not get over each and every item definitely a place to over eat ",4,
"mahesh  hema are very good at service
should improve the spread
taste was okay
not great
expected a lot from sheraton but on the whole was fine",5,
"one of the best buffet i have ever had starting with the food there is so much variety and each and every thing was super yumm they had lip smacking main course items dal makhani is simply best
the best part is desserts there is so much variety  that you can not have it all and the greed for it will not satisfy
must try place though a little high on pocket
and the service is also good loved it",5,
"location it has a prime location being located in the heart of financial district beside the huge icici towers
hospitality could not have asked for better
ambiance perfect
food now comes the real part 
i went on a 10th of february 2019 and they were celebrating avengers then people in thor  captain america costumes with desserts all being prepared according to the theme gave us a cheerful theme to feast on the wide spread of the food with varied cuisines and live music just made my day chat corner serving pani puri and various types of chats fish poppers spaghetti biryani tikkas naan roti chicken curry and a long list of sumptuousness makes me go again 
frills so on that specific day there was a photographer who clicked everyone with the superheros and gave us a print of the same which was such a delight

thanks for making the experience special

ps it was all worth",5,
"the name itself is very famous through out and had a chance to visit this place and then belived why is it so famous through out

buffet is good though expensive great service and well spread food range decent ambience especially try out their sunday brunch or special buffets during festival time,4,
"standing true to its 5star ambience the food gels to fit in the category of a premium outing salads chat north indian continental to south indian this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category there was a huge section of salads out of which bacon salad being the pick of the lot the starters spread included hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight live chat and pasta counters tawa fish fish fry chicken starters pork pepperoni sauted mushrooms chicken salami bacon sausages etc  

the main course had chicken haleem which was okaish chicken biryani which was good mutton curry where i felt the pieces were undercooked mirchi ka salan veg biryani and some veg curries the main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters prawns and crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience the desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth they had a humungous spread of sweets which included chocolate burfi sandwich mud pudding motichoor laddu barfis moong dal halwa phirni fruit kheer etc the pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties overall a decent outing experience",4,

feast is one of the biggest spreads i saw in a buffet it has continental chinese and indian cuisine and chats with a huge variety the ambiance is decent but probably it could be improved

i would like first start with the desserts section there are many the very sight can be deadly to a diabetic patient perfect place for ppl with a sweet tooth a big selection of pastries cheese cakes along with many indian specialties

there was chicken fish and mutton for starters i could not see prawns chicken popcorn was so crispy on the outside and the chicken soft in the inside the best starter of all the other starters are okeyish

in the main course chciekn biryani and lal maas were the best overall a very good experience 

the on table service was slow the only thing i hope could have been a lot better",4,

tried the buffet here and was happy with the spread available the spread was a mix of india chinese and continental overall the food was good the desert options available were kinda limited but the stuff was good so no complaints,4,
"firstly the ambience is amazing i like the way the whole decor is simple yet endearing while the building is not impressive from the outside the set up is pretty good

coming to the food the spread was lavish especially the desserts were amazing and are definitely the highlight of the buffet however we ordered mocktails which were a disappointment further there were hardly any starters which was definitely something that we did not expect

the staff was cordial and quite helpful when we needed cutlery or help with a dish

overall definitely worth a visit",4,
it was pleasant surprise brunch interms of food huge variety desserts biggest in hyderabad interms of desserts and chef also so cooperative in need egg which where not there but he made it for us kudos,4,
"a reputable dinner at sheraton hotel known for their buffet and cheeese pesto naan if you havent heard of it yet then you must visit them 

a lovely pr and gluttonous chef turn every visit into a blissful meal

detailed review for the lunch buffet coming up soon",4,
have been here for the last two days and one more to gohonestly is feeling of home away from homethe personalised attention and warmth extended by the staff is amazinglike to specifically mention subhajit maity in the feast who has been a treat to be withlovely human and professional,5,
"yesterday as always i went out for family dinner we wanted to try something new my wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on google as i am sheraton marriot platinum member 42216744521791050313 and had the best experience in past i thought this would be a good choice we booked the table we started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection we opted to go with buffet there is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold not even warm i did not like the food much it was not even okay as you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from sheraton that was not the case here only realtime cooked food was hot like pasta roti anyway we finished our food and came back now in the night my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well the whole night he was vomiting and in the morning my wife stared do vomiting we rushed to the hospital continatal and the doctor clearly said it is food poising we went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team which may have caused the vomiting eldor son had pasta so he was good 
very disappointing experience from sheraton i have to think about my relation with sheraton in the future",1,
"a very good example of a very bad restaurant service 
sheraton was always on my top my list but feast  sheraton hyderabad has changed everything
to start with service is so bad here we had to beg for serving drinking water
the quality of food is ok and fish fry was stale
linen napkins on the table are not properly washed or might be used ones

to sum up the experience was terrible and not expected from sheraton unhappy",1,
"i dont even want to beg 1 star  today for dinner we visited this place and the food sounds pretty old which they were just keep on reheating inspite of many varities hardly it was worth my family got diarrhea i had to wake up till this late night to take care of kids who are suffered with diarrhea and all thanks to this disgusting restaurant

updating after 12 hours  now we all four members are down with diarrhea including me and keep vomiting feast tats really disgusting you guys are serving stale and contaminated food on this high cost hate to visit ur restaurant that was our last visit to this stale food restaurant looks all of your good reviews are paid reviews my bad i visited you on based of zoomato reviews if anyone think its a fake comment confirm with me on 9704669785",1,
went for the dinner buffetwas very disappointed with the service and food the service here is really bad no one is bothered to attend you or clean ur tablehave to remind 23 times for a single thing the food is okay taste is also okay  not somthing i expect form luxury hotel the desert section is good but not much variety cud have done better not worth ur money,2,
i went here for a team dinner we opted got buffet there is definitely a great variety on the menu but i did not like the food much it was just okay as you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from sheraton that was not the case here ambience is definitely 1010 maybe go for a la carte instead of buffet unfortunately i do not have any pictures,3,
it was a horrible experience food was okayish definitely not of 5star hotel standard the dinner buffet spread did not have variety place was overcrowded and the ambience was bland but the thing that spoiled our evening was their pathetic service and attitude there was almost zero attention to customers you go there and sit at the table and no one even comes and serves water or anything no one guides or provides instructions basically you are supposed to go and start serving yourself as if you are in some langar and not a high end restaurant even for the bill we had to go the counter and ask thrice definitely not a place to go with your special someone,1,
"the dining area is peaceful perfect place to have conversations over lunch hmm but if you are too hungry you can totally skip the conversations p 

various types of salads are available if you are a weight watcher or you are a conscious eater   i went mad over the hunan chicken it was just amazing peri peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it 

when i went the spread had a mix of chinese italian continental and south  north indian food 

the only thing that disappointed me was the mutton it was a bit undercooked it was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel

desert i feel they can do a lot more but i can vouch for the baked yogurt the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugarfree

staff are really cordial and are always with a smile on their face ",4,
lovely dinner  had a great time here we were served by nayan this evening who was quite polite enjoyed the food and service thoroughly,5,
"extremely happy with the service food and ambiance is great ankit the manager is superb

thanks for hosting us for dinner buffet and special mango juice",5,
"been here with a group of 35 people for food buffet
vert spacious dine area peaceful ambiance hotel staff greats you with smile good number of dishes lots of dessert options but no good ice creams flavors bengali sweets palak chat mango crumble fresh fruit cake are must try",4,
"with the name you definitely expect and hope a lot but when it comes to reality everything fails

i had a vegetarian buffet and the spread was limited there was no paneer in starters which is any vegetarians heart and when i asked if they can prepare with the huge cost of 1750 involved they could not

also the taste of other items is not upto the mark

the only good thing i can remember is aaloo tiki chaat

i would recommend you to plan somewhere even if it is a team dinner though mine was not

it is not even worth  500 and i am definitely not going to sheraton again",1,

went for christmas buffet lunch we were 4 of us the staff were very friendly courteous and cooperative 55 for the service but the food was very very disappointing the starters were unmentionable the chat counter palak chaat was good but kanji vada was pathetic in italian we asked him to serve us ravioli which was very hard and the worst we have had the saving grace was the indian counter the curries biryani bread etc were all good i think the restaurant should stick to indian and not venture into other cuisines till they are better prepared to do so,3,
"we were a group of 10 out on a team lunch we opted for a mix of veg and non veg buffet the spread right from the salads to the dips and the desserts was wide and each of the individual dishes were delectable do try the dal makhni and indian dessert options
this is a must try place and worth the money you pay for the experience",5,
"sheraton is one of the best hotels in hyderabad but their restaurant fails to match the expectations
i have come here twice for the buffet and the only good thing was some dessertsthey have very few options in vegetarian starterspizza is not of the best quality whole pasta is good
their desserts looks mindblowing but only few of them are actually very good

i visited flechazo on 13th for a team lunch honestly the place is really hyped starters were good main course average and the desserts were below average they have a live pasta counter but it was absolutely pathetic there was no seasoning just plain tasteless pasta and sauce even the mocktails are overpriced and average there are far better buffet places in hyderabad where you could get amazing food for nearly half the price would not recommend,2,
food was delicious and it has a large selection of food including asian indian and continental service was great viroopa was very professional and did a great job in assisting,5,
"this is my 2nd visit to sheraton first time i had dinner at link 2nd time i had dinner at feast restaurant i like the dal makhani it was very tasty

the food was good and tasty and the staff was friendly dharma from the serving staff took great efforts to make us comfortable dal makhani was a delight,5,
i am sorry to say this but nothing i mean nothing in this place was exceptionally good from food to taste to hygiene to the supporting staff to the ambience  nothing just made me food good and welcomed we were a group of people who went there and none of us were happy with the food or the food spread or the taste specially i remember nothing from what i ate as extraordinarily good i have been to westin buffet novotel buffet trident buffet avasa buffet and alllllll were way way better than this place there has been absolutely no work done on the ambience to look pretty or attractive it also was not that clear like other restau the place did not even smell good i would never visit this place,2,
very good and service from varsha and very good service overall they were so nice explaining local food variety and helped me choosing my meal,4,
i ordered paratha and kulchas from here yesterday night and out of 3 2 were burnt  taste was horrible  and when we complained in zomato chat they gave 27 credit points  as if that makes up for everything  our order was of much more value and then we had to order again from some place else coz no one will eat burnt food like that horrible service by being hungry and zomato  they do not take their customers seriously at all  will never ever order from this place again nor will my friends order from here again,1,
kaju biriyani is awesome one must try this for sure i love this most in this restaurantapart from this other items are also good i strongly recommend this restaurant near gachibowli,5,
this place is good for any food though the main highlight is the special biryani biryani lovers will happily go home tummy full also the chicken fried rice is a must try here,4,
pocket friendly place which delivers food quick service ordered the biryani from this place loved it served with raita they have a variety of options to choose from,4,
food is too spicy schezwan chicken fried rice that we cannot keep it in mouth had to throw all the food waste of money i think they kept chilli powder on top,1,
i ordered a veg panner biryani the taste was not satisfied and it was not good taste and the quality also low i am not satisfied with this quantity,1,
"ordered paneer masala curry and butter naan through zomato delivery was quick and packaging was perfect
paneer masala was little bit spicy and tasted ok paneer pieces in curry were less though butter naan was soft liked it
had also tried chicken biryani from this place taste was ok biryani rice was flavourful but the rice was little undercooked",3,
"pocket friendly sumptuous and decent quality

this place is my goto for late night deliveries their kaju biryani is a personal favorite

well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter this one is comfort at its best

their other options are good too and the helping is perfect for two",3,

the taste is absolutely very bad,1,
i was in hyderabad for around 3 years during that time i have visited this restaurant more than 50 times most of the time have ordered biryani and egg chilly dum biryani has been always my favorite here never disappointed,5,
the food was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation very pleasing especially the special biryani was awesome very friendly staff and owner too,5,
food color is more worst food which i ate in hyderabad unable to eatpaneer biriyani is full of food color mushroom 65 is also full of food color,1,
small outlet with amazing and tasty food every dish here has always been great my personal recommendation is being hungry special biryani lemon chicken chicken tikka chicken lollipop pocket friendly,4,
nice food value for money with spoons designed to eat perfectly grave and curd with onion is are well added simply super,4,
chilli potato and dal tadka is best at this place food is very spicy and tasty we regularly order food from this place good food at reasonable price,5,

very nice  well mannered,5,
i had ordered thrice from here and each time the chicken dum biryani was mindblowing superb taste and with two pieces of leg pieces most of the times it is total value for money but unfortunately i was going to order it again and see that they have removed that chicken dum biryani from the menu that is bad i really wish they put it again so that i can order it again,3,
awesome service,5,
i ordered chilly chicken and butter naan the butter naan was alright but the chicken needs to improve a lot although the gravy was fine the chicken was not upto the mark as it seemed tasteless to conclude it is okay but it really needs to improve a lot on a number of points,2,
ordered veg singapore rice while on work and it was really awesome with respect to quality and quantity this would be the signature dish of being hungry ordered based on the review given by friend and it is really worth,5,
the food was really great when i went with my office colleagues the staff was not much supportive and made us wait a long time but as per food the taste was great the paneer lababdar was great paneer chunks were soft the curry had all the flavours the butter naan that i ordered i must say  had too much butter but tasted great the special chicken biriyani my colleagues ordered was great also the staff were little on the edge but the food was really great,4,
worst order i ever had no chicken in butter chicken only a glimpse of tiny 4 5 pieces and a full of oil i will never order from this place,1,
very bad ordered special biryanibut it was mixed with dum biryani and completely dryif you guys dont have specific item please dont display in menu,1,
this place is quite close to our office but still instead of going me and my colleagues generally order from zomato i have tried a number of their dishes but the only one thing that stands out is their being hungry special chicken biryani my father has a restaurant in delhi and he ensures that whenever i am travelling to delhi i get that biryani for him from hyderabad so that is the level of love my family has for this biryani do try it out ps you guys may check out my instagram page for interesting food feeds simbassister,4,

the food was great the delivery guy also was so polite",5,
taste less biriyaninot following delivery instructions,1,
not cocked,1,
different base options available herepretty good ambiance to go with friends and it is very close to dlf  that is more than require to hang out here,5,
"i go to the onsite shop and have some shakes there they are too delicious 
i would rate there service as 455  food as 455  ambience as 455 
i very much like the idea of writing the reviews on the wall inside the shop itself",4,
this tempteys is just near dlf building i drank choco brownie its yum to drink its orea n brownie mixture and its around 189rsmy friend drank mango shake its having essence taste rather than mango taste and it is around 145rsi expected mangoes but no mangoes are their in that shake and its little disappointingthey write some note on the sticky notes and stick it to the wallthe ambience is good and enough space for parking too,3,
great shakesi tried marshmallow and mint oreo for the first time hereboth were pretty goodbut i would prefer the mint oreobut that is just mebest spot for shakes in the dlf areacheck it out,5,
"we have ordered from this place and it has some amazing choices we could choose from it has an option of gelato and avalanche for the base and i have choosen gelato

must try  premium forest berry shake caramel brownie shake peri peri fries

the shakes are super yummy and i had my best shakes here i will definitely try some more shakes",5,
awesome shakes make your own shake is the best where i can choose from variety of options which the shake should be made of the service is pretty fast you can write your feedbackreview on sticky notes and stick on the glass window and door,5,
nice and good quality but my details not mentioned,4,
ordered potato wedges and i found them very tasty and crispy served with salsa sauce and mayo althought i beleive that packaging can be improved a lot,3,
"drinks455 i think tempteys and mom rule the shakes world in terms of multiple outlets on hyderabad
look out for little appnearbuy for offers 
shakes are good chilly and refreshing
my personal favorite being oreo shake

ambience355 the place is cool can hangout and can have quality talk as it is mostly empty and most orders generally are take aways

one thing they should at least keep the tables clean there were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust

service45 they know their work prepare the shakes well one suggestion is to provide water to the customers as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys do not have water
wonder what u add in shakes",4,
after a very long time had one of the best shakes when compared with nearby thick shakes this is lot better to enjoy better taste and this makes feel that this is what the shake is meant to be like,4,
not that great taste it quality id say,2,
ordered a butterscotch thick shake for home delivery good consistency but too sweet to finish the full glass will definitely try other shakes,3,
"we went in at 1am and yet its open ordered custard maple shake crushed almonds shake choco brownie shake and potato wedges the shakes are categorized into premium and classic and each category has lots of flavors to choose from and the taste is amazing they have all flavors of premium chocolates like lindt toblerone to local chocolates of india the containers that shakes are given in could have been of better quality
there are only two snack items available french fries and potato wedges and i feel being such a franchise they should have added more options but the variety of toppings given makes good sense
overall i liked the quality of milk shakes",5,
"since i am not an ice cream lover still i ordered oreo brownie thick shake the shake was good enough need to improve packing while delivery
price  355

"perfect taste satisfied to the brim zomato delivery is super impressive ",5,
hey guys your resturant sucks big time if you guys cant deliver then put a big lock on your store but please dont cancel after 2 whole hrs after confirming the order in 5 minutes never gonna order ever and will advice same to others wish i could give a zero rating dont deserve to be 44,1,
i had ordered choco brownie shake and it was delicious the quantity and packaging were great and delivery was prompt as well gelato base goes well with the thickshakes,4,
"could not help but indulge my sweettooth in this store located in the dlf lane india is first to introduce gelato as base of their shakes you can choose your base between gelato or avalanche which is basically yogurt based icecream
new menu is interesting happy to see savoury items on the menu as well

tried coffee hazelnut shake  must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering just the right amount and was good it is loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips

caramel brownie shake now this is a stealer would give a 5 just for this probably the best caramel shake i ever had total yumminess even the colour is drool worthy a must try here yes the sugar content is high and too sweet some pampering for your sweet tooth

peri peri fries  how interesting is it to get options for your fries when you even love them as such i opted for peri peri spice and it tasted good and is for someone who really like their fries spicy

tried crushers passion fruit flavour which was okayish",4,
"definitely a good place for the milkshakes and some munchies

personally i liked choco coffee hut and crunchy almond feast and the milkshakes feel so good with french fries and potato wedges

service is so friendly and quick even the place feels so comfortable just go and grab a shake to get your self relaxed",5,
"great shakes are kind of a given when it comes to tempteys and this branch is no different delicious shakes tried the coffee hazelnut merry cherry and cheesecake flavours merry cherry was my favourite of the lot
what i did not expect were the amazing fries and wedges we absolutely cleaned the boxes out
service was also impeccable really quick",5,
"beside the radisson hotel lane is one of the best tempteys outlets i have been to i might have to get my sugar tooth removed after such sweetness overload

the service is fast even with constant incoming swiggy orders the staff managed to serve the ala carte customers quickly too

must have are the newly introduced forest berry milkshake and the choco coffee hut

definitely a good place to drop by for well made milkshakes and frieswedges in gachibowli area",5,
great place and ambience loved the varieties in shakes one of my personal favourites to choose from even the quality of shakes are very good order any time 10 10,5,
tempteys is better than every other milkshake brand,5,
"its a cozy place in gachibowli with the most awesome variety of milkshake and thickshakes
the best thing about them is that they use their own brand gelato ice cream which is particularly on the healthy side
had the pleasure of tasting the new menu a couple of days back
the poppy corn was a nice change of pace
the cookie caramel flavoured were my personal favorite
highly recommend this place to everyone",5,
"sunday afternoon we visited this place with the bunch of foodies to experience their new menu which has been added recently small outlet with around 15 people can be accommodated at a time

coming to the delicacy
classic shakes  poppy cherry and merry cherry were the two shakes which have tried poppy cherry was just like butter popcorn shake was decent merry cherry was simply outstanding and loved it
premium shakes  cruncy blue berry  caramel brownie were my favorites these are the must tried shakes at this place
exclusive shake  coffee hazlenut and cookie feast were delicious too cheesecake was decent nothing that great
crushers  orange bright poppy corn mint cucumber are some of the crushers which we tried but all were ok
fries  peri peri fries and cajun spice fries were really outstanding and loved it
potato wedges  this one was decent with jamaican dips

overall there new menu is quite a hit and have some amazing exclusive and premium shake which is not too heavy on the pocket and tasty at the same time as we were invited here by management for the new menu session but will visit again for sure in future to taste other shakes and delicacies

must try dish 
merry cherry
caramel brownie
cookie feast
peri peri fries",4,
"a sunday afternoon and desserts definitely makes an awesome combination added to which i had piri piri flavoured potato wedges and french fries all under one roof which makes temptys different from rest

i in a group of 8 landed this sunday afternoon to relish their newly added shakes and flavoured snacks

we were served with poppy corn  merry cherry as a part of their classic shakes caramel brownie crunchy blue  berry mint o fruit from their premium shakes coffee hazelnut  cookie feast from their exclusive shakes and minty cucumber poppycorn and blue and berry from their slush sections

the perfect shakes were poppy corn caramel brownie and crunchy blue  berry poppy corn just took my heartaway the perfect aroma of corn and it was an add on to this autumn caramel brownie will definitely be favourites to all the chocolate and brownie lovers honestly blue berry flavoured desserts have become my one of the favourite pick in desserts lately

these are must trial from here i have never come across any shake which such an amazing variety flavoured taste

the snacks behaves cherry on the top with piri piri flavour someone once said you eat food first with your eyes then with nose and finally you get to taste it these snacks surpasses everything the potato wedges and french fries were crispy and had the exemplary colour

"the caramel brownie was one of my favorites the taste of sweet caramel alongwith the brownies was a perfect combination when there is too much of sweet you definitely need some savory so we had some french fries although the sauce on top was not that great the fries were spicy and awesome 
read full post on thegastronomictalewordpresscom",4,
"tempteys recently revamped their menu and we got a chance to try the additions at their gachibowli outlet this outlet is a mere walking distance away from dlf and easily locatable in the building next to vijaya bank

all their shakes come with the options of 2 bases gelato icecream and avalanche yoghurt here is a list of the new ones and how they fared

poppy corn it looks quite plain but one sip and you will be amazed at the smoky flavour of popcorn hitting you from the sweet shake
merry cherry and crunchy forest berry are for those who love the berries
if you are a mint enthusiast do try the mint o fruit shake
for those who can not get enough of cookie shakes cookie feast comes in with oreo and little hearts stacked on the top
coffee addicts can try the very appealing coffee hazelnut which was absolutely a pretty sight too
my personal favourite though was caramel brownie the flavour of caramel with chewy chunks of brownie and a topping of whipped cream  heavenly
another good one was the cheese cake shake it felt like a fruit cake blended into a shake and is good if you enjoy that flavour
there is a whole set of flavours of slushies as well

just in case it gets too sweet they have french fries and potato wedges available in a total of 8 flavours they come in cute little boxes that you can probably carry away too we tried and absolutely loved the chilli garlic real white cheese and cajun spice flavours
at 89 bucks they are quite good to be honest
do give them a try whenever you are around

by invite",4,
"what i love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar so sugars do not kill the flavors expected in that shake

tried

poppy corn absolutely loved the flavor you could get a clear flavor of popcorns would recommend to try if you love popcorns

old granola honey loops again amazing one of the must tries

berry cherry good amount of berries great flavor recommended
caramel brownie this was also pretty good i am personally not a caramel flavor lover so not my fav

coffee hazel nut this was just wow must have for coffee lovers they were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake d it had a strong coffee flavor so if you are a true coffee lover you will like it 
cheesecake tuti fruity  it had exactly tuti fruity flavor did not like it much
oreo and little hearts cookie feast oreo shake never fails  it was good
blueberry slush i did not like the slush though it only seemed to have color but no taste

mint o fruit i do not like mint flavors at all and was ofc minty so not my fav if you like mint flavors it is for you

they have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing must try

cheers",4,
chocobrownie is definitely a must try,5,
"nice milkshakes but loosing its quality since the inception i feel artificial flavors dominate shakes good ambience nice staff

quality 25  quality was good but there was a plastic cover piece in my shake 
value for money  45

i tried almost every shake here  i liked the raspberry gelato base  mango moon shake  sithaphal flavoured shake oreo  lichi were average in taste i found a plastic cover in my shake while drinking  thats why 25 

i am a regular customer of tempteys and i will be  ",4,
this was the first time i ordered from tempteys looking at the reviews and their descriptions of food preparation i ordered choco brownie shake with choco chips as extra toppings but it was average in taste not that good what i expected so for me my first experience was average for the taste of the shake,3,
a cozy little place to chill out for young buddies sink into the lounge chairs with your favourite shakes creams and flavours  could be a delightful menu for kids as well,4,
"tempteys is one of the place i have visited quite regularly thanks to their nice service and long opening hours the variety on the thick shakes is amazing and the every next you try feels better then the previous i like the concept of putting sticky notes all around the walls with comments they received from the customers the song collection which they play in background has never disappointed me as well

i would really recommend banana strawberry shake out of all which has best ratio of sweetness and taste according to me",5,
"i have not got the quality what i payed for
not worth it
i have ordered lichi shake with risens addon but did not add any risens and lichi shake contain barely any lichi in it",1,
usually i order the same shake from this place it used to be so good today i felt that the whipped cream being added had very bad smell and taste could not finish even half of it,3,
i ordered the oreo shake and the ferrero rocher shake it was really thick and the taste was amazing keep up the good work i faced just one issue and that was the absence of a straw in my home delivery order which made it difficult for me to enjoy it more delightfully i insist the management to keep a check on this henceforth great shakes nevertheless,4,
nice interior with really good shakes its a good place to hangout with your friends price is quite high but the product is worth it staff is also very friendly,4,
good service and taste is good,5,
"one of my favourites this place is just amazing take any shake and you will not be disappointed
tempteys actually justifies it is name
i really hope the quality remains the same",5,
no cornflakes which i ordered specifically,1,
tempteys has never disappointed with its wide varities in milk shakes love its ambience tried mr cake fruitti which was a big thumbs up one should definitely try out this  will surely fall in love with this amazing milk shake also tried crunchy orange that did not meet my expectation crunchy almond feast is also a good one,4,
as usual the best shakes in the city,5,
agent was very good reached on time dil jeet liya,5,
"tempteys is my favourite place for shakes its a place which makes me little nostalgic as i have some very happy moments attached with this place just a glass of shake from tempteys and it automatically lifts my mood every shake has its flavour sometimes its so hard for me to settle on one and i just wish i cud drink them all name any and its there naughty nutella ferrerorocher  kitkat shake oreo shake toblerone choco brownie berry berry blast and what not the only word for this place is excellent and it speaks all  the only thing i wish from this place is that they lessen the cost a bit its a bit on the higher side ",5,
too sweet and artificial in taste,1,
extremely bad quality,1,
milkshake meltednot as excepted,1,
worst the employees who r doing this are taking out reputation of tempteys,1,
"great taste ",5,
it was not even a thick shake icecream was not present they put whipped cream in place of ice cream taste was bad,1,
"good delivery ",5,
it was delivered on time and got good servicethank you,5,
good and polite delivery man,5,
in love with tempteys,5,
why do not you consider instructions given by the customer i requested not to put whipping cream this is the 3rd time it happened and i never gave review earlier but this time really got frustrated please follow customers instructions,2,
delivery in rain,5,
extraordinary  fantastic  marvellous  best shake i have ever had a big thanks  hugs n kisses to tempteys,5,
pathetic taste,1,
good bhehave,5,
"a paradise for those who have a sweet tooth tempteys makes ice cream shakes so awesome that it sweeps you off your feet

although they have a bit of cramp seating space yet sometimes the wait is just worth they make really thick icecream shakes which are all worth trying naughty nuttela is a recommendation from my side

head there for a late night treat with your gang and you are sure to wrap up the day on a happy note",5,
bdhd,5,
delivery man was good knows the way exactly,5,
amazing,5,
bad packaging all the almond feasts had barely more than one almond each,2,

did not received order,1,
the oreo shake was a bit of a disappointment but the brownie shake as always lived up to expectations,4,
"this place is located close to the hotel radisson  5 minutes walk  where i was staying so i choose this place to meet a friend it has got a nice decor and the seating was very comfortable and relaxed we were the only customers inside this place during our one hour stay

i ordered a coffee latey shake rs169 and my friend ordered a coffee caramelo shake rs169 both the shakes were really nice and thick they are made with a blend of lots of ice cream caramel coffee and topped with whipping cream

on my second visit to this place i tried it is go guava shake rs145 and it is my favorite it tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with guava crush

epicureantalescom",4,
awssommmeeeee,5,
can do better,2,
their shakes are really good i tried the chocolate munchy stake if you like munch  perk in your shake you would like it the ambience is also pretty cool unlike other shake shops these guys have a lot of items on their menu,4,
i paid for extra choco chipsand i did not even find single chin insideit is so disgusting i have already mentioned in instructions likeplease do not forget add onsstll they forgot,1,
"ordered mango moon the taste should have been proportional it felt more like yoghurt and less mango
it is a problem with any avanlanche base shake from tempteys otherwise gelato base shakes have always been good",4,
i do not feel the taste of flavour that had ordered,2,
always awesome,5,
i got both same products,2,
just average ordered some 78 times they could definitely improve on the food quality they deliver food quality is always below average fast food is terrible here they do not know how to make fast foods pastries could be considered,2,
very good and had ultimate taste of the cake it was too good and my friend was so happy for her birthday cake which was so tasty and yummy the packing and quantity is also too good the delivery boy was also polite,5,
i had ordered 5 chicken tikka burger from ks bakes the burger was super sweet something one would not expect from a chicken tikka burger also the chicken was not cooked well and didint seem tikka pieces any way the bread was sweet and had a sweet fragrance to it i do not know if it is their speciality to serve sweet burgers but i did not liked it a bit it was my 1st burger order from k s bakes and i would not recommend anyone to order burgers from there not sure if it was a one off thing but all the burgers were sweet  quantity was good though,1,
i ordered veg samosas and egg puffs from this outlet samosa for some reason had kabuli chana in it although taste was fine egg puffs were stale and not so good in taste,3,

"i ordered paneer cheese pizza and veg boat from here both were pathetic they do not know how to make pizza
it was smelling bad and taste was really shitty plus there was no seasoning",1,

"i have visited several times for cake  here you will varieties of cake as well different kind size also  and test of the cake also awesome ",5,
"ks bakers stick to the tried and tested spread of options  pastries and quick snacks they have a wide variety of baked pastries and burgers along with cakes too

their space in gachibowli is quite roomy yet simple on the whole a must visit if you want to receive quick service and decent food",3,
"i really like this place for its pastries cakes and biscuits i see it a real competition to other bakery in the area my favourites are bournvita cookies and pastries and also choco almond pastery i would personally feel that their fast food or snacks could be improved in taste and the way it is served also i personally do not like it self service scheme here this does not mske you feel privileged as you feel when you are entering the shop also its announcement system is too bad makes you feel like on a railway station hence stars cut as these are part of ambience

overall the products are good and one can always try them prices are midway and therefore acceptable",4,
"quallity 55 they have a special taste a special cream which makes it better burger and sandwich are a must try
quantity 55 
ambience35 from there side they have arranged but i think because of rush  the tables would mostly be dirty other things are good
value for money 65 ofcourse it is a value that big burger with 50 rupees is a steal",5,
"ordered veg hot mexican pizza blueberry pastry butterscotch pastry from ks bakers
both the pastries were too good and coming to pizza it did not had much toppings even though taste was goodand all the items were very well packedreceived potato chips though not given in the orderseems like its complimentary",5,

their chocolate truffle cake is pretty good",3,
"ks bakers is the best place for getting or for etting pizza
they are providing the nice pizza 
they taste well and good so everyone can try that pizza is ",4,
"a new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets the lighting  ambience is warm  i love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs 35 bucks  a burger costs only 70 lot of university students depend on ks for a cheap dinner delivery you get free chips with everything you order 
but personally i felt the cheese they use is a bit weird  about sweet for the taste of a traditional pizza hut afficianado",3,
ks baker is is good for their burgers bread is very soft and prices are very reasonable cakes and cookies which is get here are great good place to go for the evening snacks,4,
ks bakers has several branches in hyderabad and i visited gachibowli branch it was good place to visit on weekends with friends or family and food was awesome i ordered several times from this bakers and every time the food was as expectedoverall food was tasty and it is budget friendly,5,
"i often visit this place it does offer good food and seating

the expense to satisfaction ratio is good one can always kill their hunger here without burning a hole in your pocket

amidst all the fancy food establishments with their over priced items ks bakers does stand out it offers good food at relatively low prices the place is never too crowded so one can always manage to find a seat on the first floor

i had their chicken pizza chocolate milkshake red velvet pastry and all varieties of their chicken burgers not one is disappointing all the items taste good i might specially praise their chicken cheese burger because that is my all time favorite
they have to improve in the milkshakes department",4,
"ordered their joy cake for my friend is birthday the cake was sufficient for a group of 78 people the flavour was really good for the price

the paneer tikka roll was nice and crispy on the outside but the paneer was very dry almost like rubber",2,
a week back i ordered a black forest cake from ks bakers gachibowli all excitement died after the first bite it was for the first time in my life after tasting black forest cake a zillion times before that i tasted a black forest cake with a strong lingering elachi flavour after reading a previous review mentioning this same issue i thought that the suggestion was taken and improvementchange would have been done i am sorry to say that the situation of the black forest cake remains the same i would recommend everyone not to try the black forest cake from ks bakers it is a true disappointment,1,

presentation looked lovely and the gum paste flowers on it just made our mouths to water the colour was sharp and had the perfect blend of black and white the presentation was superb 45

delivery got everything delivered on time nothing outstanding 355

cake now this is what was actually not good enough the black forest tasted much different than any other black forest

black forest cake a really huge cake for a good number of people it tasted exactly like elaichi and nowhere like black forest a damp squib 15

will i order from here again the cake was a turn off but i would like to give them another chance because of the reviews i have read",2,
i had heard a lot about their chain of bakeries and had tried there muffins before all were good so thought of trying their other bakes so i ordered a grilled chicken sandwich through swiggy and upon receiving the order i found it was grilled chocolate sandwich even bill was wrong raised a complaint and got a replacement this time i checked the bill which was correct but even then the item was wrong they sent veg instead the sandwiches were not bad1 star extra for that but i do not know how they can mess up like this,2,
nice pocket friendly place burgers and sandwiches are tasty and value for money the have a wide variety of different pastries the upper section is very nice to spend time chatting and munching,3.5,
a good place to hang out for a casual evening time the food items are good not too great and definitely not bad at all we tried the chicken grilled sandwich which was the best the paneer and chicken puff were not good the chicken thikka roll was good so except the puffs i feel rest all are great,4,
"loved the bakery and their innovative ticker system good food fresh and tasty

the ambience is a bit too old and seems a little unkempt scope for improvement for sure

definite recommendation",4.5,
i have ordered a cake suggested by mrrajesh flavour name mango passion fruit i have clearly mentioned that the occasion was very special guys after tasting it everyone liked the amazing taste of it including kids to adults i would really appreciate mr rajesh for the wonderful suggestionany occasion blindly go with k s bakers gachibowli vinayak nagar advice from mr rajesh,5,

"well all the time i have ordered here it has been veg corn burger and paneer cheese roll
they are too sweet to be considered as fast foods
the pastery i tried once was over moist do not know why but i guess the refrigerator was not working well

the have a really good value for money but i have seen that they do not make burgers and rolls at that time they simply defrost the frozen food in the microwave and put in some mayo and sauce and give it

quality 35
quantity 45
ambience 35 nothing extra ordinary
value for money 455",3.5,

then i got my orderaloo burger was good but paneer burger was horribleit was too spicy and only red chilly powder was dusted with mayonnaiseand mayo was too sweeti was not happy with service as they have numbers of chain in hyderabad then atlist they should maintain the quality",1.5,
"very impressed by the batman cake they delivered though i was never a fan of their stuffexcept the cookies but the cake was made with sheer perfection as you can see in the pic they very calmly listened to our requirements with a budget friendly deal whereas the other famous outlets denied for customized cakes and charged a lot happy customer ",4.5,
i ordered mini veg pizza manchuria veg hot dog  veg pizza bun machuria was good but it wasnt hot they just gave what was kept there veg pizza was kind of nice but it has to be more crispy veg pizza bun and filling inside was smelling worst as if its life span is over veg hot dog was bad it was having same filling as bun it was totally a bad experience and over that the ac was not at all working please improve the quality,1.5,
it is a good option but the bread they use for hot dogs and burgers is something which has to be improved burgers buns are too thick and the patty and filling at times is way too oily they have pretty good dining area too on the first floor the place is neat and service is pretty fast being an old brand catering to twin cities this place has always been a good option to grab some quick bites and lip smacking pastries,3.5,
our desi answer to the american mcdonalds and kfc value for money proposition and it is got the desi zing to it be it there chicken burger or tandoori chicken leg everything is worth a try,4,

over all a budget free and a nice place

"usually do not get a chance to go out for lunch on weekdays but finally got a chance with colleagues to do so after a client meeting since the meeting was in gachibowli we decided to try out a place not too far from ikea
so we landed at pourhouse7 which is located above the maruti showroom
for appetizers we started by ordering kung pao chicken spicy black pin chicken stir fried vegetables and also order a veg spring salad both the chicken appetizers were excellent the kung pao chicken was hot and spicy and the spicy black pin was a little sweet and sour and full of flavor the stir fried vegetables was made of a plethora of vegetables which included mushrooms broccoli zucchini baby corn and carrots
along with appetizers we ordered mocktails blue sea virgin mojito pinacolada and ph7 is special in house mocktail among the mocktails the one which stood out was the special in house drink
coming to main course we ordered paneer butter masala butter chicken and rotis the butter chicken was delicious chicken was tender buttery and cooked perfectly paneer was soft and fresh
the best dish of our lunch was the 7h special biryani wrapped in an omelette the biryani was visually appealing the rice was flavorful chicken full of spices and this biryani was amazing
overall we had a fantastic time if anyone is around gachibowli and looking for a drink and good food this is the place to visit",5,
"pour house 7 is very easy to locate as it is around half a kilometre away from ikea it is on the fourth floor if the building

ambience 
it gives you best of both worlds it has rooftop seatings and an air conditioned seating the ambience is very sassy it is surely a party place

food 

mocktails
i tried flavoured mojito virgin mojito ph7 special mojito pina colada and sweet sunrise all the mocktails were flavourful beautiful and refreshing my personal favourite was sweet sunrise

starters and salad
i tried kung pao chicken crispy corn stir fried vegetables veg spring salad and spicy black pin

kung pao chicken the chicken was well cooked and most importantly it was not bland the spices were just right for a person like me who prefers spicy food the dish also included honey so it tasted slightly sweet which took the dish on another level  definitely a must try

spicy black pin it was kinda similar to kung pao chicken but was grilled and was not sweet it tasted nice

crispy corn it was sweet and crispy presentation was on point 

stir fried vegetables the vegetables were cooked properly and the spices were complimenting the vegetables

veg spring salad it was very tasty and healthy the coating of the salad was bringing the best taste of the veggies

main course
i tried chicken alfredo pasta sicilian pizza paneer tikka masala naan butter chicken and 7h biryani

chicken alfredo pasta it was creamy and absolutely delicious the chicken was very well cooked loved it

sicilian pizza it was loaded with veggies and the amount of cheese was okay i am not a  too much cheese person so it tasted good also you can ask the staff to put more cheese

paneer tikka masala it was spicy and flavourful the paneer was soft and tender very well made 

butter chicken the chicken was tender and juicy the gravy was very rich loved it

naan perfectly made

7h biryani it had lip smacking flavours the presentation was on a whole new level it was enclosed in omelette the chicken was flavourful and the basmati rice and tender and tasty highly recommended

all in all 55

pour house 7 is definitely my go to place now ",5,
"so this place is located near ikea above the maruti showroom gachibowli been to pour house 7 two days ago was really good it is an excellent place for party lovers  foodies i had the best time the ambience where it has both indoor and roof top seating and loved the rooftop seating started off with it is delicious mocktails like mojitopina coladasunrise
my personal favorite was definitely pina colada and how can i not mention their mouth water biryani and kung pao chicken the kung pao chicken it is so flavor full at first you will taste the garlic  then a hit of sweetness because of it is honey i definitely recommend it to people
i have watched one of the best sunsets of my life from their rooftop i am a sucker for good food  good view loved every bit of that place
its a must visit when you are in hyderabad

ambience55
food drinks 55
service and staff55",5,
good place did not really like the dj music but it is better than a few other places in and around gachibowli ladies night a big plus to check out food was good open area so the environment is not that great during summers,4,
it is good place to visit pradhan was serving us he was polite and friendly had a good time like to visit again at night for checking out,5,
"here is my review

location
very easy to locate it is very near to ikea a prominent landmark in hyderabad its on the 4th floor also rooftop option is available in the evening time 

ambience 

once you enter the pub the interior will blow you away the unique point about ph7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of gachibowli and highrise buildings around

food 
i tried lot many things here  here is the detailed review of every item

mocktails

ph7 special mocktail it literally holds the name the most colorful mojito i ever came across the flavors will tickle your taste buds

blue sea its so beautiful to look at the blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers

pina colada you might wanna skip this one i found the flavors not complementing each other

flavored virgin mojito  most recommended drink for hot summers refreshing minty and relaxing 

salads
stir fried vegetables the main thing about the salads is its seasoning the taste of the cooked veggies was so good they could go a bit less on the oil though

veg spring salad it gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty

main

butter paneer  roti i prefer paneer curries to be spicy and buttery and no doubt they nail it its pretty heavy i was almost done with 2 rotis

sicilian pizza  the pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings cheese was a bit less you can mention to add more cheese to make it better it was okay overall

crispy corn  the presentation of the dish was unique and catchy the taste was anyway a bit different from my liking as i prefer it salty n spicy and not sweet could be my own preference you can still try it out

overall
pour house 7 is the goto spot if you are around gachibowli and are hungerstuck i would surely recommend this place do try out in the nighttime and enjoy the rooftop ",5,
"crazy place guysvery small and middle of non residential area and top of a residential place

one of the peaceful places to hangout with friends open terrace and the staff is amazing food is good too hope you come and visit this place,5,
a decent place for party and a cozy climate too veg manchurian was great and chicken kebabs were fine first thing that disappoints me is there is no drought beer and the most annoying thing was the behaviour of the manager akthar there has to be some respect towards the guests and the managers was bossing everyone around i am giving this a two star only coz of him else i would have given a 4 maybe if i had the drought beers,2,
nice food and drinks maybe they can add some more to the menu it was ladies night the day i went enjoyed very friendly crowd suddenly we all made a big group and danced our hearts out cheerful comfy place would go there again,4,
"been to this place recently along with few of my friends for lunch and we had a good experience the food was delicious  only reason to give 4 star rating  but the staff were so neglected to us  at our time of visit 
the whole review will be updated soon ",4,
"place is not so appealing as we went in afternoon and no one was there at this place

there was dust all over the place as some construction work is going on

food is ok

ambience poor

reachability ok

overall experience 255",3,
"do not have zero rate here one i m giving bcoz they welcomed me nice way but food was sucks here we had three starters which were not good at all chicken starter was smelling may be they use stock or stale chic not come again here very bad experience total wasting of money 
",1,
"super ambience at rooftop 
amazing food worth the price
dj was nice but ipl took all the attention and so no one danced 
this time overall experience was ok ok i hope its better on my next visit",3,
been here on a thursday afternoon the place is very different from the pics indoor seating is congested and uncomfortable starters in the happy hours can be improved service is good,3,
ambiance was superb of ph7 specially the roof topdj was good and the drinks and food were up to the marksubhash was the guy who served us very wellif you are thinking of a good ambiance place with good food and drinks then should visit this place for surewe are gonna come back very soon,4,

cool place with amazing food and drinks of happy hours menu loved the place specially the roof topservice was good and they treatred us very wellthank you pour house 7will come again very soon,5,
"we visited this place today a decent rooftop place with good ambience ipl screening okayish food and dj the service is a tad bit slow giving a resemblance of a place not visited often though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season the place bore a deserted look
dj was good and adapted according to the crowd
we started off with butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn both of them turned out to be very oily we further ordered fish tikka which was okayish masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change they wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne
if you are in a group and want a place not heavy on ur pocket can opt for pourhouse7",3,
i visited this place on friday with my friendsthe roof top view was awesome and loved the food and drinks toothe staffs were very politewill visit again very soon,5,
average ambience  average food and average experience not worth the 500 bucks they charged for entry as cover which was not even adjusted with the bill music was too loud making it difficult to sit through a number of items on the menu were unavailable though service was prompt had high hopes because of the zomato rating but was thoroughly disappointed should give it a miss if one is looking for a classier experience,2,
"one star only because zero star is not an option
probably one of the worst and slow place in hyderabad
only one bartenderwaiter who was not even in the bar for most of the time",1,
walked in during happy hour and was shocked to know they had very few drinks available and out of beers and when asked the service staff had no clue all they said was no stock it may take an hour or more sad,1,

overall my experience pourhouse7 was really amazing thanks to the staff for offering great hospitality",5,
"i chose this place because a friend of mine recommended and i was pretty disappointed with the sluggish service as it was not even standard
there was just one bartender on a friday night which really escalated the waiting time service on the food section was even slower as the fries ordered at 9pm were served at 10pm i was extremely displeased
if you want visit pourhouse7 then i would suggest going only for dancing and that too only if you can tolerate the high base",3,
"place looked good when entering but that was it it went downhill from there it took three people from their staff one after the other to confirm what we had ordered and it was only one dish we had to wait for 2530 minutes for the order only to realise they had served it to somebody else this was when there were only 5 tables occupied the staff seemed inexperienced
the toilet is location is just bad whenever somebody opens the toilet door the whole place stinks up like piss
we just gave up on the place and left paying for the drinks that they had managed to serve
the owners and managers really need to look into the problems",2,
"pourhouse7 is a spacious roof top bar that offers great ambience paranomic views of the cityscape and prompt friendly service
everything is in our budget

food i was here with my friends the other day for lunch and we tried the following
appetizers
 tandoori malai broccoli broccoli are marinated in cheese  cashew paste and cooked in a tandoor it was scrumptious  45 

 crispy chapa fish fillets are marinated in indian masala and deep fried to perfection it was topped with fried curry leaves and chillies must try  55 

 chicken nachos tortilla chips topped with pieces of chicken red beans corn and other veggies were delish you guys another favourite  45 

 fish fingers fish fillets cut into strips are coated with bread crumbs and deep fried they were so crispy from the outside and tender from the inside it came along with french fries and mayonnaise  55 

 moroccan chicken sticks grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and other spices they were smoky and appetizing  45 

 jhinga nasheela prawns marinated in indian masala and grilled it was crispy and medium spiced  35 

 bruschetta slices of sandwich bread are topped with veggies  cheese and baked they were seasoned with red chilli flakes honestly it was not even bruschetta in the first place give it a miss  25 

main course
 7h special chicken biryani basmati rice cooked along with pieces of chicken marinated in indian masala the entire dish was covered with an omelette that was topped with fried onions it was truly unique in terms of both taste and presentation highly recommend the biryani  55 

 spaghetti aglio e olio veg  spaghetti tossed in olive oil along with black olives garlic and chilli flakes it was appetizing  45 

 great nawabi pizza pizza topped with chicken tikka veggies and mayo although the toppings were generous and spicy the base of the pizza was a serious let down it was hard  35 

 alishaan chicken sw pieces of chicken lettuce and other veggies along with mayo are sandwiched between two grilled breads served along with fries and salad it was just okayish  35 

drinks
so we tried a few mocktails about 5  and honestly they were bad the only saviour was virgin mojito

the staff are polite and friendly
vfm 45 service 45",4,
"went to this place a couple of weeks back owing to the buzz in the city about this place
we started off with haryali paneer tikka whixh was extremely tender and juicy
the other vegetarian delicacies we had were chilly paneer and bhutte de kebab  loved the kebab unexpectedly recommending that kebab
butter garlic fish was something differently exquisite it was topped with gravy and when you eat a piece it was crunchy its very tough to do thatkudos to the chef
nazakhat kebab and mutton mazedaar were kind of favourites because of their awesome taste
for maincourse we had the 7 h biryani it was delicious biryani full of chicken and masala covered totally by an omelet topping
the crispy onion rings and its special sauce were the showstoppers of the day totally loved it
for desserts we had the caramelized brownie with ice cream
highly recommend this place to everybody",5,
"one of the beautiful rooftop party places in gachibowli and in the vicinity of hitech city

been here last weekend and tasted some of the sig ature delicacies

rooftop had a beautiful ambiance and a beautiful skyline view of high rise buildings in the surrounding

started off with some exotic colourful mocktails mocktails tasted good but they lacked that fizz informed the same to the manager who was polite to take it as a feedback chocotina shake was superbbbb

starters which i really liked were 7 house crispy fish chicken majestic and paneer ke sholay

fish was juicy and crispy on the outside and tasted so good with the spices that were coated

there was this burj khalifa onion rings appetizer which was innovative and was best with the sauce that it came with

they have special biryani in their maincourse which was worth having

great nawabi pizza was with trying alsononveg pasta in white sauce

choco brownie with vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun with vanilla icecream were in the desserts

overall it was a good experience place offers corporate lunch and dinner packages good option for people who are looking for corporate parties lunch and dinner",4,
"today i visited this place called pour house 7 in gachibowlithe place has indoors as well as rooftop seatingthe rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well litthe indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groupscoming to the food it was really mind blowingwe tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted greatlets have a look at the items we tried starting from mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts
firstly we had tandoori malai broccoli which literally surprised mewho had thought broccoli could be that tastyit tasted amazing with a creamy taste to itnext we had crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavourthis was an outstanding dish and all of us loved itmorrocan chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty goodthe chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on topthe chicken was nice tender and juicy tooi love seafood and so i ended up ordering a jhinga nasheelathis tasted good but nothing extraordinary about itit was just good that is itwe also had chicken nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoningloved itwe also had a bruschetta which was averagealong with these we also ordered aalishaan chicken sandwich which i would say was not at all aalishaanthis was not goodit lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tastynext we had a nawabi chicken pizza and it was really goodthe topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its basethe pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but i still had it because of the amazing toppingwe had a platter of fish fingers and fries and it was excellentboth the fish fingers and the fries were good
after devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the special 7h biriyani and spaghetti aglioeolioi am in love with their biriyaniit was not like any other biriyani that i have ever tasted beforeit was unique and it was excellent tooit has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in hyderabad and i could not guess what is the secret ingredient wasthe spaghetti i would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites
now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and gulab jamunsi would say the dessert section does not provide for much choicesthe jamuna were decent
we also had some moctails in between which were not up to the markthey need to improve their moctailsthe only one i felt was perfect was the virgin mojitoother mocktails we had were not goodwe had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured onebut we did not like these much

overall i would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also greatthe drinks need immense improvementthats it folksthis was my review of the placehope you like it",5,
such a pathetic service no one will attend you you have to ask themnice place but service will annoy youhave to think before comingfirst time bad experience,1,
"march 15th  had to change my rating to 1 today the worst service ever my table is right across the bar and no one cared to take an order till half an hour the staff does not know a thing about service tables are unclean and stick as usual the stupid dj is soo loud but it got better later poor maintainince of the place adds to everything i literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order waiter is so absent minded imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins
the poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place there was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing it was a really pathetic experience and i would definitely choose a different place next time

special mention to dharmender who was very attentive
i have not tasted much of their menu but the white sauce penne pasta was average i expected it to be more flavorful and have consistent creamy texture but it wasnt the chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks the only thing i liked about the place was that it stocked kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places the seating could be arranged better seats werent that comfortable and i keep hurting my knees everytime i make a move the musicdj was exceptionally loud and not pleasant at all  if you can please get the dj to reduce the volume at least during peak dinner hours i could not hear anything my colleagues sitting across the table were speaking",1,
the greek pizza was totally not worth rest was very goodtaste of cheese fries and mushroom was bestprices were too high which was not worth in many other dishes as well,3,
good rooftop location however ambience not set properly average service uninterested service managers disappointing that it is going down with time limited product availability mostly you do not get the product that you want to order and they give very limited choice,3,
i visited this place along with my friends today the food at this place was really good the ambience was good the service was fine i will update a detailed review of this place as soon as possible,5,

"a place to hangout with friends this place is good for night life they have the best view from the roof top area
we visited this place for dinner the weather was freezing cold i was craving some hot soup
we ordered chicken manchow soup and lemon coriander soup the soups were perfect for a freezing cold evening
comming to the mocktails the virgin colada chatpata madness and sex on the beach were very soothing
starters were delicious we had
hyderabadi tawa fish which was so much flavourful
lahsuni paneer tikka was so smooth and melting in mouth
tandoori broccoli was my favourite from this place
main course was really gud
finishing with the desserts the hot chocolate brownie with ice cream was too tempting and sweet
overall a great experience surely must visit this place for ambience and their starters loved this place and the view",4,
"at gachibowli we have a new rooftop dining place which captures the astonishing view of hyderabad is new side overlooking the mighty ikea we dined at pourhouse7 where they house a club too at the floor below the rooftop

it was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on but on a regular evening the place would be warm they have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala

the starters were not that great and needs much improvement they had chicken manchow soup and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place will not be expecting much orders on them as it is a bar the hyderabadi tawa fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night in the vegetarian department i will recommend tandoori broccoli 

further to the main course the tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs the masalas of cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty they were an amazing combination with the rotis the place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of

for main course we orderd
butter naan  it was way too thin and oily
murg cashew nut  tasted good
for dessert we had
 brownie  the sides were too crispy could have tasted better

overall i think there is room for a lot of improvement in their food and ambience the music can also be better hope they will take it as constructive feedback and work at it ",3,

its not only a club it is an other party world",5,
went to attend the nucleya concert may 2019 it was very very crowded but the ambience is great the interior design is definitely one of its kind good place to party with friends the security is nice since it was a crowded evening the only thing we ordered was a pizza which was okayish,5,
this place is lit i totally enjoyed everything from service to set up to light sound and the magical paper bursting thing they do towards the end given the current trend of clubs in hyd i do not find the place expensive the waiters and bouncers were friendly even on a busy night with zaedan performing and took great care,5,
"well well well
this is the most happening place in the hyderabad right now
ambience as too good a great place to dance
i was there at this place for mc sher siddharth chaturvedi event i really witnessed craziest crowd in hyd the event was really spectacular
would love to go to this place again
full pashaa log because it is posh place 
only minus here is price",5,
i had visited this place for the nucleya event it was super crowded v did not even have place to stand since it was very crowded the service was delayed too overall the place is nice just the crowd was an issue,4,
"well to start of with i was there for nucleya event the place is just awesome and in hyderabad at first it was hard to find a proper club and then prism happened great team who managed more than 3k people that night

loved the place and loved the music amazing djs great food and drinks not very expensive ambience is worth experiencing the sound lights and the special effects was one of the best i have experienced i have partied in many places in mumbai however this place took it to the next level,5,
"the reception was quite disappointing we came at around 7 we were asked to come in an hour confirming that stag entry was allowed for a certain fee

later at 9 we were just denied entry becaue apptetnyl everybody at the reception had quite an attitude and trip of their own

the most disappointing experiences in hyd",1,
believe me pls dont go to this pathetic place in hyd i have been in many pubs in hyd but this is beyond worst they do not know how to manage a huge crowd plus do not provide good service  plus there is network issues so you cannot pay through your card and they will force you to pay cash,1,
"this place a great feel to it 
very vibrant and loud
good to have a pool party at this time of the year
amazing place to party
hoping to visit soon",3,
great place the setup is truly one of its kind but the staff and the entitled crowd will spoil the experience completely for you absolutely pathetic hospitality they lack even the basic human courtesy lusty uncles and snobby bouncers is all they have in their crew,1,
fabulous place really enjoyed my time here good food good cocktails trippy lights make for am amazing ambience peppy music the only cons are that it is a bit pricey and the dj does not play hindi songs do not judge me please p loved it must visit,5,
amazing club great lighting and house dj is fantastic great food special mention to parida our server for the excellent service must visit place for all party animals,5,
vijay is very friendly and makes sure u get ur drinks on time it is a must visit place especially vijay is service i would really recommend all to try this ones,5,
"prism the most happening place right now in hyderabad
huge dance floor to let go n dance your heart out
amazing lighting and the vibes at this place is just mindblowing 
not a place for socializingarena for partying hard",5,
this place was just out of this world they use the entire digital capacity of the place to blow your mind the in house dj is just unbelievable the beats will get you bouncing on your feet we had gone for ritviz is show which was a super duper hit they have a really cool outdoor space as well food is amazing tried the non veg farm pizza and burmese rolls crowd is a bit mixed  college kids kinda 30s 40s and 50s as well the ambiance and the music just covers up for any flaws if any,5,
"fantastic place for an eventawesome servicespecial shout to vijay prism for taking good care of us definitely goin back
great vibes",5,
the place is amazingfriendly place to hangoutfood and drinks is super employees are amazing specially met santosh a nice mannered guy with decent lookhis way of service is super,5,
"amazing place with good food music and ambience
really good service provided by sarooj and praveen
a really nice place to kick start your weekend",4.5,
too much attitude display by all staff need to be taught manners regarding how to be courteous to guests only ambience food just about ok,1,
"after hearing a lot about this place i got a chance to finally visit this as once reaction was wow but that went away pretty soon
right from the entry there was a confusion we did a booking through dine out for 830 pm which did not really make sense as the table were not blocked to figure this out we have to wait for 20 mins for the manager to come when asked about the reservation manager was totally rude and said to my wife that she should be happy that she got a table i mean wow it was an eye opener for us
and at that point i realised this is one of the mostly badly managed places

no doubt its huge with good lighting  ambience and dance floor but the service is pathetic
the food is average and costly nothing great in drinks prices are all on a higher side 
we just got a drink and a platter and left to a much better managed and a calm place

there is no point making such a huge place if you cant manage and talk to customers nicely not really sure if i would like to visit this place again even though its a hot property right nownow really sure why",1,
definitely one of the biggest clubs in hyderabad lightning is good music is good as well i guess food can be improved more slightly heavy on pocket side but definitely worth it,4,
"this place is certainly one of my favourites in hyderabad went there on a friday night and the place was just amazing the huge dance floor with the amazing lights set up is the best part about the place the dj and great crowd were like a cherry on the icing
the food was good too so were the drinks this place is definitely a must visit if you are a party person",5,
okay now prism got the attention of hyderabad one of the best club now a days the ambiance is crazy dope they swirling light moves with music and trust me it gets you the food is good and average restaurant style but this place is lit for partying have fun,5,
had great time this place  food here are awesome nice place to chill with your friends appreciate rahulstar for his patience and the hospitality,5,
cool place to hang out food is good thanks to rahulstar he is amazing guy he was with us for our whole event  been very quick  supportive,5,
only place in hyderabad with really good music to party they have got huge dance floor with all the perfect light effects awesome crowd as well,4,
"i have visited the place on 3 occasions twice on weekends and once in weekday getting seats on weekends is very difficult also the entry is charged for couple as well as stag however it is covered in bill

pros
1 great ambience
2 very big dance floor
3 hindi music after 10pm even on week days
4 food is fine

cons
1 uncomfortable sitting especially if wearing short dresses
2 on weekends service is very slow
3 drinks are tooooo expensive and can easily cause a dent on pocket",4,
poor service tasteless food we went there for a corporate party but even after paying too much we felt like its not worth even half the value,1,
"best night club in hyderabad amazing hospitality fb and service they have the best dj is and recognized artists playing on a regular basis shoutout to the inhouse dj is who uplift the ambience with their groovy tunes the confetti and the smoke guns are a visual treat the centre lighting piece of the dance floor is spectacular and on of a kind you will be glued to it the crowd is sofesticated and a great experience to meet new people who enjoy similar taste in music the owners have done a great job in developing the night life culture which hyderabad was missing out on the staff is always on their toes and are super friendly

if you are a party freak or you enjoy good music with your drinks this is the place to be you will not regret it

ps space and breathing room is never a problem here and their washrooms are super clean and well lit",5,
"the new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its usp

i went here with my team on friday night and booked upper deck for the same the place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in hyderabad the light system and other props were good it reminded me of club octagon in gangnam seoul overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups

food is just average here starters like paneer tikka baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy main course was also not upto the mark

worst thing i experienced about this place is the service
i asked person attending us to start the main course at 830 pm to which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready it would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm  this really pissed me off and ruined whole experience

i wanted to give 1 star but giving it 2 just because of ambience

"prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space and rightly so

the place is located somewhere in financial district after you take a turn from the lemon tree hotel i pretty much had no clue about where i was exactly and the almost stranded road is of not much help until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word prism inscribed on it though conveniently covered by the bushes around it another 100m or so you reach their parking yard and finally the enter the premises after it

a huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena for a lack of better word that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor the place has high tables next to the dance area and then some couches on the far side there is a beautifully lit up staircase that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating

and that is just one part of it they have an outdoor seating where the projector is put up for the match screening and doubles up as the smoking zone apart from this they have a pool which would be apt for a private gathering

i am no club expert but their light system is sure one of their usp the dj played majorly bollywood that evening it was a wednesday and did a decent enough job

while the place is all decked up pretty well the food on offer did not impress me much

starters

burmese roll with sweet chilli dip a bit too oily they were okay to munch on they could have done with a bit more filling though

punjabi paneer tikka with mint dip failed to impress the paneer was too rubbery in some places and in others too charred the lingering taste was merely of chilli and nothing else

mains

prism special veggie lover pizza the dish that fared best with me it was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese for the price it may seem a bit costly but quite worth it as compared to other dishes

spaghetti their take of spaghetti aglio olio with mushrooms and black olive toppings this was also decent

penne alfredo this was just regular nothing good or bad and this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread

i did not find the indian mains anything great and needs to be improved a lot

the dessert was another downer chocolate truffle was all goey and just cream

from the mocktails section i chose the safest bet go crazy it was a twist on the oreo shake with the inclusion of kitkat but it was not great either lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake

if you are looking for a party place that has a happening setup good crowd and amazing ambience this is your best bet but for the food it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas they would give you the best value for money the alcohol is also a little pricey but you wouldnt mind that in a place like this",3,
"by invite

the pub is located in the financial district in gachibowli the pub is currently the largest in hyderabad in terms of area as you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music

the pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights the ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs the usp of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of led rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this

there is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor

coming to the food

punjabi paneer tikka rs 325
thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base was not soft and requires lot of improvement a strict no to this dish

burmese rolls rs 275
a different kind of spring rolls filled with corn garlic and cheese the taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip the only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily

mains

for the mains we had exotic vegetables in black pepper with rice the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but did not have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it

prism special veg pizza
the thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served the pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either the pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders

apart from these we were also served veg pulao and meloni tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped

drinks

cucumber coriander mocktail the cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet the flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander

go crazy
the blend of oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake

recommended dishes

burmese rolls
prism pizza if you need a main course

the place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life so is not recommended

"emerging as one of the best clubs in hyderabadfor those who love partying this place is indeed for you

plus points
1 great space
2 utilized well in terms of inner area private section seating is lighting dj console outer smoke area and swimming pool space for mini party gatherings and very important parking
3 dance floor is great unless in lot of clubs its get so crowded and claustrophobic
4 bar counter looks absolute great
5 barmen showing all juggling skills is eye candy experience
6 good varieties of drinks but they can improve on that part a bit
7 few good finger foods get you sorted for your party plans

minus 

1 food wise they need to improve as it is normal nothing special or different and price wise it is not that competitive
2 staff over here need bit of training in terms of hospitality being rigid spoils the mood a cute smile can change lot of things

starters 

chicken lahsooni was good garlic taste was evident but overpowered which is a good thing served with mini papad rolls and chutney burmese rolls is something which i relished with corn and green chilies with some cheese stuffing it got in my favorite list fish fingers was too was decent enough pizza was good too both chicken and farm fresh pizza as toppings were loaded but make sure you have it hot or warm as you like they certainly need to improve the pasta and paneer tikka 

all in all a great place for partying and events organised by prism management  do not miss them at all monday to thursday they mostly play bollywood and commercial hits corporate crowd is regular as lots of multi national companies are in neighborhood friday to sunday they have different themes like electro techno and edm so all those partyholics have a blast at this new place in hyderabad

happy partying guys

"an evening well spent at prism club and kitchen the place is situated relatively outside the main city in financial district and has a huge area to offer one can enjoy poolside as well as at the sitting which is offered near the dance floor with big live screens and a great dj there is a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place

started my food experience with their appetizers i tried out their punjabi paneer tikka fish finger lehsooni murgh tikka and veg burmese rolls the punjabi paneer tikka was good it had an exquisite flavor to it which was top notch served along with onion salad and traditional mint chutney one can give this dish a shot next up their fish fingers were quite normal for my palate they could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option 

my favorite dish of the night was their lehsooni murgh tikka it had a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flakes to it and was super tender the spice mix was really complimenting the chicken and is a must try for you all veg burmese rolls was a big disappointment for me it had some extra oil to it which could have been clearly avoided they need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the rolls

for their drinks i tried out their cosmopolitan margarita and passion all the drinks were simply wonderful it was truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drinks at this place

for mains i had their exotic vegetables in black pepper sauce with rice farmer chicken pizza penne white sauce pasta exotic vegetables in black pepper sauce was good i usually do not like to have this at most outlets due to the overpowering taste of the black pepper sauce but somehow these guys served it very well alongside some rice their farmer chicken pizza was too good loved the overall consistency of the dish a slight work needs to be put up in their pasta i did not find it much cheesy and tasty 

the place setup is quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food great place for partying for sure happy eating ",4,
"such a pathetic experience i had in this place 
first i called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 pm on a sunday the person who received call on behave of prism stated that it is open from 6 pm once we reach there by 630 pm no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now the way they spoke to their customer is really annoying i do not know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but as you came early i am considering you and giving a table is this how low they treat a customer 

secondly when requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available the manager or a person with attitude told us no there are no seats availablein a bold manner when i checked from zomato there are plenty of tables available i got pinched with irritation though i felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends

finally me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer and then mosquitoes came into picture there are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no ac has turned on out of frustration we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered they said it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes i was like wtf i asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place such a disappointing experience it was i suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well",1,
great place to party really good experience lights music and visuals everything was pretty awesome we went on friday it was bollywood night so had great fun must visit pub and expensive too,5,
"prism the best place in hyderabad

"it really been long time i have visited this place late review was busy with work
the place has got good dance floor it has got many areas in it indoor pool area  garden area
visited this place for event hilight tribe booked a vip pass entry  from book my show app near the entry they taped a band our wrist after entering into the prism the managers over there and bouncers over there did not allow us to enter the area which was up  saying it is full than okay den make us seat some where they where like stand near the bar counter it was so annoying we paid some 3000 rupees for vip entry per ticket and they do not allow to vip area and say to stand near bar  dan we asked the manager two give table he said u have to pay 10000 per table  i said it is not mentioned in book my show app tat we have to pay for table and ur not allowing us to go up to vip area what is this he was like ur wish madam dan i said see we r all gals u should at least allow us to enter vip area he was again like full dan we got really paronoid  seee gals need safety we just can not be in common crowd he did not understood tat also dan we had to make a call hope u understand dan we got a table after a calll so cheap f these managers there
than we got our personal waiter too after d call
my question is what about a common people who can not make calls and get the work done so better develop ur managers if u have taken money for vip let d crowd enter into tat area if u do not have place do not issue tickets mention in book my show about booking a table separately for the amount make sure u serve the people for what u have told

the drinks and food was not that great it is over priced compared to other top places in hyderabad

every one earns there money with hard work so the owner of the place plz do think f the common crowd u charge but provide dem for what u have charged hope u understand and make the changes
place is good",1,

very spacious and one does not feel suffocated in here unlike the other baloconyterraceturned pubs here in the city

this place charges both an entry fee and a cover charge we ordered the wasabi prawns  what they delivered was great  but i tasted no wasabi so our order was clearly wrong the cinderella mocktail was insanely sweet no one at our table could finish it despite promising us for over an hour to find us an indoor table they sat us outdoor with the mosquitos which they werent able to control with citronella sticks the dance floor was very active with an amazing dj though not nearly enough ac so it smelled like sweaty guys,2,
the best place or rather i should the best pub in indiai really enjoy my weekend parties herewhether its edm or bollywood or hiphop this place is a blastideal for any kind of partiesdj rabz is the resident dj who does a really great job in keeping our feet moving and never lets the impulse go downkeep it up rabz and prism,5,

"awesome place for a party  great dance floor and infact one of the largest pubs food space and lights made my party
anthonygreat ambience would love to see managers like you in every pub",5,
this place was in my bucket list for quite some time visited there last week with my colleagues this is the best lively pub i have been to in hyderabad the various lights create a different atmosphere and the dj was too good coming to food the price is on the higher side but quality and taste is great,5,
so we had gone here in a group on a weekday and the overall experience was good the main attraction was the huge space and the lights which already set the mood the dj was awesome even on a weekday with a mix of hollywood and bollywood songs the taste of food was also good the only problem we faced was the tat for each order we had to wait for like over 40 mins for each order to arrive also there was a discrepancy in the bill which we realised only the next day so better be careful before paying the amount also the prices were little on the higher side happy partying,4,
india is best club to do party on weekends powerful light system amazing drinks highlife bar super sound system the poolside make feel so perfect after party just a word for prism  wow,5,
it was awesome having fun prism great environment and one of the best pub i would say vamshi and naresh were hosted wonderful services,5,
it is undoubtedly one of the best pubs of hyderabad although the ambience is great and the food is dlicieux the lighting system steals the show best place for corporate parties visvis other pubs in the city,5,

"the first thing that one would notice after entering prism is the areasize of the club i think it is the biggest club in india at least for me based on my experience everything from the music to food service interiors area is great the attraction is the centre light that moves with the musicbeats very big dance floor and good djs

wow it is amazing the place is huge and ambiance is too good i guess one of the best party places in this part of hyderabad altaf is at his best he took us around and showed us a nice outdoor place karthik attended the table he is an amazing guy his service is impeccable he suggested mongolian chicken which is very fresh and tasty usually food at clubs does not really match the restaurant quality but this is too good will visit again sometime soon,5,
visited this place today and it is located in an outlying area of gachibowli food ambience and hospitality was decent there is private space available for private parties with a poolside bar counter,4,
i visited this place last sunday music is okaybut very big place like cinema theatre food was not much betterlighting was okay but not creativeservice was goodinside not smoking its bad thing end of the day it is like build a club feel but not proper club feel,4,
"big on ambience food and music miserably fails at politeness

called up this place to reserve a table for two on a friday night they said please walk in no reservations required for two the place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation and the ones remaining were well about to be reserved so you can not sit if you are less than three head to the bar because that is exactly where they like pushing everyone to

the service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied 

the place is all lights and show and great for nightlife the food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front",3,
the place on outskirts in financial district have visited this place on february 1st dj suketu 1st friday of 2019 with office team the property is huge as you enter the club there not much seating for crowd as i have heard its biggest club in hyderabad the food was tasty and service very quick even after they have huge crowd the staff is polite and helpful dj suketu was awesome he played superb bollywood tunes it has a seperate smoking zone outside which is good overall its good experience,5,
the place as you enter it you can see how huge this property is the staff is very polite and helpful their service is quick even after they have so much crowd but there is not much seating for everyone to sitmy special thanks to prism and team and my specail thanks to dear  mranthony thanks for such a beautiful night with loud good music and service,5,
food was decent and the starters were average location looks odd as its near the orr and bit hard to find service was ok and the interesting part in the ambience is the roof top lights transforms it is shape with music,3,
been there for my office party last week ambiance looks good once lights are on loved the dance floor and dj staff was professional and friendly  food was ok ok,4,
absolutely astonishing place to be when you wanna chill or party hard been here in december 2018 for anjunadeep is gig it was worth the time food ambience people  everything was wow i really had a great time,5,
one of the best pub in gachibowli killer ambience with awesome lighting and sound was there on 03feb2019 and dj was mariana bo tracks played by her was so groovy and all beats were just apt for the night must recommend to everyone who like clubbing,5,
too good i was here on 2nd feb djmerina is too good more over pub ambience is also good coming to price it is worth for what they charge there,5,
"such a beautiful place in hyderabad  love to bee here  music are top of the city  friendly staffs see you soon  good thing it is out of city see you soon ",5,
"its almost out skirts but a good place to hang out on week ends  space is lavish and ambience is great  best light effects and sounding systems 
food is okay but i feel it was over priced",4,
"pros
awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen
cool ambience
they always have the best djs
cons
too much vip culture almost all the tables are reserved it is almost impossible to get a table you are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the vips even if you somehow managed to order standing in that cranked space you will not be able to enjoy the food entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge after paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks

but hey if you love dancing there is no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this",4,
"prism it is one of the most happening club in the pearl city amazing ambiance with a pretty huge dance floor which you cannot stay of out off bhoom must visit place with a bunch of gigs bar counter is set up at its best good food for sure has a pretty big smoking zone which does not make you suffocate lol must visit for sure with ya loved ones ",5,
"i have been on friday night and reached at round 10pm
it was almost full we hardly get space for standing
they occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead
we could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood
i must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group
dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent
zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising  even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people ",3,
i would say this was one of the best clubs i have visited in india lights music and the over all experience was extravaganza would love to visit this place again soon,5,
food booze and masti all at the best price and lively atmosphere one should surely visit the place is best for youngster and the beer freak nice pitcher you would get here  my splz tankx to vijay kumar he served super  with splz items,5,
"i have been to this place on weekday  the ambience was really good but when it comes to the music  the dj played only selected songs which did not give us an energy to enjoy the place  this was the main drawback to this place other than that everything was fine ",4,
fine that you are taking cover charge but why are you deructing rs250we did not get place to seat then why is this defuctionare you not going to take service charge,1,
been here on a weekday the ambience is mind blowing the lights they will drive you crazy  in a good or a bad way i was disappointed with food and drinks ordered chicken 65  was very bland cajun onion rings  these were decent french fries  were saggy the dj was not that great all he played were punjabi songs overall i feel like this place is over priced the food and drinks werent worth it,3,
"irresponsible restaurant  please do not order any food from there i ordered mushroom masala  not good in taste and 3 different types of roti is and in place of roti is they people are delivering white rice

"its a nice place good food and good ambience

ambience  ambience is good and contemporary

staff  staff is efficient humble and very thoughtful ordered veg machurian but the manchurian balls were pretty hard we expressed our concern to the staff staff being very thoughtful immediately replaced veg manchurian with the better version

food  you get authentic chinese cuisines ordered veg dimsums momos burnt garlic fried rice and veg manchurian with gravy everything turned out to be very tasty",5,
i went to this place for lunch with my mom and dad the ambience is quite decent with a lot of seating places we ordered chicken coriander soup golden fried prawns a mixed fried rice and a plate of dry chilly chicken golden fried prawns were a bit plain it could have been more flavourful the soup was good fried rice and chily chicken were good in taste all costed us around rs 1400 it was a light and good meal i would like to revisit this place again,4,

must try 
1 sesame chicken",4,
though i love chinese but this place was a big disappointment for us the taste was too bad the price is high lamb was not properly cooked it tasted like rubber chilly chicken was so bland crispy honey chicken was not at all crispy we had to ask them to re do it somehow they have not maintained thr quality nor taste,2,
good food does the justice to your chinese cravingn nothing spellbinding but the bamboo rice must deserve a wow complementit is a must try and that is the only reason i am giving 1 star extra,4,
good food decent service not crowded especially for weekend lunch ambience is average worth the money is predominantly chinese food and not pan asian,4,
this place gives you some really good chinese dishes and the portion size per dish is really good the dumplings noodles and fish main course are the best that i have tried here the staff is also really helpful and quick with their service,4,
interior and location of this restaurant is good but i did not like food that much this place is near to my room so i thought of visiting once i ordered manny items i did not get satisfaction,3,
"i went there yesterday night with my friends around 10pm they welcomed us by saying the starters will not be available so we should rather start with the main course ordered veg schezwan rice and pan fried noodlesthe food was decent the funny part was as soon as the food arrived they requested us to pay the bill the food was okayish but we are thankful they did not kick us out while we were eating

in short horrible service",2,
"ordered via switch phuket fish and mixed chilli garlic noodles the fish was so tasty that we craved for more and the noodles never thought it can be this tasty from a restaurant in the south without any south dish influence
must must try",5,
"ohh finally the wait is over i have been seeing this restaurant from quite sometime and finally i am at dine o china from outside it looks good i got flat 50 offer from dine out that is exciting

first thing to try was chicken tom yum soup ohh it was one good tasting soup i had for a while and then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn it surprised me as well never seen this in a chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was horrible battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere with my experience i would call it a piece of  it was all crapy and when i asked i got the reply that the chinese chef has changed and they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn it was ok for my liking

now we have ordered

 chicken drumsticks

shezwan chicken dimsums

singapore noodles mix

chinese chopsuey

yang chow rice

schezwan chicken

to sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks 

dimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy

singapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles

yan chow rice was good

so was schezwan chicken

experience was decent i would say specially with the offer i got flat 50 off

a loud shout out to the dine out team 

i would wish to come again if i get such offer  but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant please try and make some change as we have very less chinese restaurant nearby 

thanks",3,
"amazing food quality and taste were both top notch staff were friendly seating was very comfortable ambience was good all in all i had an excellent
outing",5,
"had a great time enjoying the delicious food  ordered cantonese soup  dim sum and basket noodles and ended with fried ice cream  each and every item was served and presented very nicely and was delicious  to all those reading this try ordering the special foods that this place serves to have the best experience of eating out here and most importantly order an egg fu yang for sure to go with the main coarse  pricing is reasonable considering the food and ambience and a meal at this place will surely fit into the budget  cheers ",5,

"best place to have authenticated chinese food

the chef was tremendous

overall the best place to visit with family and friends

suggestion have bamboo fried rice and dumplings for sure

and fried ice cream yummm",5,
pathetic service took an hour for the order to deliver even though there were only 2 tables occupied no one has an answer for the delay the entire eating experience is ruined not visiting the place again,2,
good quality sea food i love mixed pan fried noodles the most too healthy food and the quantity is also good i feel dine o china as the best chinese restaurant available here,5,
i loved the mixed nonveg noodles it was everything that i like in the noodles dish the awesome amount of meat pieces and eggs it was well made thank you it made my day,5,
"if you want a good chinese food this is the right place to visit a good service given by msuma chhetriambience is decent
will surely visit again",4,
had gone for dinner ordered veg manchow sour veg manchuria chilly paneer dry schezwan rice and chilly garlic noodles and assorted vegetables in choice of sauce all veg the soup had too much of cornflour was not that nice manchuria was ok ok chilly paneer rice and the gravy were good could have been a little more spicy as had already requested them at the time of ordering the service was quick and good and fresh as the restaurant was half occupied and they had good take away orders too overall a nice experience,4,
"it was a date with my girls who wanted to eat chinese so we decided to go to dine o china for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have chinese
the restaurant is located in gachibowli and is easy to drive to from orr and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy gachibowli road for me it is a major point of concern if i am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted
we entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us it felt like by the women for the women it felt comfortable that is all
the seating arrangement is quite comfortable and i particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable we ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate they were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be
for our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix chinese chopsuey both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial but i would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato i find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums
the mix chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it
for dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as i did not like it that much
infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also and also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner
we liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure

pity zomato does not give me chance to review the place on my second visit like i mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves we tried chilli garlic fish kids favourite chicken drumsticks again chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup all of which was great
we asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty
definitely a must visit place will be back again when i am craving for some yummy chinese food


coinsandmapscom",4,
no vinegar or soya sauce has been provided with the soup,4,
oh terrible pan fried noodles so salty and no spices whatsoever ordered pan fried noodles and what we received is a box of dry noodles and a box of cornstarch based salty soup infused with vegetables there was no description of the dish to be like this on the menu they might have other good dishes on the menu but pan fried noodles is not their specialty for sure,1,

"we ordered simple nonveg dishes and liked the flavours they added to these simple dishes to make them taste good

overall its a nice experience to have food from this restaurant",4,
i went to this place as a part of our sunday dinner i already heard so much about this place from my friend the taste of the food is no doubt good but i found stone in the soup i ordered thankfully it does not go inside my stomach unfortunately no body bothers to say sorry they just gave 73 discount to us the waiter was also very cunning first when we complained about the stone he said he will discount but later he came with the bill without discount so we again asked him to give some discount then only he came up with new bill,2,

too oily for my liking,2,
dint taste good at all had food in dine o china before and was very impressed with the food but the ordered food tasted like roadside chinese noodles,2,
the momos and spring rolls were good but the rest were not there s mushroom in padthai and it is too spicy but not flavoursome pad thais are meant to be tasteful with peanuts and flavours of spring onions this padthai just has gun powder in it the sauce for the noodles was so hot that the container almost melted and the taste of the sauce went bitter i suggest that better quality containers be used for packaging,2,
satisfied with order and as well as delivery,5,

"worst service and the food is patheticbiryani is not at all hot and the chicken is stored one which smells very badcoming to chicken lollipopwhen we ordered it he brought drumsticks and saying it is lollipopthey are trying make customers fools and making cash for the ppl who comes as team outing on friday

"we went last night to have couple of drinks after hectic schedule this place is for the people who love to sit outdoor with good live music with bollywoodsthe service quality of drinjs was nice ",5,
this is a gem of a place in the busy hitech city love the live music that happens there on weekends all the starters and main course are top class no complaints here the waiters take extra care of you inside so extra points there for sure,5,
very laid back staff we ordered chilli toast and got the order served after half an hour just to toast a piece of bread they took 30 minutes literally i had to follow up twice or thrice the cocktail was not better either it tasted just like water with a hint of vodka and i had to ask for sauces to go with the fish i ordered no side fresh salads or sauces to go with the main the fish tasted good though it was slightly over cooked they can improve their service levels to a great extent and also their food it somehow gave me a feeling that they did not bother about the customers,2,
i have been here for the new year party and it was fun moreover it was effordable it is a cozy place and the crowd is decent music is good and the food is good,4,
excellent food great customer service verities of cocktails and verities of beverages its an excellent place to weekend for get together with friends and family bartenders are truly amazing with their services with a smile you will always remember sonu and anmol for their friendly nature with greatly handled customers must visit placefor me i can hangout daily if possible again great place to hang out with friends,5,
i was there on saturday night and they had a band performance as well it was nice music they were performingplaying bollywood and sufi tracks we seated outside because of bandoverall it is pocket friendly as well if you are a beer lover,5,
"because surbhi garg did not like
the food was served very very late
bad service the guy says food will be served but took 1 hr to serve not expected",1,
worst experience ever they did not serve food till 11 pathetic music starters were cold no one was there to serve drinks  it was a group event we all were very disappointing,1,
worst place ever came for a party they did not serve food drinks arrogant staff not even one waiter in a team of 25 people music is pathetic ambience sucks,1,
"visited on sunday evening
surprisingly it was quiet 
but loved the ambiance 
it is quite spacious
had it been a lil more crowded i would have given 5s
overall thumbs up",4,
it is always a pleasure to go back  the food seems to get better every time  the desserts specially are something to die for this time we tried tiramisu and blueberry cheesecake they were both so moist and melt in the mouth,5,
i keep going back to this place for the amazing service in terms of food and drinks both the ambience is good and good to watch match as well they have indoor as well as outdoor seating they have a small attic area as well which can be booked for private parties,4,
the food over here is good there are lot of drinks from menu which is not available moreover they charge wrongly increasing the count of items you ordered,1,
always good to visit this place amazing deserts great ambience awesome staff suggested best try is blue berry cheesecake do not miss the sign on washroom entrance,5,
"great food good ambience and decent seating decent service and good for team get together and celebrations

my evening watering hole while at holiday inn in hyderabad good pizza and a decent selection of drinks the music is okay tends to get a bit too loud later but there is always the outside seating for the quietears,4,
it was nice and happening place the crowd is nice food is 35 ambience is 45 service is 455 over all a perfect weekend or even mid week party place,4,
this place is perfect for party for weekends and weekdays love for music and alcohol  food so delighted by the service from mr avijit bag will definitely visit this place again,5,

thanks team komatose

regards
vilas reddy",5,
"the things which impressed me was the the cocktails based on seven sins the ambience is calm and soothing for people who do not like bustle in a bar
it is not a bar for partying it is bar to chilling",4,
worst place and worst service without any prior intimation they stopped taking orders for a crispy corn they took 1 hour will never recommend this place,1,
the dj is not great there was not much crowd though it was a weekend the drinks are just fine service is good dj and ambience have to be improved a lot,2,
"i was staying at holiday inn for one month so this is the place where i had my first party in hyderabad so this place will remain always special to me also we had many team parties over here

they have drunch on saturday and sunday  it is like unlimited drinks and starters also on weekdays they have karaoke and live music one of the good party place in gacchibowli they even have outside seating area

overall a perfect party place",4,
will recommend this place for friday afteroffice parties the hummas and pita bread here is just heaven also the crispy corn is just yummy,4,
felt like i was attending a marriage reception on a saturday night this place has changed quite a lot over the years or maybe the timing was not right,2.5,
"such an amazing place definitely a 5 rated 
there is indoor and outdoor seating  the outdoor seating was too good  as we have been here during evening the cool breeze was soothing 
the service is quick n fast and the staff was very friendly 
we have ordered chilli chicken  onion rings  pizza  fish fingers all are equally delicious

"we are visited komatose holiday inn inn express
my small party nice place nice ambience live music good food was excellent nice service staff very friendly we enjoyed hangout party fully awesome",5,
excellent food n drinksamazing atmosphereloved iti had opted for buffet with drinkswould have loved to have a bigger dance floor,5,
"the bar ambiance is good we ordered chilli broccoli and that had mix of broccoli and cauliflower broccoli was tasty
it is at the outer area so there was problem for booking a cab also at 830 pm while returning",2,
"we went there yesterday and as usual they did not have many foreign beers present but mentioned in menu

second they provided custom menu for zomato gold and asked to get free drink only from that menu zomato gold and this restaurant is not good as they keep changing conditions and we customers suffer zomato says you can get free dish from complete menu and
manager said no we can only give free dish from custom small menu",2,
"good place to hangout in gachibowli crowd was average but ambience wasnt what i expected either but good food not budget friendly but worth it as its so yummy
has a dance floor but we need to book it earlier it seems not open for all that is disappointing",3,
"komatose holiday inn is a place which will guarantee you a great timewhether you are in group or alone

the hospitality of the staff especially of our usual host balia nima is a delight his pleasing personality and positive smile is one of the things which makes this place special the skipper abhivir singh hope i spelt correctly is a delight to meet everytime",5,
nice ambiance but not very beautiful must try pizza it was awesome music is good with sound system very gentle to ears overall it was good,4,
please do not visit this place as a part of official team lunch we sat in komatose but food buffet was from johnathans kitchen seating is comfortable for drinks but not for having food staff was busy serving alcohol as it churns more money we were ignored big time and were even charged 100 rupees for one kinley bottle air condition was switched off probably hence we were sweating profusely my first experience of komatose and johnathons kitchen was bad and would neither visit or recommend anyone for this place,3,
pathetic service no point in visiting this restaurant during the happy hours if they are going to refute the orders no drink available no starters available waiter is giving stupid excuses about not serving food before happy hours what is this service why do you even have happy hours when you do not want to serve the happy hours menu very poor customer experience and never going to visit this place again in future tagging bishwajeet jha,1,
"nice place to hang out with friends pop up a beer and have a blast given it is so close to office space we were served by balia lima who took care of everything we wanted with a smile making our day the best

cheers",5,
"happy happy hours

they know how to make you happy during the happy hours food is tasty and right sized portions the service needs a little up lift",4,
"had a terrible exp on saturday night 22nd sep i have been quite regular to komotos on friday eve woh my office colleagues and had good exp so far tonight i recommended this place to my friend for dine out

when my friend arrived the staff at the kitchen told there is no alacarte tonight only option is buffet so they started with buffet when i reached it a little surprise to me and i checked with the manager there mr abhiveer he also denied about the alacarte so we continued with buffet later while walking around the buffet spread we learnt that alacarte is also there and three ppl lied to us as i am a big fan of their hamas and pita dish i asked for the menu and mr abhiveer is sayin we do not have menu please check the menu in zomato what who the hell ll publish the menu only on zomato in a restaurant and are the customers fool enough

buffet food options for vegetarians are very less their dessert spread was good though

their service was also pathetic for the indian bread and other stuff after asking numerous time for spoons and tissues this is how the tissues were served to us on the table plz refer the pic we had 3 kids with us imagine how long these tissues would have been their in this manner 

big no to ppl if you want to have just one or two dishes there we got trapped today",1,
"this place is love it is your everyday bar
this place not just welcomes regular customers but make the leave a mark literally you will find name plates of it is regular customers all over the bar and their bartenders absolutely know how to keep the customers happy this is one place where you will find more people sitting at the bar rather than the regular seating arrangement it has

sonu being their star bartender you will find almost everyone calling him out for their drinks and he absolutely takes care of all his regulars with a smile we usually order a whiskey sour and sangria being our absolute favorite accompanied by crispy corn and their signature pizza which is baked fresh out of their jonathan is kitchen

if you are a party animal you will find this place a hit on thursdays where they take their ladies night very seriously all drinks on the house

i would absolutely recommend this place if you are looking for your next regular bar
as the saying goes you should always be a regular for more than one bar and this should absolutely be on your list",5,
visited for a dinner with family loved the options available on the menu the ambience and the courteousness of the staff food was yummy and i must say the playing was fabulous hats off to the chef a must visit,5,
"komatose turned out to be a nice little place the fooddrinks the ambiance the live music  everything was nice they have great options for both buffet and a la carte they even have an open sitting area which adds to the overall appeal

recommendation  a must visit if you are in the area

 the live music is available only on saturdays  as far as i know",4,
"fantastic place to hangout with your buddies the cheapest beer in whole of hyderabad as per the hotel standards is here

they also have a seating area outside which is like a tent

dj plays good music and a visit during sports season must not be missed",5,
"located inside holiday inn this place is decorated decently well i enjoyed the seating music and decor the service for me was average unfortunately it was difficult to catch the waiter is attention the drinks were decent and the food was a little oily for my liking overall it was a nice place and is not as expensive as i had initially expected also zomato gold is always a wonderful added advantage ",4,
komatose in 2017 was a very happening place for promoting psychedelic music culture i had one of the best after parties here the music used to be loud and blasting till 4am in recent times i have not heard anything about komatose but i still have a feel for the place and the vibes are too good   indoors and outdoors,5,
"the place is good jonathan is kitchenrestaurant is attached with that you can have dinner over there

bad thing services are very slow you will feel like you are in restaurant not in the bar the music is also not good according to the environment",3,
worst ever experience booking this place for corporate dinner they do not have any courtesy and sense when they talk to the customers reservation team had no intention to do business we would never ever recommend this place to anyone,1,
booking a place here for a corporate package is absolutely horrendous they provided the menu and package details on friday and confirmed its available and on monday  the day of the event  management was rude and was insisting they will not provide the buffet but will charge the same price as per the package they did not have minimum courtesy and were not even respecting the fact that our manager  a lady  was trying to talk this is probably the worst ever team i had ever talked to very disappointing this has resulted in cancellation of our corporate party which consisted of several partners and managing directors i would never recommend this place to anyone,1,
"a great place always leaves us with good memories at the back of mind still remember i was here for my first drinks date with my now wife and then girlfriend a great place with good vives coperative staff and great ambiance the crowd is great at this place what can one expect from holiday inn
guys and gals be at this place to make best of yoit memories

cheers rakshita nath",5,
great service as the staff is very friendly and gives a personalised touch to your evening the ambiance here is outstanding it gives a different vibe all together this is one of the only bars in the city where even if you come alone you will end having a great time and find great company for yourself without fail food is something to try the new menu is out of this world i tried the kumbh ke galaoti and murgh malai tikka and they were finger licking i would give them a 6 star,5,
"we booked a table at 545 but they dint have any data regarding our booking at 815pm
we were made to sit at 2 tables before allocating one this took about 20mins we would have went to another place but hiteccitytraffic
happy with the service  the food",3,
"went there with some work friends the place is cozy and attracts business crowd the food is good for bar menu the service could have been better we had to reach out to the staff multiple tomes to the extent of walking up to them to ask for stuff
the ambiance is nothing to write home about but it is ok",3,
"you know what is the best part of hospitality fulfilling every silly need of the customer absolutely loved the service kudos to the staff i can not say enough of their service well done there a small suggestion add some dishes other than panner in vegetariani want you to take this seriously and implement it in the buffet  other than that no complaints you guys are awesome
we will keep coming back there no stopping us 
keep feeding us the way u r doing it
great stuff",5,
the ambience was good but bar tenders were rude on ladies night treating us like they are the ones sponsoring us drinks need to improve their service,3,
"what to say this place blew me away from the moment i entered
went there after attending a comedy gig and this place continued the fun
the band aatish official were rocking that day never heard the better band then them in any pub in hyderabad i dont have words to praise them enough
coming to the food  it was delicious and the quantity were sufficient
staff was good and took care of us well even though the place was crowded
the only thing to be improved is that the manager n bouncers should be able to handle the drunk persons better there was a group of people celebrating a birthday but they were all over the place they were disturbing the band and also other people just could not get on dance floor thats the only thing due to which i am not giving this place a 5 hope it doesnt happen again when i visit next and also hope aatish official are there when i come",4,
we had an awesome experience therewith live music and friendly ambienceloved the live music numbersnot too much options in veg though but good to sit down and relax after a tiring busy work schedule,4,
excellent place for hangout is with friends very nice ambient and the rocking live music awesome food and drinks also perfect for your date,5,
i usually dont write reviews this is perhaps my first one and you should probably guess the level of my frustration with this place just one wordsmall and deplorable cold food and poor service sums it all quite surprising that this is part of an elite chainactually shocking have spare moneygo to a better placenot this one,1,
this is right inside the holiday inn liquor is cheap compared to other joints dj is fantastic  just ensure there are no office parties going on so that you will not be left out,4,
ambience is okay  no dance floor  average music  no energized atmosphere  a class place for people who want to drink in peace  paneer was good  peanuts were good,3,
great place with nice ambiencecocktail is was amazing mouth watering food with neat service nice place to hangout with friends  family too,5,
"been here on a weekend with friends as this is attached to jk  ordered a red bull  grilled murrel with herb rice and dragon prawns fyi i am a seafood lover  coming to the review of each  murrel was grilled to perfection  the way i like it with some veggies  murrel is my favorite fish and it needs to be cooked perfectly to enjoy its taste and it was made too good  this was served with rice and some veggies  coming to dragon prawns again perfectly cooked and made to perfection  komatose as a place is good to hang out with friends and enjoy after a tiring day  weekend the staff here is friendly and moreover the managers are welcoming and helps you out on your selection according to your mood  taste ",5,
"komatose on a sunday night is the perfect place to be happened to be drizzling which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas

inside was a pretty small area for a bar but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above overlooking the area below lighting was funky and great the vibrant colors adding to the vibe 

being a big bunch we ordered different drinks and luckily i got to taste all the most special of these were from the 7 deadly sins of koma menu the taste was as described on the menu lust in particular was something different i would never tasted before a chillispiced vodka strawberry infusion

the appetizers we had we are really good something i enjoyed more than the alcohol
dragon prawns grilled pomfret peshawar chapali kebabs are some of the must orders did not quite like the nawabi shikhampuri while all the items tasted great i felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price

best for the last not being a kid here but the mocktails were just mindblowing had a few different fruit flavors peach mango green apple lime out of which the peach was the best multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush 

the service was professional and quick would have wished for better music and there was no dj at the music station however we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great it is a perfect place to watch a match screening have a party or if you are in the mood for it go into comatose 

here is my overall score
food  355
ambience  355
vfm  355
service  355",3.5,
"it is my 3rd visit to koma and this time i could not try much of their drinks but this is a place where you actually can party and and chill at the same time
sitting in cabanas just outside the door if you are are party freak you would like to be inside but who can deny to a live music and enjoying a lovely time with your gang

the drinks i liked where virgin mojito lust and gluttony all of them were quite different from each other and tastes really well
special thanks to the guy who prepared all of these drinks

overall 55
ambiance 55  if you are on a weekend
drinks 55",5,
i have been here couple of time the inside seating is very small but the dj is good they have beautiful outdoor seating food wise it is average nothing fancy about it it is a place to just hangout with friends and chill expectations for high quality food should not be there,3,
"no option to give zero or less visited the place with friends during the happy hours

food and drinks friends has opted for whiskey and myself has ordered for mocktail requested for less sugar syrup  which was not honoured at all food portion was so less that a kid can gulp it at one go some of the items were reheated and served

the biggest surprise came along with bill  they thought the group was drunk and no matching to the number of drinks ordered vs billed serious integrity issues we called them to correct which took good amount of time least bothered to apologize or explain no go placeblocked the place",1,
the management is naive and doesnt know how to keep the place happening the happy hours timing goes for a toss as they have limited or better to say nothing at disposal during that time only your frustrated mood can save your day and only focussing on your drinks is the thing you could do here,2,
"visited this place with friends and loved the overall experience they have a great dj and also live music space  they also have an open space where you can hangout with your friends and enjoy fresh air the service is awesome and very dedicated to customer satisfaction
tried greed among the cocktails which had the base of whiterum  brandy along with lime and orange one of the 7 deadly sins of koma among the mocktails had blackcurrent  lime and peach and also green appleprepared on request which were cool enough to have among the starters we tried fish  chicken  prawn dishes overall a very nice experience ",5,
"good food
awesome ambience
you will enjoy very much
if somebody else is paying the bill
there s nothing better than a sponsored lunch
quality nice",4,
"few weeks back after a tiring day out we decided to spend the evening at komatose choosing to sit outside we got to know that they have grill and chill saturdays the live music for that night had been set outdoors the weather being fairly pleasant it was good to hear atish dole out melodious numbers one after the another got a request he would be more than willing to fit it in
coming to the food after a long time i had a great paav bhaji this was part of the live counters there i hasked for some extra butter on paavs to which the cook readily complied d
another live counter had paneer and veg rolls tried the paneer one and liked it for the mains you have a lot of options to choose from do give the pizza a try
the desserts are another wide spread you find both desi and fancy desserts i tried the blueberry cake kiwi mousse fruit cake orange cake brownie burfi  everything was so well done
all in all do visit the place on a saturday to have a gala time

by invite",5,
"few days back ended up at komatose where they were having grill and chill on saturday night we sat outside where there was live music with light winds and good company along with melodious music the setting was perfect to unwind the food that i tried included pav bhaji paneer tikka tandoori vegetables and corn special mention to the dessert spread that had kiwi mousse fruit cake brownie blueberry cake orange pastry to name a few
highly recommended for a good time with good food",4,
cool place to visit large screen available for ipl tip accepts deals on little app and also they provide peanuts pnot sure about the weekend rush,5,
"ambiance is really good and it is very close to financial district restaurant staff is very helpful and polite i visited this place many times for corporate lunches you will get verity of options for lunch food is tasty and less spicy lunch cost around 1000 per person

once i visited this place for dinner and got to know that they serve very few options for dinner buffet dinner buffet is usually for their resident guests and it cost around 700 per person though you can enjoy a la carte restaurant also have full bar available

every day 4pm to 8pm is happy hour zomato gold option is not available",4,
these stars are just for the food and drinks i just do not like the service and attitude of the staff or rather just our luck that we encountered the same person twice almost threw the order on the table when prepared even the food he served was without any accompaniments that were supposed to be there drinks are goodfood is okzero stars for the service,3,
been to this place on saturday music is awesome ambience too gud liked the food also specially the pizza nd dj is the best part of it dnt forget to be there on saturday night as dj deep plays some of his awesome tracks which makes u go even more mad,4,
good place to spend time with friends and colleagues dj is great and loved the bar structureservice was quick and staff were quite interactive would like to appreciate anmol the bar staff,4,
the ambience is nice but overall experience on a ladies night was not satisfyingi ordered double deck pizza with liitthe food was deliciousthe music was good,3,
after a very long time came across a place where trending bollywood numbers are also played the food is great the music may be loud if you wish to have a good discussion with your folks but overall a nice experience,4,
"for vegetarians
i feel place is definitely overrated not much options available taste is kind of ok not great definitely price do not go well with the food
i doubt zomato ratings seriously",2,
"komatose sigh 
i had high expectations by seeing the rating but unfortunately the menu place and the crowd was very dissapointing
we like the fried mozzarella could not find anything better or unusual 
well this is not a separate restaurant they use one single restaurant by two names
only what made me give a 3 ratings was the live music bollywood beautiful voice of the singer
sorry komatose 
aditi",3,
"well next to jonathans kitchen is this place to down a few
komatose is a good crowd puller with plenty of weekend party groups and people from nearby it companies
the team at the bar does a phenomenon job their interaction with guests is over the top no wonder i heard of people visiting this place almost every day of the year

also from my experience this is one of those few places where the sound acoustics are so well designed that its loud yet comfortable you will not come out with a sore throat

the food comes from its sibling jonathans kitchen so we know it can never go wrong about the drinks well what could go wrong with them   and oh  did i mention the cheese chilli toast its different try it

the outdoor cabanas can seat about 8  10 people each wonderful for the evenings

great music with shows on specific days of the week

draft is served but tends to vanish quickly  

this place is a full package

"this is a perfect place to hit after day is long work it has enigmatic and soothing ambience

the service is quick the gorund floor is a seating near bar counter and then there is first floor with a big screen for live streaming all in all a rocking place",4,
been to this place and wonderful place to hangout with friends food is amazing as usualgot a great offer from little application and thoroughly satisfied,5,
best place to be for saturday nights these guys nailed it when it comes to their package my friend suggested this place for dinner tonight and i simply cannot ignore their outdoor grills more over they have dj at the bar and live music outdoor this gives you options to choose cudos to the bartenders they made our day even better,5,
friendly staff good live music and decent food you can go enjoy the live music with decent food and drinks but for sure not a place for a great party this place lacks life in it you get depressing feeling if live music is not playing,2.5,
nice place for classy the place was small but it looks cute one thing is they dont have separate washroom for bar by the way i love this place i want to visit again,4.5,

their happy hours are good you save a hell lot money at that time

awesome place to hang out with friends specially the bar and the bartenders anmol and asif really amazing cocktail maker food also really good and value for money awesome crowd overall must visit if you want to hang out with friends for drinks food and dance,5,
"this place is located in khajaguda it used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste quantity and pricing i used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week

food is no doubt goodtheir soups starters dal makhani etc however there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden

prices have been almost doubled  i used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs i believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50 is really a good decision with no changes in ambience  i believe their main usp was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and moti mahal have lower prices and better ambience

with hike in prices customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience fancy cutlery on the table  well decorated tables  and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use well dressed waiters etc

hope the management would rethink",3,
"this review was long due located on the khajaguda road this restaurant claims to be part of the gachibowli cluster and when i asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of gachibowli and therefore technically they are in gachibowli the place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction

coming to the food we went for the gulaabi chaap after checking on google unfortunately this is the only place in india that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it simply put it was amazing mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce it gave a heavenly feeling next on the list was the chicken momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos i had in manali i hope some day they make mutton momos as well

butter chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the malai warki paratha it was soft and was melting in the mouth with the butter chicken seemed like a match made in heaven much said about the main course we went for their version of special biryani as is known from my reviews i do not eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for it had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the biryani rice the taste was good and to my liking our vegetarians friends were enjoying their daal makhni and paneer butter masala which was again good and their veg biryani as per them was equally good

thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by the large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the ipl on the large screen they offered us a 20 discount and another 10 on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer thank you aromas11six for being such a good host and an amazing food we shall be back again",5,
i have ordered chinese nonveg combo from this place it is basically veg fried rice with chicken manchurian gravythe foods aroma was awesome however the vegetables were undercooked and spoilt the taste of the food however i really liked the foodit was flavourfulwill definitely order from this place again,3,
the location is not so okay i found that most of the people werent there the quantity of the chicken biryani we ordered was a lot the chicken starter is also tasty must try biryani but prices should be reduced,4,
"i did not like this place at all this restaurant do not match zomato gold standards first thing  the price and ambience do not match at all this place looks like a shady dhaba from highway but prices for food compares to ohris restaurants

even if we ignore prices  taste and services are worst that i have encountered in any zomato gold restaurant

this place do not deserve 4 rating totally disappointed

deepank",1,
food is over rated and service should be improve a lotfood item cost does not match provided taste over all bad experiencemanagement has to look into these issues,2,
"what you people are doing
two times i get wrong items from you
why you people are sending wrong items today i given
order
1 mushroom masala
2 paneer butter masala
but you people are send biriyani and sum curry",2,
worst food 150 ml coke costs 60 worst serving and very arrogant attitude avoid visiting this place manager is not available all the time,1,
the quality of food they are offering has degraded i was the one who wrote good feedback about the restaurant once and was a frequent visitor but now because of poor quality offered twice i stopped going there,3,
have visited this place few times last year this is a decent dinein joint the food you get here is a normal indochinese food which any chinese restaurant would serve if you want vfm go there and dinein have always felt that the quantity of takeaways are less than dinein the picture is a quantity you get for 320 bucks dish,3,
"i order from this place all the time never visited though
food 45
price 35 overpriced
i really liked there paneer biryani and all starters",3,
i ordered a dish which is not there in the menu there were kind enough to make it for me paneer was soft and gravy was rich thank you we enjoyed it will definitely order again,5,
"must try
food is awesome in terms of taste and quality and quantity alsoaromas special chicken briyani must try item in menu of you are biryani lover
only one thing service is very slow because of love kitchen2 hours for lunch or dinner
place is small but good",5,
food tastes good here but when you see surroundings around kitchen and wash area it was horrible cockroaches mice and lots and lots of dust i understand this place is for online orders but not for dine in given the fact that people dont get to see this unhygienic atmosphere,2,
went for a birthday partyit is a small restaurant with simple ambiancefood is really good and you must try it oncegot to know the story behind the name and its pretty interesting and inspiringstaff is politely and courteous,5,
the prices are hiked and then discount is offered basically the discount provided by the restaurant is kind of a fraud and they try to fool people,1,
a beautiful calm place to settle down and have food liked the ambience had ordered mutton rogan josh kadhai paneer butter nan hot n sour soup must say they have really maintained a great taste for whatever they cook loved all d dishes we had ordered mutton rogan josh was d best till now i had in entire hyderabad kadhai paneer was surely an authentic kadhai paneer with whole spice taste coming from d dish soup was also upto d mark and also liked the behaviour of the staff really well behaved will surely revisit the place again,5,
nice experience overall we had dinner 2 times and ordered online once the food was good dal makhni was specially very good and the place is very peaceful too,5,
"this place started as a great place initially but in recent times the quality and quantity have been reduced
one of their best dishes  sarson ka phool is the best example of this category
you need to go back to your basics else you will loose the customers slowly",3,
"i have been ordering from this place for a long time they are fantastic in terms of following any specific instructions you might have when you order via swiggy or ubereats the food is as described there is no overdose of spices or oil the menu is varied i have tried chinese and tandoori dishes from here both vegetarian and nonvegetarian this is my first choice when we want to dine in my favourite dishes from here are chicken lababdaar kafuli and chicken afghani

i took away one star from the review as there are rare issues with quality control like tandoori kababs were once a little burnt",4,
"this place is tough to find due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place do not go by the pictures
food is average few items very bad mainly their special biryani oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible
it is not so happening place
their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity

p s they are good for delivery yet if u can skip there are good places nearby",3,
great taste and always have been consistent with the quality of the food been served zomato gold members can enjoy 11 and its worth it for the price you pay and the quality of food they serve,5,
i have ordered today veg cantonese pan fried noodles both noodles and soup are not at all good noodles not cooked well soup has too much of corn floor and unable to eat total parcel went to garbage tin,1,
"food ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes kafuli shaam savera and naans everything was spiced appropriately kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet a tangy taste of tomato gravy

service a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members

ambience it has indoor and outdoor seating both we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played ambience is overall very average

value for money great it is actually cheaper than we expected for the quantity and quality of food it served",4,
35 by me the food was quite good 455 for taste we ordered paneer achari tikka and paneer butter masala both of which were quite good nothing to complain about the butter rotis were a little overcooked but ok service was also good points deducted for cleanliness as the outside area was infested with fleas so was not able to get the dhaba style experience with benches and lanterns which made the outside experience desirable the inside seating was good tough,4,
"tasty food but expect less quantity compared to price
it is on the middle of kajaguda to nanakramguda not crowded and big very small restaurant",3,
"ambience not great by seeing photos we expected more out of it but it did not match our expectations it was dark and sort of out of order too
rating  35

food we reached here just to have sizzlers as we wanted it and could find only some on the list being this one of them we took sizzler again it was not what we thought of it was just about fine then we ordered panner tikka and something in non veg starters starters were good they grilled properly baked properly proper taste we ordered some curries and naan again the main course was just about fine not great overall we only liked starters here
rating  35

service it was bit slow we had to wait for quite some time for getting our order at one point we thought that maybe they are outsourcing the food also 
rating  35

overall place is bit hard to find and food it is not that great it is decent for you to explore but not the first choice",3,
"review no 514 
 
in my recent visit to hyderabad i was introduced to aromas11six while the name sounds interesting but i was not able to find the reason behind their name 

our teams in hyderabad have been ordering food from here for team events etc for quite some time and hence when we ordered food from here i was keen to find out how they fared 
 
here is what we ended up ordering over a few days from aromas11six 
 
gosht rogan josh what a beautiful preparation of spices and meat the meat in specific was cooked very well and the spices were also within moderation i usually get scared with the spice level in such dishes but aromas11six got it absolutely right with this dish 
 
butter rotis even when they were delivered to us at home and as well in the office they were warm and soft nothing beats such a meal on an unusual cold hyderabad winter evening 
 
paneer butter masala the quality of the paneer used was excellent the quantity of the gravy and the paneer pieces were adequate i loved the consistency of the gravy and the balance in the spices used  
 
dal fry again in many instances i have seen how it can go easily wrong with this humble dish thank you for serving this up well  

paneer biryani on of the days i could not have nonveg food and ended up ordering their paneer biryani and it was filling to the core the quality of the rice and preparation was nice thank you for not being stingy with the paneer 

see if you can check for some good combos on popular food app portals that way you can try this great dish and club it with something else as well 
 
price in line with the competition they have tie ups with some of the popular food apps and hence sometimes we end up getting a good deal 
 
service they have ensure we always got our orders within the stipulated time in spite of the rush in the orders especially during dinner time 
 
ambience we have only done take aways from here and hence going to leave this neutral 

here is the final ratings basis my experience at aromas11six i am going to hold back a bit on the ratings because they have depth in their menu and i would want to try them out more and perhaps revisit my ratings again in the near future

food 45 
price 45 
service 45  
ambience 35 our review has been based only on home delivery and hence keeping this neutral 
 
overall 45 implied rating of 4 on zomato",4,
i wish i had a 0 star option for thiswe visited for the first time and it was a very unprofessional way of having food there the service was although fast but the food was terrible we ordered apollo fish which was not at all worth eating and the mushroom starter itself gave a unwilligness to eat the main course we ordered was murg and veg kolhapuri which absolutely had no salt in it the restaurant couldnt even provide lemons to us even after requesting multiple times whereas they had cut lemons for finger bowl a must no to this place,1,
"if you are bored of these pizza burgers  biryani mandis  i think you should definitely visit this place
food is really good 45
ambience 35
butt  you have to wait for a lotttttt of time 
other than that everything is good
i would suggest to go with north indian dishes  they are really yummy ",4,
the ambiance of this place does not justify the price severely over priced only with gold is it ok would prefer if they thought of their service and ambience and try and compare with other restaurants out there,1,
horrible first time experience i would never suggest ordering or going to this restaurant they have absolutely no regards for the customer satisfaction i ordered food from this restaurant and after first accepting my order they go ahead and decline it after an hour when i called the restaurant they say that it was the zomato delivery guy declined it i called zomato and they say that the restaurant never responded to their call and so they had to cancel it i called the delivery guy and he said that the restaurant told him that some one else picked up the order i am not sure who is at fault here but i had a horrendous experience overall so i am not going to order or go to this restaurant again and wouldnt recommend it to anyone for their pathetic customer service,1,
i did not visit the restaurant yet but ordered chicken biriyani here but that is not a biriyani that is a just cooked basmati rice with chicken 65 they are calling it chicken biryani patheticwill visit restaurant onceheard otherwise about sea food here and update my review then,1,
"i ordered mutton biryani and it was very badworst quality mutton biryani you can eat  the pieces were all leftovers small bits and it felt he gave all leftover  on telling him to replacereataurant told let them check it but then nothing was replaced  one should not prefer this restaurant as quality is now degraded  extremely bad and horrible service ",1,
its my updated review  first time it was not good experience wrt staff but we opted this place again due to good food  they improved alot wrt service and staff response  food anyways is great here,5,
very bad i did not expect this quality and taste,1,
"the food is great but it took almost 45 min to se
rveambiance is good zomato gold is accepted address is pretty simple tandoori chicken is very tasty ",3,
been a regular customer of this place the quality and taste has gone from wow to very bad had the worst biryani recently tasteless half of the chicken was uncooked and other half stale,1,
"ordered chicken kolhapuri via swiggy and the experience was top notch  the gravy is to die for spicy succulent

this is the best and spiciest chicken kolhapuri i had in last 2 years

it appears it is slow cooked and boneless chicken is then dipped in the gravy

the aroma was fantastic and was feeling great having this curry

i can still feel it in my mouth kudos to the chef

taste 55
quantity 45

will definitely try other curies from this place",5,
"food  amazing food had chefs special kofta curry with peas pulao it was the best i had after so long time it is must try place for food

ambiance okay not great outside sitting is under construction

parking  due to road construction it was not good but manageable

services very good services and staff is very friendly",4,

"were there for my friend is birthday party as the place is nearer to her it is a small place with around 67 tables with only two stewards service is good as the place is not so crowded at the time we went

had manchow soup which can be much better lipta mushroom is not that great mushroom is not fresh there is no crispness in the crispy corn egg biryani is good overall not satisfied with the food much even pricing is little high in comparison with the taste and quality",2,
i ordered the aroma is special chicken biryani and it would have been better if it was not soo saltyplease do look into this next time,1,
starters were good the main course lacked salt and a bit of lemon juice we ordered the palak paneer i have had food here once before and it was amazing then so this time it was a slight disappointment last time i had the chicken tikka which was really amazing,3,
"totally overrated
just avoid this place unless you wanna loose your money for a cheap quality food
there is only one guy who does all the service and you have to wait long for your turn to come up
and the place looks like some forbidden house",1,
"the ambience was good we 12 ppl went there for dinner some of us ordered biriyani some had kulcha nun with kadai murg for starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks starter was delicious but they did not provide salad and sufficient chatney for biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed they told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes but the rice was sour with biriyani the gravy they provided did not have any salt may b they tried to compensate one of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 rs
and about the service it was good till we pay the bill frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app but they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept atlast though they agreed overall we werent satisfied at all",2,
"best place to eat near my office
food is really tasty the staffs are polite

the owner himself is very friendly

the service is a bit slow
the tandoor items are really nice and their special biryani is really good the best thing is that it will not cost you much
not at all overpriced",5,
i ordered kadai veg and methi malai paratha both had a lot of soil particles and we could not eat either of them on my previous experiences i really appreciated the food and highly rated the restaurant for the same dishes that disappointed me this time we ended up ordering from somewhere else since the restaurant did not act on my prompt complaint,1,
"nice little place  hard to locate though this is near to lanco hills in manikonda the food here is really good and the staff is very attentive the ambience is not so great but good for small family dining experience this place had gold and we had ordered one starter one biryani and one kulcha all tasted good and the bill was around 450 bucks 

can try it if you want someplace light on budget",4,
"one of the most underrated restaurants some of the dishes are a must try like gulaabi chaap  reasonable rates

ambience35 taste 55 service45 value for money55
overall experience55",5,
ordered schezwan chicken via swiggy last night the taste is bland neither good nor bad just okay the quantity is way less for a 210 rupees dish,3,
"have visited this place today and the food was really awesome
ordered chilly prawn  tandoori drum stick and chicken biryaniprawns and biryani were excellent and drum sticks were good
if you are looking for taste within budget  this is a must try place
food  455
ambience  35
service  355",4,
"a place one can miss easily because of the location but a must try
i would say the ambience could have been better but the food supercedes the ambience
the broccoli  paneer corn kebab  babycorns tandoori chicken prawns were amazing
i would say stuffed paneer tikka and paneer butter masala could be better
the mutton gravy was pretty good too along with chicken biryani
among the chapatis  malai methi roti was really really nice",4,
"went to this place just because it is listed on zomato gold and i must say i am pretty impressed with the whole experience over there we have ordered paneer majestic nothing extraordinary about it was good later we have tried bhami goreng veg kolhapuri butter naan and murg biryani bhami goreng had very unique different flavourtaste which i liked same thing with the curry and naan both of them were really good special mention to murg biryani it was amazing

coming to prices they were pretty reasonable

this is the place you should be if you are treating your friends full meals without burning your pocket everything we ordered was tasty and good quantity,4,
best food thanku,5,

"i ordered subz biryani paneer butter masala taste of both the foods were great except that vegetables in biryani were partly cooked which makes me to rate 4 ",4,
"a must go placefood here is delicious and worthybiryani is must try
we ordered salt n pepper friescrispy cornbiryani and chicken salt n pepper is truely delicious",5,
"so i have not tried most of their dishes but what i have tried is the chinese cuisine and i must say its really nice do try out their veg fried rice as well chilli chicken dry or chilli paneer dry these dishes have been pretty amazing whenever i have been there so do try 

ps you may follow me on my instagram page by the name of simbassister for more interesting food feeds ",4,
nice good,5,
"if you have no value for money then this restaurant is good to waste your money reason for giving 3 is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends but we nonveg guys were totally disappointed for nonveg curries it is got no taste at all chilli chicken gravy was like saucysaucy no spicy at all butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be it tasted like wheat flour and not maida

service good
taste below average
ambiance good
cost high",3,
very tasty biryani,5,
very very bad the food was not of good taste and quality as well it is like throwing money in water just some fancy names they have kept for dishes but the standard are not even like for petty shops in fact after having the food both me and my husband have got food infection pls close ur shop instead of making people sick,1,
happy,5,
"situated a little away from the main road aromas serves quite good indian as well as continental dishes including chinese and thai food the cost of all the dishes are at the lower side as compared to the other restaurants it has an average interior with both indoor and outdoor sitting though the service here is not so good but the food covers it all i really liked the taste of the north indian food that it served it has true north indian flavour i loved gulaabi chaap which is a betroot kebab lehsuni dhaniya murg  sholay kebab  malai warki paratha kastori kebab are the other tasty and aswumm items that i tried undoubtedly it comforted my taste and was happily back home ",5,
worst prawns biryani i have ever had curd rice is too badrice not at all properly boiledfelt too bad might this restaurant has fake reviews,1,
delivery was on time and much aprisiated executive atitude zomato just awesome,5,
na,5,
gobi manchuria is not soo gud as expected,2,
"manchuria was good and so was paneerquantity can be little more
overall it was good",4,
"great food
i am happy",5,
"starters were good and especially tandoori items were best of the menu
curries were just okay and biryani is a very a big disappointmentnever try it service is good and staff is very courteous",3,
too spicy,3,
went for a north indian dinner the place is a little out of way the ambience is okay it looked more like a college hang out place there were only 2 people managing the counter and the tables however the food was really good decent place for lunch or dinner and easy on the pocket as well especially if you have zomato gold,4,
ordered tawa aloo paratha veg manchurian and badami kheer paratha is below average veg manchurian is ok no badam flavor in kheer but it is a rice kheer,2,
food packaging and providing sufficient packets of raita according to the order,3,
had ordered hunan chicken starter received gravy,3,
the food is too salty i will tweet about this bad food,1,
they forgot in egg fried rice,1,
good but double swipe has been done,5,
super excited,5,
great on time order delivered,5,
"items are cool ",2,
"it is at 6th floor of act boutique building that the entrance gate is just opposite to karachi bakery the building is little bit inside once you get there u will find a cafe on the ground floor
the place is cool not so noisy spacious and hygiene service is fast they have seating arrangement in two ways 1 chair and table 2 carpet seating like traditional

we ordered mutton haleem and chicken fahm mandi half for two people there was no chicken haleem

the mutton haleem was delicious i feel this is the best haleem i had taste 55

the chicken fahm mandi was delicious too the masala was perfect but people who do not like masala may not be pleased much they give good amount of chicken taste55",5,
i am new to hyderabad heard of the hyderabadi haleem here is very famous so ordered haleem from this restaurant it was a disastrous experience please dont try any kind of haleem here i have not tried any other dish here and now i am hesitant to order any other dish from here after having haleem here,1,
"situated at the heart of the town this is by far the best place to lay your hands on arabian and yemeni dishes in the city of nawabs with stiff competition from more than a dozen other restaurants in the area the prices are average but the quality is exceptional the ambience of the place is exceptional and with adequate lights which are extremely soothing to the eyes food apart the whole setup of the restaurant creates a unique aura for all food lovers

note  plz do try the bbq chicken mandi and the juicy chicken mandi they are the best items from the whole menu

in frame  bbq chicken mandi  chicken juicy mandi",5,
i had been here with my office colleagues for lunch we order malai chicken and mix chicken mandi i earlier had mandi at different places in hyderabad but this place was awesome they had nice interiors with seating arrangements if you are not comfortable seating on the rug then you can sit on table and chair for food i would rate it 5 for amazing taste quantity and for that arabian food feel we order 2 mandi and we all 8 of us were so full and started feeling sleepy as it was lunch time we had to build some courage and go to officewill be visiting again to try some mutton mandi,5,
"chicken nuggets must try herebbq chicken mandi is too gudbut ambience is not too gudand not so neat
but itsgud only for taste foodwaiting time is too high bettween 810",4,
have always been a fan of the shawarma of this place therefore wanted to try the mandi as well but was utterly disappointed with the quality of rice being served by no means it seemed to be mandi rice it was more like pulao rice considering the price that i paid the quality was no match for it mandi rice is never sticky but in this case it was kindly look into the image and you will understand,1,
i like this place for shawarma but mandi was pathetic it contained pulao rice full sticky no cashews really not the kind of mandi i was expecting from this place really pathetic mandi,1,
"i came to know this place through my colleague we went here for a team lunch
and this place is one of the best ideas to have team lunches as mandi is specially a platter for 2 and more people can eat together
ambience normal and okay
service  fast and good
food taste  quite good and worthy
ordered chicken wings mandi and barbeque chicken mandi chicken is tender and tasty rice is flavourful and quantity is great
veg mandi is okay but not so tasty
bas bousa 35  i am trying for the 1st time taste is great but its quite dry
overall xperience is great for huge teams",4,
we went for my birthday dinner here there ambience is beautiful to say the least the stuff is quite courteous we had chicken mandi kebabs and kaddu ka kheer although kaddu ka kheer was a bit too liquid for us we loved our food this place is not really pocket friendly but totally worth the money,5,
i tried chicken mandi made in arabian there will be badam and kissmiss garnished on that which is open ur taste buds chicken wings and kurbaani ka meeta are also lovely dishes to try when ever you visit that restaurant,4,
"we were 2 friends wanted to eat some mandi i know some is not the right word when it comes to mandi with that huge plate and all so yum yum tree is a great place to eat mandi it was around 2o clock in noon when we visitedthe place is very calm and not on main road but its easy to find
ambience is spot on arabic songs played are romantic the guy who served us had a smile on his face all the time he is serving us nothing to complain about the place at the same time nothing to praise too
we ordered bbq chiken mandi and grill fish
grill fish was oki dint like it much but my friend loved it she likes fish may be thats why
bbq chiken mandi was amazing i can place them in top 5 mandis in hyderabad trust me with a lot of mandi places its a tough to be on top 5bbq chiken pieces wer juicy and very flavour fullthey give you mayonise and chutney to go along prices are very pocket friendlyyou can visit with family friends or girlfriend its a perfect place for mandi definitely going again",4,
a gem and must try hyderabad restaurant the ambiance to sit relaxed and enjoy with friends plus the unmatched pleasure of getting high on briyani i tried the mutton mandi and it was extremely tender and flavourful,5,
the place gives you a feeling like you are having food at a royal arab resta the food here is aptly cooked but the required seasonings are not providedfried onion which are main in a mandi and also i have seen them filling tap water in the bottles and serving the same as bottled water  so watch out at last you can rate the food at 45  seasonings 25 ambience 15 at last it is a great place to go with family and friends,3,
"perfect mandi place ordered for 2 and had to stuff ourselves for completing the whole plate 
45 ppl and order one and eat upto full
tasty chicken 
visit with frnds and family ",5,
"the most important factor which i take into consideration is service
and if they are rude do not give any importance to customers they do not deserve anything
giving 2 stars just for the ambience",2,
mandi is good prices are affordable with generous serving we tried fish mandi and it was yummy only thing they need to fix is furniture as it looks worn out,4,
best place for all mandi fans nevwr miss their saalan and miyo and with no forgetting their extra fried onions it is best for giving treats budget friendly parties,5,
have been here once the staff was courteous and very friendly overall the theme was perfect and sets the arabic mood i think they can work a bit more on offering more choices felt that the choices were limited apart from the mandi it is known for limited veg options too,3,
ordered grilled tandoori and to my surprise i have got 2 neck pieces for one chickenmust be an alien such a pathetic taste of food that i am never going to order from this joint again,1,
"i just wonder how people praise the food and service
maybe the day was different for me but i was really very dissapointed with the service they had given we asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi i hate such late servings
mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great instead i find it better at other places

ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants however the choice of music could have been better

overall i would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate",3,
the place was really a new experience for me food was good enoughambience was good resembling the arabic theme staff was goodone can visit here to experience arabic style of foodrates are i think above average,4,
this place is absolutely amazing from the classic mandi to their other dishes the food here gives you a taste you can never forget tue ambience just adds to the beauty that this place already is the waiters were very polite and helpful loving this place a lil more with every visit,5,
this is a small place on the 6th floor of a hotel not a lot of options for veggies the mandi is brilliant we were about 10 of us and got a chance to try a lot of starters and they were all good the flag bearer at this place is the mandi you need atleast 5 folks mop it service is good and the food is not very heavy on the stomach do not miss it,5,
awesome food been there with my office colleagues for lunch and had ordered half veg thali and falafel the half plate is enough for 3 people at least the food was yum suitable for the name and lot of crowd would love to visit again,4,
the place do not have mutton though they have it in menu chicken mandi is ok not that greatambience in contrast is great music is too loud to have conservation in lunch,2,
had gone out with friends for a midnight craving and had the mandi it was served on a huge plate and the seating was so perfect for us to help comfortably finish off the entire dish the rice was very flavorful and we were able to taste the ghee and cognitive milk in every bite a great place for a feast,4,
"the place is a bit isolated but the food and ambience is quite good even one of the best place to have the arabian mandi give a visit for sure i would say
fahm mandi  less spicy
barbaque chicken mandi if you do not mind having a bit spicy my personal favourite it is",3,
"my first mandi dining ever but as the name says the food was yumm

we ordered half special veg mandi and chicken bbq mandi the mandi is more than enough to fill three people and the cost is reasonable

the arabian theme ambience looked warm and inviting the add on point was the seating arrangement",4,
"this branch is in one of the interior areas in the hitech city

ambiance the ambiance is rich and has good feel and better ambiance compared to the other branches

food we had the mixed mandi platter which is like 1k but really huge with good variety of chicken grill tandoori mutton french fries etc
the rice is also fine and is accompanied by good amount of fried onion and cashew nuts and other sides like mayo and tomato chutney

we also had the teriyaki burger which was not upto the mark of the long lost taste of the original yum yum tree

overall

ambience 910
food  8510
value for money 910",4,
"arabic feel

service at yum yum tree gachibowli is average as they take more time to serve starters",3,
"the only branch which i liked though it is quite farit has a rooftop too which is beautiful and opens after 6 or 7serves delicious food in a reasonable pricestaff was very friendly they only serve 2 desserts and sadly khunafa is not one of them we had baklava which was not that goodit would be great if they expand their menu a little more

once we have ordered chicken special cheese shawarma from this restaurant and it was very yummy so today out of the blue me and my husband thought of trying their mandi also we have already heard a lot about mandi in their restaurant we went for lunch and there was waiting we waited for 15mins to get arabian seat after having mandi i can only say one thing try at once but keep in mind its a good place for nonvegeterians,5,
"good place to spend a weekend it is a beautiful place with delicious food
liked the hospitality of the staff
recommend every one to visit at least once",5,
it is too good for sitting and the dessert was awesome and it is good time for family to have anice time and the staff is polite and good the environment is pleas  itsyummy,5,
"as the name says if you want to checkout the yummy arabian food in hyderabad then this your place

the ambience is very spacious and resembles the arabic style of interior decor and seating this also has camel prototype placed in the entrance

if you are a hater of sea food you will start loving it after eating the grill fish tikka from here

food we tried here

chicken bbq tikka
grill fish tikka
chicken arabian mix mandi

all the 3 items that we tried here are the best of it is kind chicken bbq tikka is the best of the grilled chicken that i have tried before grill fish tikka comes with a single complete grilled fish without any bones it just melts in your mouth and if you try it with white mayonnaise it tastes the best

chicken arabian mix mandi comes with arabian mix grill platter it is comes with a combination of chicken tikka chicken wings grill fish tikka chicken bbq tikka and mutton

this was the best mandi i ever had it has rice cooked in arabian style with kaju kishmish and fried onions sprinkled all over the rice this combination of rice with grilled nonveg tikka gives you a foodgasm and also it easily serves for 4 to 5 people if you are on a very high appetite

service here is really good and cost is reasonable for all the items so if you are planning to try arabian food in this city of nizam then do try this place",4,
"tasty food mandi and deserts both veg and non veg
everyone can hop on wd family n friends and parcel options also available gooddddddddddddddddd",5,
the food quality has gone down compared to its initial opening period the rice is too bland and the chicken dishes are a bad excuse for being a lazy chef,2,
visited yyt with my family for friday dinner was longing to have mandi for long the restaurant is located close to qcity amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall the dcor is simple yet beautiful generous staff we ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece it was more than sufficient needless to say it was heavenly would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa good place for gettogether request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and diningseating area,3,
"visited with my friend in weekend and it is my 1st visit to this food court firstly ambience was impressive so that i had started taking selfies coming to service just ok
and food taste was not up to the mark ",3,
very disappointed with the food that i ordered from yum yum tree today the quantity of the rice for the juicy mutton marag was less i ordered full and there were only bones in the mutton no flesh at all felt cheated for the money i paid shawarma was good i do not think i will try the food from here once again,2,
"this was my first visit to yum yum tree restaurant and food was ok we were three people and ordered sheesh tawook starter  chicken bbq mandi overall good experience

service 45
ambiance 355",3,
very nice place food location to hangout with friends very tasty arabian food loved it special food mutton juicy mandi yummy tasty,5,
i celebrated my birthday with my bunch of gang food is awesome especially fish is too good must try and mandi too smooth and tasty so guys must visit place in hyderabad for foodies,5,
the best yum yum tree branch till date the chicken zinger burger is a must try a rooftop restaurant makes it best to hangout  the ambience is great,5,
excellent thank you,5,
this branch of  yum yum tree is on the gowlidoddi road a little further from the q city building this place is known for the mandi they serve but i thought of trying something other than mandi and so i  ordered the chicken jumbo burger which had a generous amount of chicken and mayonnaise the burger tasted good and it was quite filling this place is not harsh on your pocket,4,
wonderful food and ambiance best place for a family  the food is exotic the staff courteous value for money my family had a very good time,5,
"visited yum yum tree with my family for dinner i wanted to try mandi since so long and the long wait ended here this arabian food joint is located in financial district gachibowli in a gated community with ample of parking space the interiors are great and food is to the point as the name suggests  yum yum both the quality  quantity you get is amazing for a decent price also the staff is highly courteous and hospitable


food i tried 
bbq chicken burger
teriyaki chicken burger
chicken tandoori roll
chicken bbq mandi with extra rice


i highly  highly recommend this place to all my fellow followers ",5,
love the shawarmasturkish special shawarmas is the best order is quick tried mutton fried mandinot worth the hype food quality is to the point,4,
the outlet looks good the service is excellent food is fine its not true to its cuisine its not true arabic food shawarma is not what you expect it is more like a roll if you want a true authentic arabian food i suggest you to go to some other place,2,
"as the name so is the food
the food is really yum as mandi is the most popular food we tried two options

special veg mandi and chicken bbq mandi

both were extremely delicious and mouth melting

especially the aloo tikki slices on the veg one gave an amazing crunch

the service is decent and staff is super supportive

cheers a must try",4,
the best mandi i ever had till date the flavours the richness in taste was amazing had chicken bbq mandi they also serve burgers and taste one the mayo was very sweet which many people would not like it,5,
best mandi i have ever had well served food good cooking that it feels very light even if you eat a whole medium mandi ambiance is not bad,4,
food is cold n not even tasty,2,
"awesome arabian food joint  your search for mandi should end here for good calm and serene place on the 6th floor has ample parking space as it is within gated community went out for family dinner menu is not huge but has something to satisfy everyone is taste buds provided you are a non vegetarian for starters tried the fish grill and lebanese juicy chicken it was one of the best fish dishes i have tasted in town i am particular about my fish not much bones or fins should not
smell bad and should be cooked well all 3 criteria was a tick with a wonderful flavour and the accompanying mayo sauce was just perfect high standards set with first dish expectations were only growing as we waited for lebanese chicken  it was just juicy  cooked well and was fresh and tasted great so a 5 on 5 for starters now moving to the the attraction of the day the mandi it was authentic middle east preparation with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments ordered juicy mutton mandi mutton quality was above par mandi was great  if you are a spice lover mandi is not for you ended the day with baklawa which was usual
recommend must try place for mandi",5,
"not worth the hype created the service is not worth the cost many dishes from the menu was not available saying we are not serving indian food when ordered cold drink they gave 500ml bottle and paper cup for a restaurant of this level you expect proper glasses for drinks the taste was okay but the rice quality was not what i get in paradise or other biryani place
my first mandi experience in hyderabad was not good",2,
"food is delicious chicken bbq mandi mutton fry mandi and chicken burger are awesome good ambiance and service
owner and staff are courteous",4,
"arabian touch to a sumptuous feast a great place for team outings and the mandis will make your team work totally worth it good taste in food and great ambience service could be improved a notch the mandis will fill up to 3 people and is worth the penny courteous staff and great seating arrangement best visited in the night 

ps do not get flabbergasted by the looks of the mandi

personal favourites chicken bbq mandi mutton juicy mandi fairly good shawarmas sp chicken cheese shawarma",3,
mixed mandiso far the best one i had ideal for 4 to 6 people who r foodiesambience too gudservice neee to be improved seating good enough loved it try for the parties with ur friends,4,
they did not provide any ketchup nor tissues also with the order ordered chicken cheese shawarma which is not tasty and the fries provided are not fresh but very soft,1,
"went on a sat noon food is ok type not that tasty mayonese is sweet  wtf   mutton is not tasty chicken starter was crispy  reason for 2   i did not like the desert also

verdict  not recommend skip",2,
"the best part about this place is ambiance and seating arrangement very unique in style and an enjoyable experience especially when visited with friendsfamily
we have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa

people go here to have mandi the dish that they are meant for we too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters chicken tikka and chicken wings of which the former was palatable
we had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food five of us were unable to finish it off rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated
the feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing
their service deserves a special mention they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise
overall this is a must visit to have mandi",4,
"this is an arabian themed restaurant and is located near qcity gachibowli and is exclusively known for its mandi 

they have different varieties of mandi and the restro is designed very well with eye catching ambience

taste is quite different from other places of hyderabad where we enjoy biryani but yes the biryani tasted equally good

for my surprise veg biryani is served with french fries and some patties which tasted good as well

honestly i have been to this place couple of times in frequent events 1st two times i really loved the mandi but last two times it was just ok ok have you guys sacrificed your quality or it was the odd timing both the time i went i feel the taste should be same all the time specially the rice in the mandi use to be tastier than chicken or mutton but now its just ok ok type dont do this guys you have one of the best for mandis in hyderabad please maintain your quality,2,
onions were not given,1,
food packing is bad,2,
"mandi rice had a nice flavour to it although having tasted the mandi in arab countries too i feel that it could have been a bit softer the chicken was spicy and more indianised
lebanese grill was good",4,
a very friendly welcoming place to spend quality time with foodie friendsthe food was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation very pleasing everything was handled with efficiency and attention was given to every detail and a big thanx to mr sonu for hosting us soo well,4,

we went there early evening it was calm and peaceful music was soft food was good but the main course quantity was less beer tasted well service was fast and professional  recommend for quick dinners,4,
"was here for a club party

so this place has an amazing ambience with dim lighting well equipped furniture  a large lcd screen  the light music just makes it perfect during a cricket match

well coming to food i opted for a veg buffet the starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread  ghee idly

we had enough dishes in the main course  there were mocktails being served whenever asked raspberry tasted the best

deserts werent that great vanilla scoops were just fine

overall it seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd  also alone yes for those cricket maniacs you can just get yourself a beer  relax

either ways it seemed at its best with proper space lights music  yaa privacy

i would rate

i always go this place with my friends wen eva i get timethere collection of beers is just amazingambience is really good with a nice viewif u stay near gachibowli i highly recommend this place,5,
"just make sure why you are going there if food it would be a 3 ratingyes comparatively cheaper buffet in near by restaurants though and if it drinks it would hang near 4 their varieties in drinks get that for them
place is good in ambiance but total inside so not a roof top or garden you can enjoy the game days well than other days
and yes a good value for your money",3,
"i am a musician and i perform at this place because the place has a positive vibe peaceful atmosphere
the most important thing the staff is way more humble and down to earth they greet you with a smile which is more than enough for people who are stepping in

bohot hi khoobsurat jagah
esi jagah jahan aap sukoon se beth sakte hain apne dosto aur family ke sath

food  1 must try chicken white sauce pasta isse behtar pasta maine kahin nahi khaaya 

2 must try all the brews very different and unique in taste beers which are imported from various countries 

3 for a starter with your drinks do order fried idli and crispy corn

thank you ",5,

overall  45
food 355
ambience 45",4,
the place was pretty crowded for a weekday we ordered a couple of chicken items i only remember the food to be extra spicy the brews of this place are good though,3,
the food is really good in comparison to other pubs or bars they have an assortment of foreign drinks some of which are really nice the ambience is pleasing but the metal table and the chairs might cause a slight discomfort to some,5,
quite expensive to be fair good ambiance and great beer collection but go only if you have robbed a bank otherwise your wallet will have a major dent,4,
"we went during lunch time it is a good place
drinks are nice
they have offers for lunch too
the seating is nice booking a table is better when going for lunch because it is crowded usually",4,
"been here a couple times now great service nice food not terribly expensive the ambience is okayish gold works here so that is good would definitely go again i only wish they were open for longer ",5,
its a big mistake if ever u plan to have your food here we have ordered for veg pasta  we have been served with chicken pasta we have waited for an hour just for broccoli and left without having our food,1,
such a great ambience it has food is damn tasty service can be actually improved choice of drinks and food are really less would recommend it for food it has,4,
nice place with good ambience and good staff tried 2 beer both were good mocktail and cocktail were good noodles and chicken hongkong was tasty the only flaw for which i give a 4 star is lack of indian main course dishes in the menu,4,
"ordered for a red sauce pasta which came sweet then ordered for a veg assorted pizza expecting of a better experience but failed there too it was too bland and nowhere near to a decent pizza too
there was a band performing too but was so boring that we hardly listened to any of its songs",2,
"nice ambience we went on a live music night by band qurbat they were amazing

staff was courteous service was good as well

now coming to food
we ordered pasta in cheese sauce which was fairly cooked the taste was satisfying
also tropical punch and i am fan of all the fruits they prepare it with hence i liked it",5,
"today we went to this place for office party the place seems to be strategically located near biodiversity signal in order to cater crowd from nearby tech parks

the place is little small and can accommodate maximum of 5060 people during full house

they have their own brewery with many variants in beer the food quality is very good for both veg and nonveg options",4,
visited this place for dinnersoothing music and awesome ambience the pasta  nonveg platter were so good and also the mocktails were good,5,
amazing atmosphere and beautifully designed bar enjoyed the ipl match while sipping on their different styled mocktail their mocktail called salty dog is worth trying if you are a fan of salted and spicy drinks even better if you can try peach mocktail infused with tangy flavour and buzz of soda overall a great experience,5,
the ambience was good the service was way too slow and the staff was busy watching the cricket match on tv i guess the food was below average one of the server did not inform what we have ordered for pepper chicken and later the person who took the order in the starting came and he was telling that we did not order after 15 minutes of telling the other server such a poor coordination and very slow service not at all worth the price,1,
i really enjoyed the cilantro fish and pasta everything else was just ok limited variety of food nonveg main course items did not meet expectations veg main course item tasted good overall a good experience,4,
"food355 there are very limited items to order especially in main course there was only butter chicken the mocktails were also just okay

service45 they were good they knew their job well

ambience355 it was good could have been more eye catchy but it was okay the singer sang very good songs had the mood up",3,
pretty decent place with good food very limited options in liquor they have only 45 variants in scotch whiskey overall ambience was great,4,
the food is average but the service is very very poor buffet lunch was not that great food was cold when we started our lunch raita was watery starters are bearable but the restaurant really needs to pay attention to the service criteria,2,
"straight to the point the food is really good i have been there around 10 o clock in the night maybe because of that the food which was served was cold and that pretty much disappointed me 
anyways this is a nice place to hangout with friends or family it has a big screen of a match going on with light music and serves wine too",3,
"my exp with the place was a bit different from many other reviews went for a lunch with wifey the place seemed more suitable for groups college kids and so on
the food was decent though not much to complain about service was satisfactory while waiters were prompt it was not a refined experience
overall i would like to give 355but unfortunately can not on the slider scale

service 355

"only 3 stars for taste of food so visited here with colleagues for lunch
have expected a good ambeince but too crowded and service was at its lowest
might be only cause of friday
but food was good
and little conjested place",3,
if you want to see some different bar menu this is the place to be they have belgian beers which just perfection along with some unique liquors i had a pineapple martini as recommended by the waiter and that was the best martini i had till date food is also good and service is quick must visit place,5,
"tilt is one of the most popular places around gachibowli for team lunches and chill out evenings the ambiance is quirky and funky that would appeal to youngsters theres live music sports screening the window gives a n amazing view of the hitec city traffic

we started with a mango mocktail called mango festival which was the best mango drink i have tasted

cajun spiceed chicken was heavy on cajun spice and did not taste anything else

cheese broccoli was an amazing dish both cheese a d broccoli were fresh and were perfectly cooked

the cilantro fish was another great starter where in meaty basa chunks were marinated with coriander leaves a d cooked to perfection no fish smellthat is it it is a hit

they have some interesting items on the menu that one wouldnt expect at a place like this

ghee fried idli was a surprise and was amazing highly aromatic d spicy idli pieces that just fill your mouth with flavours

peanut salad similar to roadside peanut chat that we get in a fine dine form the quantity is great and you just cant stop eating it

in the main course i ordered lamb chops the chops were big and meaty but they could have been cooked better

the grilled fish with rice was again an amazing dish with fresh grilled fish a d flavourful rice

in the desserts cheesecake did not impress me they should start baking it

however the choco lava was a stunner probably the best choco lava in the city

overall a place with great food but ambiance could have been better",4,
"the food and ambience are average  in starters egg fish and chicken are sort of better  corn and all other veg ingredients are not up to what you expect it to be and moreover the main coarse is the worst to have  the desserts are decent and the fruits are the best 
i would not recommend a buffet here because the money you spent here goes down the drain think before you go the moctails they serves was the worst ",2,
" follow us on instagram at foodieshotshyd 

tilt european bar is a unique bar in hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers while the newly opened microbreweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently tilt fills in the vacuum it was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the trappist monks also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly 

we tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing belgian kreik chamborlette la trappe witte dubbel erdinger weisbier erdinger dunkel and schuimzuiper of these we liked the dubbel la trappe witte and the erdinger dunkel they also serve a variety of mocktails our favorite ones were mint mango and after glow

their food menu compliments the beers very well in appetizers we liked the cajun spice grilled chicken zesty chicken wings cilantro grilled fish cheese broccoli and guess what spicy fried idly  we were not expecting spicy fried idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it we understood why this was their most popular appetizer we loved the chicken wings they were at their juiciest best

in the main course we were served grilled fish with veggies and lamb chops with rice  french fries both the mains were great in desserts we had the blueberry cheese cake and choco lava cake while the cheese cake failed to impress us the choco lava cake was finger licking good 

we ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of smeets waffle jenever it has a brilliant sweet after taste of belgian waffles a must try 

overall tilt european bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food",5,
this place is recommended by my friendsso we visited last nightreally very good place with a beautiful ambience and a large options of food and beverage varietyi specially like the way of presentation of there food and drinksa must try place with my recommendation,5,
"great place overlooking bio diversity park junctionvery beauty full ambience with a prompt service great variety of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks with wonderful taste
specially recommend
achari paneer
fried idili nachos
overall a must try place with great offers",5,
"a chick place

went for a team lunch service was very good with staff being courteous and prompt in serving food

we opted for buffet which has decent number of options for both vegetarian and nonvegeterians

an ideal place to hangout with friends on a game night enjoying the drinks and food",3,
i really do not like the place much  the prices were too high  small area  just do not like that much the music was not upto the mark  and the place was dull,3,
"hands down the best beer in town love their cherry beer
ghee podi idly butter garlic mushrooms noodles are my favorite appetizers here ",5,
the place is good but not for non drinkers they are not willing to pay any attention towards non drinkers almost all staff members are concentrated at drinkers table only in short not a good place for non drinkers,1,
food taste is good customer service also good ambience and music also nice cool place to hangout with friends overall it is very goodwe enjoyed,5,
"food was good but they need to look into quantity which they serve quantity was quiet less
mango mint cream is the must try drink of this restaurant",4,
"been here with my buddies meeting after few months

place and ambience is too good
i would love to hangout there again probably with the same bunch of buddies again

service is good too this place mentions the  of alcohol content for every drink anyone who wants to try to have alcohol for the first time this place is of course a good start of it

i would recommend non vegetarians to go to this place because i do not find veg tasty here but thankfully i am a pure non vegetarian",4,
"i went there last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience the place is on the second floor and you can view the traffic near the biodiversity park junction it is not very crowded either and thus you are able to get a good amount of attention from the staff they are courteous and efficient and if not sure they do check and come back with the right response

they have a good variety of tap beers we initially tasted the chambourlette la trappe witte schuimzuiper and erdinger weisbier chambourlette is very mild slightly fruity too la trappe witte was smooth hada flavour of some good fresh spices and no bitter after taste schuimzuiper was a little bitter and erdinger weisbier was very mild the obvious choice for us was la trappe witte

for food we ordered nachos chicken wings and schezwan paneer nachos was okay basically it lacked topping it looked as if the cheese was applied using a brush and the toppings were more like a garnish schezwan paneer was amazing the paneer too had actually soaked the taste of the spices and was wonderful for main course we ordered veg hakka noodles which was again prepared well and the noodles too were quite light

the ambiance of this place is okay the music is at the right volume and does not make you yell to talk the place however is very dimly lit that your eyes strain while reading the menu as well but overall a fairly good place to hangout with friends and quench your thirst",4,
late review been there once for dinner and deinks nice small place good vibe cocktails were made well  no issue with gold did go to frio later for desserts,4,
the best place to chill out with friends  a best place to enjoy the food and alcohol  the staff also good at serving  best place to hangout,4,
best imported beers in hyderabad such an amazing place for a drinks and food a must visit for people who droll for belgium and german beers,5,
"the food and drinks are really good  so is the service
but the place lacks the aura to drive you repeatedly
it is too mundane to be a weekend place",4,
" must visit for tap beer

went here on a saturday evening for a couple of drinks and this place did not disappoint

the place is a dimly lit bar scene overlooking the biodiversity park signal not crowded when we went there we got ourselves into a table with good view of the city

we tried weissbeer and mango tango mocktail the beer was a wheat beer which has similar taste of a draught beer you usually get but it was different in a good waymocktail was pulpy and sweet overall drinks were 

to go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette the chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel the cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high overall food was good

the service was quick and promptmaybe due to less crowd when we went and no issues there

overall i would definitely recommend this place for a casual drinks night with friends or family",4,
"visited this place for a weekday lunch buffet
ambiance is really good and even the variety of food offered is good for the price range 
both veg and non veg starters were nice and in main course would specially mention the mutton biryani apart from this there is live counter for pasta which is pretty good as well
dessert section is decent but the molten lava cake with ice cream was amazing it was served piping hot and really ended the meal on a delicious note",4,
it is another good spot which i frequent with friends great selection of craft beers love the taste the staff are always extremely friendly and give good suggestions often go here to wind down the day with a pitcher of beer,5,
"landed in this small bar for new year lunch buffet they had limited items in their spread but each of them were super yummy nothing to complain about as this costed us merely 400bucks per head
for drinks i would totally recommend project 51 cocktail a must try
the only downside was service the waiters were friendly but extremely idle and we had a waiting period of atleast 10mins between the serves many of the items were only served after repeated calls",3,
"this is not a place to express hate but today i went their for a lunch it was a downer
we got the empty buffet counters and plates pasta counter is closed too early and all i felt shame in front of my guest poor guest management and service even you can see in photo my plate was empty even after the beer came on the table i never prefer for a party over their but sugeest you its a nice place to have beer and have some snacks as a bar siting on the bar counter the beer over their was awesome give only mark for the beer",1,
great place all the food i have tried is great they serve great shrimp and pizza ambiance is also really nice fun place to go with friends,5,
i have been to this place four times before and each time the service is excellentthe food is delicious and drinks are the best the beers here are authentic,4,
been here around five times and have had a great experience each time the owner and the staff are very friendly food is great quality i loved the nachos and pasta the most the desserts are also very delicious the choco lava cake is life changing only have good things to say about the restaurant the wide range of mocktails was also great would 100 go again and recommend to anyone searching for a fun place to eat and hangout,5,
"love everything about this place food drinks ambience and service
we had water chestnuts cheese broccoli and nachos in starters pizza was good too a good place to hangout with friends",4,
we found insect in the beer we informed to the management but the way of their behaviour is worst this is not good and bad experience in this bar,1,
worst quality we found spider at glass of beer and we informed to them but there was no response from their side it is very bad experience with this bar,1,
"we found dead spider in beer mug which was disgusting the folks from hotel claimed that it fell from roof or from ac duct  which is not possible as we four of us could have not missed a spider landing into a beer 
even going by what hotel folks told that spider landed from roof or air conditioning duct its a matter of hygiene which is missing   on a lighter note the person who was drinking from the glass has not got any spider man capabilities ",1,
catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance as this place is mainly a bar it is not sensible to comment on the food the spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good pricing is also decent,3,
"great place overlooking bio diversity park junction to unwind after a hectic work day

parking is valet is headache

ambiance is quite contemporary  cozy
music is loud  heavy

great verities of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks with wonderful taste

veg starters
fried idli nachos  outstanding
grilled veggies garlic bread  very good
achari paneer  good can be little more softer  burnt at corners

main course
mixed veg curry  butter nan are simply awesome

dessert
chacolava with ice cream  okeish

pricing  little bit higher for the quantity however quality is top notch

service  when crowd is less very fast  vice versa

must try place check for great offers before ordering",4,
"they claim to be a european bar who serves continental cuisine
went here with my pals
we ordered peri
 peri chicken pizza and assorted pizza

service the waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well
the service was not the quickest with around 68 people in the house
good parking available here

food the pizzas were pretty mediocre i liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount we asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff
peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging
the pizzas were missing the wow factor and was not really specially
my friends ordered pastas and wings
wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and was not too good

ambience it has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music  really liked the ambience and the decor as well the tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look

worth a shot with zomato gold

we ordered some fish fry it was good  zesty chicken wings were good  crispy corn was tasty  and i do not remember the name of chicken item but it was the best,4,
"nice view of busy junction of gachibowli this place is for the people who are looking for an wonderful brewery also a nice place to hangout ",4,
"visited this place for an office party that was organised pretty good place considering very compact space and seating the smoking area is way too small

the food is not that great but quite delicious  nothing i can comeplain off egg munchuria was standout off all the dishes we ordered

overall a onetime visit place  lacks repeat value just because it is way too small",3,
"nice place for non drinker
had order broccoli starter taste was good
order couple of veg curries taste was good

surprisingly they did server any dal",4,
"foodieeglobetrotter
perfect place for belgian beer
i visited this place for sunday drunchas they say it breakfastlunchdrinks
it costs for rs1000 per person inclusive of taxes which includes welcome drink soup starters main course dessert and 2 tap beer of your choice
i loved their hospitality for welcome drink they asked our choice and prepared it fresh

in soup they had hot and sour which was yummy

in starters they provided 67 differnt varieties which included crispy corn paneer tikka garlic bread etc

coming to the main course they had limited menu with dal fry dal makhani mix veg paneer korma naan chapati curd fryums and 3 kinds of salad

they also cooked white sause paste just for us

in desserts they had walnut cake cutfruits gulab jamun shahi tukda icecream and chocolava cake

drinks we asked for was belgian kriek erdinger dunkel and schzuimzuiper

desserts were kind of okay so my suggestion is to make them better because it is the last part of the meal so everyone wants it perfect",4,
"tilt bar or european bar 

i was surprised to hear of belgian beers being served in here they are served nowhere else across india

from bitter to spicy sweet the options in imported beers are available in heaps la trappe trappist is one of the most recommended beers in here endured through 600 years old history of monks brewing it

for those who like it sweet you should try belgian kriek taste is perfectly balanced with rich sweetness giving it a fresh finish without the bitter aftertaste

no beer belly

beer hunters this is the right place to rejoice if you are after some exotic beer

must try bottle beers
1 la trappe isodor
2 la trappe triple
3 green killer
4 silly saison
5 barbar blond

i will let you in a little secret  ask for the dessert of drinks smeets waffle jenever shot and do not you miss

mocktail

after glow  an amalgamation of fresh fruits mixed with mint and topped with litchi grape juices

starters i would recommend

chicken wings stuffed mushrooms and cheese broccoli

mains

honey glazed lamb chops served with fries and rice the rice flavour should be enhanced with an increase in quantity 

desserts

blueberry cheesecake it stands out from the rest i have had at other places

the staff is amicable and polite swift service provided

live music available as well music system needs to be improved as the audio quality of vocalist sounds completely distorted

instagramcom",5,
"hats off to tilt republic bar the only europeon bar in hyderabad for having such huge array of beers from different parts of the world

the food ambiance service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers

when i say food is good in elaboration i mean from starters to main course to desserts everything is oh  so delicious

the liquor section of tilt is hands down the most rare one i say this cause of the beers they offer i am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing i have had before

the beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldnt get the taste elsewhere

no no the story does not end here one thing you wouldnt want to miss is
the special shots over here 
jenever waffle smeets  my fav over here
jenever citroen
jenever bessen

can not stress enough of how delicious these shots areand very boozy

a place that deserves multiple visits",5,
"oh hyderabad brings amazing super exciting lunch

they have some unique willing concept are the beers brewed by monks no beer bellyall imported beers

"man i unabashedly love tilt it is a unique spot amongst all the bars in hyderabad what sets it apart is both the beer and the service order the egg manchuria without fail the cooks are so good at making it now that you will not find a better version anywhere else in town

the food tends to be on the spicier side so if you do not want that do remember to tell you waiter during your order if you prefer it otherwise this even applies to the pastas and pizzas",5,
"lovely european bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer no exaggeration

most of the drinks they have are imported from europe and are supposedly not found any where else across india

they also serve trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
and they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and will not give you a beer belly

everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and i can vouch for that they are pricey but worth it

excellent choice in beers probably amongst the best in hyderabad
sober ambiance and good music
wonderful mix of crowd and some okay dishes served up

we tried the egg manchuria was pretty unique and then it was the spicy fried idli was off beat
the chicken tikka was standard

a little spicy on your pocket but what the heck a few beers do not harm

although the service could have been a little more prompt

see the tilt in the beer

i have only one word mediocre we went there thinking it would have good music and nice decor but it had neither since we were not drinking the menu also seemed very limited go there if you wanna drink n snack but then there are cheaper places which offer both with a better ambience,3,
it was almost after an decade i landed in hyd and zomato came in rescue for my saturday night i always feel the substance of the place is paramount and tilt bar will not dissapoint you craftb served here is smooth as the breeze and i got so drenched till the closing erdinger beer matched my dna and with amazing pizza and garlic bread spread with cheese ball must for vegetarian is lamb served was good and so was chicken i so lived that night at tilt is,5,
i have been here a couple of times love their beer collection specially la trappe witte the bruschettas are amazing food overall was good if you want to get away from all those noisy places and just spend quality time with friends this is the place to go great beer good food and nice music is a deadly combination a must try place,4,
absolutely awesome beers almost forgot how a belgian beer tastes like and this place is a paradise for me and my mates never thought i would find such a place in hyderabad my pudding had hobgoblin which got his rare good side up and i had witte  the god of all beers this will be our pub for next few years and will inform our fellow mates to check this place out asap,5,
food and ambiance was good the drawback was the service we ordered saucy chestnut and they took almost an hour to serve it each time we asked the manager he said it will be served in 5 minutes there was also a spider on our table thankfully after we finished our food informed the manager again he could not care less,3,
great variety of tap and bottle beers that cater to almost every kind of palate  food was above average specially recommend their cilantro fish,4,
had a wonderful time here with frnds if you like to like beers then this is the right place for you they nice varieties of beers we tried the la trappe witte and eddenger wibber which is very light and smooth i liked it and in the food we just tried nachos which was decent overall we enjoyed it,4.5,
"a friend of mine recommended this place the best part of this place is the variety of beers that are available very few places in hyderabad where beer taste is nice and it will be one of them

food is above average and ambience is nice sports lovers can hangout here enjoying their drinks",5,

"went with our colleagues last week and had a good lunch over there coming to ambience it is quite dark with sufficient light  am quite impressed with the furniture with minimalistic design
food which did not impressed me much  options are less pasta is terrific  miloxktails are the best among all they had their own flavours which is not copied somewhere ",3,
"if you have not tasted saucego to tilt went yesterday beer is ok
cilantra fishtastes only of sauce
chilli lambtastes only of sauce
chilli eggtastes only of sauce
mutton kebabdoes not taste like anything

sad to saythe most overpriced and shittiest food i have ever tasted in hyderabad
one star for the beer and masala peanuts

on top of that they tried to scam us by charging a whopping service charge",1,
"nice ambience  good food got discount for zomato gold service was on prompt  overall nice place to hang out
pasta was delicious 
must visit place",4,
"good ambience
the food was great we tried veg platter and schezwan noodles
i liked the beer best lots of brews available each flavour was different i loved barbar and green killer ipa

waiters were courteous and prompt

the only thing i was not satisfied about was the cleanliness in general tables were a bit greasy",4,
"i went to this place for a date and absolutely loved it the layout  lighting music is perfect for a romantic dinner even if you are with friends and do not want to miss out an important match this is a very nice place for good food good company and the indian team on a large screen p the staff is very very good one of the best for the two of us they found a cosy corner where we would get some quietness yet not miss the matchwhen we were undecided about what to order one of them politely suggested a fish dish and that turned out to be oh so tasty cilantro fish is a must try here i could have easily had another platethe softnessthe perfect marinationthe taste of corianderi loved itthen i ordered the non veg platter and i had wished i had just taken another suggestion  i did not like prawn tempura at allpepper chickensoya chilli lamb and sesame fried fish were okayish
for drinks again we turned to the waiter and he was again bang on with his choiceshe got me a belgian kriek which is white beer based drink with the blend of cherry juicei loved the tanginess followed by rich sweetness that lingers on in the mouth my friend tried erginder dunkel  this is a wheat beer with delicate roasting aromasi took a sip and liked it but i liked mine betterp then came the best part of our dinner  the choco lava cake the ice cream served in a seperate bowl and the brownie filled with chocolate syrup which oozes out when you cut itcomplete foodgasm one of the best choco lavas i have hadi m gonna visit this place quite frequently d",4,
this is my second visit to tilt bar  loved the ambience of the place  this time i really enjoyed with food specially live counter pasta prepare by prahallad panda such a amazing taste  the service also very quick and the staffs are very friendly  even they have amazing drinks and the place is really cozy and not a very loud,5,
good food good ambience good service went for lunch and dinner casual place to hangoutstarters are really nice and they really bring the food fast,5,
nice italian and english food we tried alfredo pasta veg and fish and chips  both of em tasted yummy the place was busy on tue evenings too we have not tired no drinks so got no clue,4,
"i would rate ambience hardly at three and does not look like the pics on zomato the place was smelly and even the ac was not working well 
beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down they do not have an inhouse brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too in comparison to it there are a lot of places to try inhouse brewed beers like otm brewery etc
even their food menu is so limited and we tried their chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza i had in a long time just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 bucks similar experience with fish and chips the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish
really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as i went with high hopes i do not recommend this to anyone because it is not even cheap to recommend to those who do not want to spend much",3,
"thankyou zomato that i found this place i have never had this amazing belgium beer amazing variety the best was their white wheat german beer the fruit belgian beer was also good we ordered barbeque chicken which was good
the service is amazing and service people do their best to make your visit amazing",5,
"went there two times and ordered one same dish ie grilled fish with rice and i must say it is flawlessit should be there signature dish
other dishes were tasty too liked their servicewell trained staff overall a good place to enjoy",5,
it is located in the heart of gachibowli but the service was not as expected delay service and then the food was not that good the ambience was good though they need to improve their service as well as the food  i hope the management will look into the above points so that the next time we plan to visit we get a good food and service,3,

only one rice itemtasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
salads were good
chat items not worthy

the best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance

ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail

coming to starters non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok but they can introduce something new as its same everywhere

we have chicken wings chicken kabab fish prawns they were just amazing

we have tawa chicken and prawns but that was not up to the mark and that tawa items needs a huge change in taste

main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like laal maasmutton prawns were awesomelove to visit again to eat this amazing prawns

coming to desserts they were just melting in mouth my all time favourite jilebi with rabdi asked for some hot jilebi at the end as well i got a few
kheer was ok gulab jamun was good

this was totally an accidental visiti had no idea about this place before we stepped into this one except for the fact that it is a bbq placeas the name suggestsit is two floored building beautifully liti was here for dinnerwe opted for first floorthey immediately got the grill and the buffet startsit is like any other bbq place but with high quality foodthe starters are so very freshi definitely give it one of the best bbq places in the citythe menu was pretty much the samethe chicken wings deserves a special mentionwe repeated it like 3 times awemazingthe main course was decentthe dessert section was again okay specially pan shotwas like a panflavoured liquid in shot glasses and i loved iteverything was pretty much decent but what made me love this place more was the servicethe service is amazingshout out to ashraf and reethamthey made our experience more pleasant the only complain about this place is the playlistmore of old and sad bollywood songs it was so loud and it totally is a huge offi suggest please change the playlist guysit is ruining the whole vibe of the placethis is the first time i had to bear music instead of enjoying itanywaysi liked the unexpected visit to this place,4,
"we were 31 people went together for a lunch buffet on 22nd april tables were arranged on 1st floor for us and no one else were allowed which is a plus for big group coming to menu its kind of same what all bbq places are offering now a days taste was good for most of the items staffs were polite and quick on services only thing which didnt went well was ac of the resturant as it was a hot afternoon ac was not enough to cool us down manger apologized for this they also gave us a 10 off on total bill because of 20 people

advices to management  please have some unique food item which is not there on other places
looking forward to visit again",4,
great food awesome ambience excellent service by raza and subhendu wide range of options in starters and desserts reasonable pricing must visit,5,
food was really good thankyou raza subendhu and ashraful and uk were really helpful and polite in serving the food ambience was good and i would definitely visit again,5,
"the food is awesome very tasty 
staff suvendu and raza also took very good care of us the starter specially the azwaini prawns was too yummy had a great experience with my team will surely visit again",5,
"food ok and service is really goodraza and subenthu are friendly staff
veg and non veg both are good including desert food
thank you",5,
this restaurant has got a good location and interior in the buffet menu the starters and grilled items are good but the main course need serious improvements main course dishes are average and not up to mark i think the price is also quite high in comparison to its dishes,4,
"enjoyed the food and cool ambience the playlist was relaxing with amaazing prawns
one of the best place to have brunch on weekends
good food at great price",5,
food was good  service was fast staff courteous subendu and raja took good care of us overall great experience do not forget to try jalebi rabri ask the guy to make jalebi a bit crisp,5,
after hearing good reviews about this we went for lunch buffet first and foremost thing you will notice is the courteousness of the staff there once you book the table they write your name on a board outside we took the seat in the first level as the ground floor was full starters were served veg starters were too spicybut very tasty its better you mention them the spice level before itself even main course was pretty good in terms of taste nothing much special in the menu but taste and staff were good bala who served us was very courteous please give him a star,4,
"after months of trying out buffet restaurants in and around gachibowli we were pleasantly surprised to find out that everything about the indi grill was worth the visit one of the rare places where you will find consistent quality across dishes  starters main course and dessert jalebi does require a special mention

combine this with courteous staff who ensure you have a good time right from the moment you step in and you have the perfect experience

i would recommend visiting the place in the first slot as things are reasonably quiet not surprised at all that the second slot starts getting crowded

if i had to be really critical the veg menu has that tiny scope of improvement in an otherwise perfect place keep it going",5,
i had a team dinner on friday nightthe food was really awesome mouthwateringwe enjoyed lot with loud music here we got the amazing service by team indigril for sure we visit again to this place folk must try the indigril,5,
great ambience to start with taste and quality good the only concern is that the variety is less service is decent surender our steward for the lunch was very patient and helpful,3,
"chicken wingschocolate killer puddingbalu shahi are delicious foodservice is greatprice is affordablewill definitely

"i read the reviews of this place on the day this was open was public though reviews were not too good and after mixed feedback from friends took a chance to visit this place with the team for a team lunch

the food quality was excellent  retains the name of the moti mahal
ambience  5 star for the prices you pay for
service 5 star",5,
raza is service is amazing would surely suggest this place receiving was pretty good and the mushroom pops are a must try along with the welcome drink,5,
overall food was good anytime better than bbq nation salad options could have been improved menu was loaded with regional foods like gatte ki sabji of rajasthan bengali fish curt etc however gatte ki sabji not at all upto the mark,4,
good place to have food here for a typical south indians who would like to enjoy barbeque food ambience and service are mesmerising which made us show interest towards having food,4,
one of the latest buffet places in town visited there last weekend for lunch quite a big place with good decor staff were helpful and service was quick i loved the starters there chicken leg kebab other chicken starter were also very good the best was prawns tandoori prawns were just amazing crispy corn salsa potato and pineapple were also available main course also had good variety from chicken mutton to fish desserts were also good loved the galebi and rabdi the most,4,

when it comes to spread of items they were just too many barbeque items main course as well as desserts the taste was however was not to the level of satisfaction ambience was just average

service definitely needs a heavy improvement we went on a non rush day serving of barbeque items were over flowing in the first and single service there is no concept of coming to the table second time no one really really bothered the table even after requesting so many times servers really did not bother much to serve breads in the table or refilling any barbeque items we just had to go with the main course to continue our lunch mutton curry and biryani were extra ordinary jalebi served in desserts was too good",3,
this restro is located in gachibowli in the platina building we headed to this place for dinner with team on friday eveningthe place is good ambience wise and the stuff are friendly toothe service was quick and they do ask you the reviews and suggestionsnow coming to the food it was okay but as compared to other buffet kitchens like abs or barbeque nation they still lag behind with the same pricethe starters were good in taste but the main course and dessert was ok ok,3,
the food and the ambience is good special thanks to the service they are good it is recommended for the people who like to have food peace and spicy,5,
"sakeel thank you so much for your excellent service and respect crazy time with my team dinner went great 
food is a bit spicy for me but all my teammates love spice liked it very much",4,
food was excellent special thanks to shahid saket and narendra for giving proper attention to us even when there was crowd keep it up guys will recommend others to visit the place,5,
great food and great service thankyou raza shakeel mudassar and ashraful keep it up lot of food options and delicacies will come again,5,
very polite and professional stafffood was served hot fresh and on time thank you asaram shakeel and raja for wonderful service you guys rock we are definitely coming back,5,
"this is located prominently along the main road and is a part of the same group which has the moti mahal chain of restaurants

hopped in for lunch on a weekday after a movie at the nearby mall and it was a good experience to put it across in a lucid manner the starters have mostly the usual fare you would see in a typical barbeque restaurant there was chicken fish prawn mutton seekh kebab chicken tangdi chicken meat balls etc in the non veg fare the veg had the typical paneer pineapple corn on the cob crispy potatoes in sauce which i would say were delectable along with the crispy corns there is a complimentary mocktail which was decent but the masala coke i ordered later had too much masala and too little fizz for my liking

the chats were toothsome and lip smackingly tasty i also liked the kulchhas and parathas in the main course they were soft and had the right texture and taste just the way they should be special mention of the veg and non veg manchow soup which was appetizing my wife had multiple rounds of the same the chicken fish and mutton curries were good but i liked the dal makhni and matar methi malai among the lot the gulab jamun and halwa along with the jalebi and rabdi were supremely delicious in the desserts section

the service was quick and prompt special mention of raghuveer singh who took care of our requirements and was always available when required this is not a big place hence the ambiance is not much to talk about they have seating on the first floor too which is an added bonus all in all this is definitely a place worth trying",4,
"located in the busy streets of kondapur this one gains quite an attention
indigrill is a chain of the grand moti mahal restaurants
set up in ground and first floors has a decent ambience
for present they are only running buffet section but they are going to start alacarte soon


we have been invited to try their buffet section
welcomed by the friendly staff we have been served first with their welcome drink
then moving on to the grill they had chicken fish and prawns on bbq in non veg
fish and prawns tasted great while chicken was a little hard
in vegetarian paneer mushroom and pineapple were served
apart from grill they had other starters too
mutton sheek kabab served here is one of the best i ever had
fresh minced mutton made into soft kebabs tasted amazing
and crabs were little but slow cooked and prepared in such a way that the flesh comes off easily tasted amazing


we were almost filled with starters but their main course spread is huge too
my favorites were
crab curry and mutter paneer


and in desserts
gulad jamun and jilebi with rabdi were lip smacking
strawberry pudding and phirni tasted good too",4,
"this place is nice for formal dinners and family dinners it is a comfortable place and the service was quick
barbeque and starters was good here but the food here was average",4,
"this place is highly recommended it is working with eat india company under the same roof may be kitchen as well basically u ca order any of the two is menu from one table eat india company has indian food while urban asia has asian food like chinese thai food etc

we ordered the real bangkok basa chefsubba is secret recipe noodles and sanghai fried rice from urban asia

the real bangkok basa it tastes so good it was steamed fish and mixed with some green sauce taste was 55 

subba is secret recipe noodles was gravy noodles with lots of veggies mushroom chicken taste 55

sanghai fried rice was a mixed of noodles and rice in which noodles was more than the rice taste was 55

service 45 little bit slow in bringing food

we had evening dinner at this restaurant food was delicious we had chinese as well as north indian both were delicious i recommend for weekend food with family here,5,
"the staff is kind and i think that is the moto of the restaurant the food is delicious and there is the option for buffet and alacarte so we choose buffet which every thing they served on the table which is really a good thing for me because i went with my parent coming to the food special i like the most corn cube prawn fish and yes ofcourse murgh angarathe staff cares about all its customers and are polite just amazing

"came here on a thursday evening for dinner only to be served the worst quality food the service was absolutely terrible no air conditioning in the sweltering heat  after multiple requests we got our food  literally begged for the food to be served what is not there on the buffet menu also they do not tell the customer the main course was served cold prescooped ice creams and what not

some mango juice they served do not know how that was drinkable 

worst decision to spend our evening here  absolutely terrible experience

giving one star because i can not give 5

food  1005

ambience  no air conditioning on a summer evening
price  not worth even 15th",1,
i ordered a thai curry which is to die for  the waiters were so polite the best thing in this place is that it is calm and quiet it is a good place to relax and enjoy great food,5,
"the place is not worth going too overrated and over priced from starters to desserts the food is not worth the money and not tasty they do not charge properly for zomato gold you have to check the bill carefully for the items deducted under gold 22 i would rate the place as

simply the best asian restaurant in the city so fresh and lively food this will enhance your health as well i am vegetarian and i like the way they decorate and combine the veggies must try corn cubes vegetable pan fried noodles 4 star for the service which needs improvement,4,
"this is my second visit to this place like the ambience much and cool place to chill out had been there along with a friend for dinner we did not want to go for buffet for sure so it was ala carte

angara murgu kabab rara ghost and butter naan starter was with much salt and lemon rara ghost is nice perfection at it is best was a good combination with butter naan

service was very nice and as i said earlier nice ambience",3,
visited urban asia based on their rating and reviews however we were utterly disappointed we visited the gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with east india co the waiter handed us the signature menu and that is when the ordeal began most of the signature dishes were unavailable it was surprising since it was a saturday and i assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their signature menu eventually we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650 overall a disappointing evening,3,
we have been there for team dinner for a buffet ambience is good food is decent but serving is not at all good you can neglect this as we have lot of options aroubd gachibowli,3,
this is one of the favourite food spots in jubilee hills but this outlet they have started in gachibowli too been here with cousinchecked out menu for having different thing and ordered starter corn and cheese crudettes in smoked butter garlicit was really yummy and the best starters i had in recent times and had aamir is and gautam is anda bandi fried the name itself was catchytaste was also perfectwas spicy and yummy,4,
amongst the so many options now available for dining at gachibowli urban asia is difficult to ignore both for location and food getting in there if you are driving can be tricky sometimes since there is too much traffic in a narrow lane however they have a valet in the basement and you can park there and head over to the 4th floor which actually is a mix of a few restaurants the place offers both buffet and alacarte options and you could choose what you like we ordered pad thai noodle and chilly tofu i have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot moreover the portion size was fairly decent the pad thai tasted slightly sweet to my wife is liking but again flavoursome and good portion the place was quiet and you could enjoy your food in peace the staff is courteous and service is prompt,4,
used to be a frequent visitor at this place was total disappointed yesterday night  food was aweful to taste chicken starter in bean sauce was bitter in taste they we are serving what they deemed fit for us and not as per our order chicken lababdar was wanting in taste fennel seeds were used and curry was as thin as a soup  no one was nearby when serving were required service is what we look forward to when dining in your restauranteither there was change in chef or some other temporary issues hope it would be fixed soon and we will not be disappointed when dining next time with our friends,5,
the place has the best asian food options the nasi goreng here is authentic and taste like it not like other restaurants where they just give u fried rice the pork fried rice is very tasty as well,4,
i went to urban asia on a date and we had planned to have sushi sushi was not available at all we were heartbroken sorry sir became the theme that night date went dull,2,
the staffs are very friendly and polite this is one of the best chinese restaurant in hyderabad i suggest this place to all the people who love authentic oriental cuisine,5,
ambience is just decent but the food is justtttt mouth wateringhave tried nyonya it was heavena must try dish the signature dishes are the best,5,
visited on a weekday for a quick dinner ordered the kung pao chicken  mojito and schezwan noodles food was very delicious especially the king pao chicken will definitely go back to explore more,4,
the food was not made well and the service needs a lot of improvement the pad thai was too sticky and the thai green curry was very watery they didnot have ice to make drinks and we were kept waiting for a very long time for the bill the outlet needs better management unhappy with my visit here,1,
we have been to urban asia  kitchen  bar gachibowli we ordered crisp noodles shrimps with sweet and sour sauce which was obviously a wrong choice crispy noodles is never a right choice at least for me wherever you go and sweet n sour soup with shrimps just made it worse i am a seafood lover and the quantity and size of shrimps did not justify its price next was standing pomfret dish in schezwan saucewhich turned out to be a disappointment who prepares pomfret in allpurpose flour it was not good at all,1,
"love this place for food i recommend tamang chilli chicken  heaven on a place  hakka noodles not so impressive i always go for  la carte  buffet menu not so tempting staffs are courteous and service is good ",5,
food is very nice especially chilli lamb and honey chilli potato is amazing good thing with this restaurant is it consists of three different menus the thing i am saying is we can eat three different restaurants menu food in single place drinks collection is also good,5,
"food  4
service  3

the food is nice but the fancy dishes fail to impress had ordered lotus leaf fried rice  but that neither had any distinguishing flavor of lotus leaf nor a hint of chili oil but what lets you down is the service  too slow

and they also goofed up on the zomato 11 food offer they later corrected it but not before arguing

will i go here again  yes but not the gachibowli joint the other urban asia at jubilee hills is a way better",3,
"sushi was bad
starters were okay 
i do not understand why there waso muglai  indian food and not asian food in an restraunt which specialises in asian cuisine",3,
"dissatisfaction and disappointment

urban asia gachibowli 
i am here for a lunch buffet but alas wasnt what i was expecting starters pathetic 
the prawn is okaish apart from that everything stands to be a disaster uncooked chicken malai kababs to kabab mei  huddi bone
beware of the dirty stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin

soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water the mocktail tasted really good finally 

coming to the main course i am not putting up any pictures as they were average  trust me nothing special 

the chat counter was good u can try that from chole kulche to bhel puri 4 items

deserts limited but were good

ice cream they were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand

overall

"on a saturday casual lunch i was simply floored by the ambiance they have set up and i could not stop looking at the artifacts they have put up its like one could just spent hours looking at them and admiring the heritage of india

i was in mood for chinese and went full blast
the wonton soup superceded the manchow one
the dragon prawns were okayish the sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier

coming on to the main course we had ordered a barrage of items
sanghai fried rice loved it
kung pao chicken  delicious
hunan chicken  bland had to parcel
shrimp soft noodles good
bamboo fried rice good
pan fried noodles in cantonese sauce a disaster

for my part i had ordered food which turned out to be best my friends were dissapointed

the mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch

i loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken it has stuck on my taste buds

asian food k deewano must go n try 

before ordering make sure you check with staff ingredients used in japanese  chinese food",4,
good food recommend the garlic fried rice and fried ice cream the veg dimsums are also very good the only problem is the service it is a bit slow,3,
this is my most favourite chinese asian cuisine joint here i have been to this place a couple of times and their food is absolutely to die for the buttet garlic rice and the green curry is lipsmackingly good in appetisers i love the pork dumplings which are white balls of juiciness and the pork ribs that completely melt in your mouth the staff is helpful and courteous absolutely love everything about this place,5,
i have only been to this place once and i cannot forget the noodles i had i never found that texture or taste in noodles anywhere else i love it the quantity is too much for a single person and good for 2 so do try it out,4,
great experience awesomely decorated inside very calm and quiet atmosphere appropriate place for both couple and family dining food quality is also delicious great service,5,
ambience is not as good as the one in jubilee hills but kudos to them for maintaining the same taste courteous staff gets a bit crowded towards the weekend so better to book a table prior they have tie up with zomato for booking table which is good tried the famous narsi goreng and it lived up to the expectation,4,
firstly my cocktail was messed up and than paneer lababdar with pathetic gravy was too bad to consume overall food experience was bad i would never recommend this place to any of my friends or peer,2,
pretty nice place with great food i initially thought it would be costlier but they have quite a lot of quantity which is great overall it is quite a cool place,4,
extremely pleased to have visited this place and experiment with their masterpiece i was disappointed as they didnt serve sushi on the day we visited but rest of the food compensated for the grief the pork ribs were amazing the nasi goreng was something i was looking forward and it did not disappoint me also the heaven on plate the quantity they serve is too good one main course can be shared by two with moderate appetite the decor was amazing too but what was best about this place were the courteous and highly spontaneous staff the fried icecream too was good  they served extra chocolate sauce on request must try this gem of a place,4,
"this place is nothing as it is shown in the images the ambience maybe good but the service is too bad the chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as i thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp and if this was not enough the add on was the main course the name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food which creates a lot of confusion we ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies rather than semi gravy the worst is the suggestions from the manager who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them moreover despite of showing the zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food they added an extra service charge to the final bill will not complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing
my suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking and importantly do not try and take suggestion from the management
been to many asian restaurants had bad food but never got so confused about the menu i had sandip acharyya with me both of us are very dissapointed
a big no no to this place",1,
the lamb dish was good but the pork was undercooked better avoid pork here coz that could be dangerous the ambience is good the decor is warm with heritage wooden doors pillars n other elements from old rajasthan havelis,3,
amazing interior heartwarming services affordable price and wow food the quantity was more than adequate too we ordered pork ribs heaven on a plate fried ice cream and nasi goreng a must visit place,5,
"first visit

1 garlic fried rice  good
2 mixed veggies in schezwan sauce  good
3 mixed mushroom platter  did not please my taste buds left half the dish i am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom even if i liked other mushrooms i wouldnt have liked this dish it is nothing special tasted like simple sauted mushrooms
4 showstopper  yin yan soup half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste the other half of it had thick coriander soup i think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup fan of this coming back for this soup",3,
"visited this branch of urban asia this afternoon for lunch the eat india co indian restaurant is just beside urban asia and i read few reviews about this place urban asia gachibowli not serving food as good as the jubilee hills branch as they share the same kitchen but as i experienced today these branch is as good as the other one they have maintained the food quality quality exactly the same even the buffet has nice spread of asian menu as well as some indian dishes ordered our favourite pork ribs which is very very delicious ordered some chilli lamb and orange chicken chilli lamb was really delicious but the orange chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy i do not like sweet dishes may be it is the authentic orange chicken
all together good experience staff is also very courteous and professional",5,
if you want to taste really bad sushi this is the best place in town but given that my review has to be atleast 140 characters long  i repeat they are the best at serving the worst sushi,1,
"always feel good to visit urban asiaand now the best thing is we can enjoy both urban asia and eat india is food together

great food esp the know suey starters were good as well service by the attendants was poor delayed orders after multiple follow ups great ambience mild music mild air conditioning very clean definitely try the fried prawns as part of the starters wasabi needs to be more like the real wasabi they need to serve the sushi along with the wasabi and soy sauce provided in small bowls  the bowls we are missing and you had to ask for the wasabi as well should be part of the table sauces etc good to go there once in a while,3,
"we opted for alakarte here but the took a round of the food variety for buffet it was pretty good but the dessert section did not interest me much

the buffet had dumplings sushi which i felt were food for buffet

we we in mood to eat proper chinese we ordered a pork dimsum stir fried chicken starter
another chicken main course and fried rice

everything was good

but then comes the bill part

i really do not know how they missed the zomato 11 to cut from the bill
also they had so 91 bucks extra s tax apart from gst
which made us change the bill again

honestly speaking after serving good food missing the gold and adding extra money apart from gst decreases the moral value for the place

kindly try avoiding the addition of that

rest food is good
service if good
can come back again for another turn of chinese",3,
the rating for the food taste is always 45 here but when comes to service i can not rate more than 155 the 05 is just for getting bill quickly and may be 1 for getting few dishes immediately i visited this restaurant for the fifth time expecting to get better food and service than last time but it is always degrading we came in to lunch at around 245 the first thing which irritated was they were served me cold starters and i complained then they went and heated it up and served this was corn cubes they promised 11 started in the buffet menu and they never bothered to serve all i had to ask him to check what the menu was and can he serve all of them and still they never served i think they were supposed to serve soup at table along with starters which they always did before i went and asked them about it then they said it is available at the buffet section and we can go and get it i really felt like going to a place where they were serving free food and we had to go and ask for what we wanted it was absolutely ridiculous experience they started turning off the lights when we are still eating i agree we were late but switch off all the lights and we go out in a kind of darkness it is no more pathetic situation like they are not bothered about the customers and we can get in if we want i was always thinking urban asia is a premium place for good food and service but it proved other wise,1,
went here for a family dinner on a weeknight ambience is nice we were seated by a nice table by the glass wall service was very good as we got started with a manager standing close by and ensuring service was happening briskly two of us went with the buffet and others went ala carte the buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot veg appetizers were good chicken was very average and the fish was quite good budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while we did not have much appetite after the starters so that was good lots of little desserts  pastries looked better than they tasted but kids enjoyed the ice cream cold stone overall experience was quite good for all of us  attentive service always goes a long way and we will be back,4,
terrible experience the place was crowded and noisy the food had an odd smell to it it almost tasted like they were using expired ingredients wouldnt recommend to anyone,1,
completely disappointed if people are going for a team lunch or dinner please go for a better place service is worst until and unless we ask they are not bringing anything food is average starters are very less ambience is just ok not recomended,1,
"delicious food for best pricegood ambiance and awesome serving had good time here this restaurant is a combination of good food and appearance with mild music had fun ",5,
"if you want to try something new from the daily routine tastetry dinning out once in urban asia and you will love everything about it give your taste buds a try for the crispy kai in bangkok curry for starter and the cheese balls are mesmerizing  for main course you definitely try the bamboo fried rice and the malaysian curry combo you will love it and if your love is for noodles padh thai will take your breath away with it is coconut flavoury mouthwatering taste the soothing music is cherry on the cake a fine dinning and urban asia is way to go

s k allaudin is very good with handling the service and gave all of us an amazing experience",5,
the food is really good and so are the staff their thai green curry is awesome it is usually crowded so its best to call before you go the restaurant shares the kitchen with another restaurant so you get the benefit of choosing from two menus so dont have to worry which one to go to p,5,
awesome food and very good staff well behaviour specialy thanks to mr sk alauddin he take care us very well thanks u buddy  and ur management cheers up buddythanks u good pan asian food,5,
ambience decent  parking to the place is an issue  tom yum soup good  paneer tikka ok  lotus stem ok  service average steward sk was not upto the mark  he looked totally off mood  chilli garlic noodles was outstanding manchow fried rice was delicious,3,
food was amazing and the ambience is good it is nice to go there with family and friends it is little expensive but the food taste is too good,5,
this is my goto place for asian food cravings the spread is good the food is good and leaves you wanting more must try if you are looking for authentic asian food,4,
the service is very bad they are not offering the seats when they have whole restaurant empty the food is good but the manager and staffs are not that encouraging,2,
visited urban asia two times and had moderate experience food taste is pretty but service is very very slow staff took more than 20 min to serve the food initially and reordering was like endless waiting buffet services seems better than ala carte,3,
we decided to go to eat india company for dinner then found that it in conjunction with urban asia good for us as we got the opportunity to try both the restaurants food was good so was the service prices were moderate to high the place is located on the busy foodie street of gachibowli good that valet parking is there,4,
we ordered a fish starter along with main course food was good  tasted quite fresh and authentic quality and quantity both were satisfying the restaurant is in the same floor of eat india company and shares same service,4,
"a beautiful asian restaurant with awesome food

food  455 tried some items from their special menu and some from their normal menu the soup was awesome and the way it was presented with two clear demarcation between the two flavors made it even more special the dumplings were really good it was juicy at the center with a very thin crust the dumpling dip could have been better though the nyonya was again very delicious and the lemon grass flavor in the curry was just out of this world the nasi goreng was very smelly of dried fish and something that we did not enjoy have tried their buffet also earlier and liked the unconventional nature of the buffet which servers indian and asian together the green curry in the buffet was again very delicious

ambiance  355 this is actually two restaurant under the same roof i am not sure why was that done and other than the buffet it really does not make any sense sense

service  45 service was again very good they took the time to explain the dishes notified of the possible wait time for any dish and above all were very friendly

price  355 it is priced at per some of the fine dining restaurant and as such is fair the only thing is that in such fine dining set up you should not run a buffet and a la carte in parallel",4,
nice place to enjoy some south east asian food ambiance is decent service is good the food is decent dishes are not too highly priced,4,
very nice place and nice service  the person serving us was very helpful we enjoyed the chinese starters and also main course would like to visit again and try fixed menu of theirs  only improvement they can keep chinese in fixed menu too,5,
"extremely bad food at the gachibowli location i had ordered food for a party and was delivered stale food despite informing that i am ordering the food for kids one of the child got food poisoned aswell

i informed the management about this and they did not even get back to check on how the kid who fell sick was doing

extremely poor food quality and hospitality was thoroughly embarrassed in front of the guests and regret having chosen this restaurant for my event",1,
"it is two restaurants under the same roof really do not know why so because they present you the menu of both at either place not sure if they share the kitchen and chef too 
we ordered from urban asia is menu and the food was good the service on the other hand is a little disappointing probably because of the confusion between the restaurants 
ordered some lamb starters and thai curry red the thai curry was great and the remained for hours in my mouth",4,
"this restaurant space in gachibowi is the fusion of urban asia and eat india company which are under the same roof with different names

ambience

this is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience this restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors allaround the place most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors windows and locks

and also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami kings and their belongings

food

we went here for a dinner buffet the food is really delicious and this was the first time i was liking sea food in the starters all the starters are really good but kung pao fish and prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind

we do not have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth

service

the only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide though it is a buffet all the starters will served to the table there is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve

and you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve the service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance

value for money

the dinner buffet here costs around rs650 per person and you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy have a great dining and good day",3,
we had a great time in urban asia have been coming here for the last 1 year and as usual their service and their food is amazing our server today sk alauddin was very helpful and suggested the right combination of food to have apart from this he was also very polite and had decent knowledge about asian cuisine,5,
"food  35

this restaurant has eat india company and urban asia merged into one so u get both north indian and asian cuisine menus together bit confusing at the start especially because the waiters do not address this
ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce like the dish could have been less spicy though
next up was chicken dumpling this was yummy
chicken thai red curry was good and creamy but again was a bit spicy for thai curry think the restaurant needs to tone down the spicy quotient of asian food otherwise the food was fresh and tasty",4,
great food the spread was really nice has good selection for kids and adults soup and starter were awesome and your journey to great food starts kids loved the ice cream counter and desserts,5,
"i was here today with my family and what struck me the most was the amazing service offered the staff was friendly and extremely helpful and took good care of my 3 year old son must say he really enjoyed all the pampering he was being offered with regards to the food we went in for the buffet and were a bit late for lunch hence focused more on the starters must say the starters were amazing loved the prawns the most from the bunch the place has a spacious seating arrangement and a relatively good view will definitely visit this place again much of the reason here being the staff and their thoughtful and caring attitude towards the customers needs great job folks keep it up and thanks one again for making our lunch fun and comfortable today ",5,
skallauddin treated us very well the food was good he suggested good starters served with care we were offered with complimentary drinks which was very kind of him,5,

"was late at work stomach was growling like a wailing siren of an ambulance indicating an emergency to fill it up at this moment there was a row of places for the mind to choose from urban asia it was
honestly i dont dig indochinese but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal indian dishes quick service and very polite staff got those starters real quick and they were good nothing over the top just old school good stuff
main course lacked the punch though there was variety if you are really up for the mood you might be disappointed otherwise it is ok the desserts was a total miss nothing there actually the service and starters were enough for me to keep it going was not really in the mood for the mains one can give it a try especially those chinese food lovers",4,

went for a lunch buffet the buffet was good nothing exceptionally great the starters were good in taste like corn veg manchurian veg 65 paneer tikka but the soup was very weird for me
the chat section is definitely a thumbs up go for it
the dessert section had a good element of frozen ice cream watching which being made is a treat to eyes so overall a good enough place",4,
"i really enjoyed the ambience 
the lunch buffet is very tasty try the chaat  also mutton rogan josh is very delicious 
friendly staff went during lunch time alcarte serving time was slow",5,
"location just opposite gachibowli police station

ambience its beautifully decorated with both modern n urban indian styled art dimmed lighting good soothing music

food we went for a customised buffet as we were bunch of 25 team members and made a corporate reservation it consisted of 4non veg n 4veg strters
3 main course and 5desserts

its was a good place to hangout with big groups",4,
"authentic asian food loved the food here the devils chicken is bloody good and is equally spicy
we also had garlic rice and oriental chicken

will come back soon",4,
nice food and ambiance they have all kinds of food also the buffet for dinner will love to visit that place again very good service from the restaurant,4,
"i am an absolute fan of their dish signature fish in phuket sauce it is super delish and whenever i am here i have to have this fish also tried few other options here like tofu in hot chilli and they are good as well
the gachibowli place is sharing space with another restaurant which gets confusing some times

dishes tried signature fish in phuket sauce tofu in hot chilli",4,
we took buffet and got only 3 non veg starters  fish prawns and chicken  each 1 type food is average as usual nothing special rs 783 699  5 gst  7 service charge for this buffet is very too high not worth go for some barbeque restaurants for the same price and more options,2,
"i went there for lunch with an high expectation but i was a little disappointed with the food quality veg food was good but for non veg buffet was little disappointing
restaurant had a nice ambience
till this all the experience was moreover ok but at the end when the payment part came they provided a bill without gst numbers",2,
"absolutely horrendous service we avail zomato gold services and we had clearly mentioned that we wanted to avail this service before entering the restaurant we placed our order at 3 pm and they ask us to show the zomato gold id right after 3 pm restaurant closes at 3 pm and kitchen at 315 each restaurant seems to have a different policy and we customers should know beforehand what the policy is we had made it crystal clear that we were zomato gold holders and they said we could show the id later how is it fair that the staff asks us for the id after the restaurant has closed and when we could not unlock it we are first time users of zomato gold
we had to walk out horrible service stay away from this place if you do not want to be treated poorly by the manager and the staff thank you for ruining a special day why do such places have zomato gold partnership probably what they are good at is cheating customers",1,
i usually visit to this place for dining after office the variety of dishes served are good and are also tried to be kept in much authentic way  it is quite expensive as compared to other restaurants in same service,3,
food is unnecessarily over priced we have ordered very simple lunch and it was surprisingly disappointing crispy potato in hot garlic here means french fries with a bowl of hot garlic sauce,1,
visited here for saturday lunch to my surprise it was not overcrowed so i was relieved that i could enjoy my lunch the ambienece is soothing and refreshing  ideal for a dinner or lunch date or to take your family  we ordered prawns battered in beer  thai noodles  kung pao chicken mutton shorba and fried ice cream all of the items were delicious and the quantity for one plate is good enough for 3 ppl serving the prawns were fresh and tasty  i loved the fried ice cream  a must try if u visit this place  i would like to visit again,4,
"urban asia is a goto place for good chinese in town

this place never disappoints when it comes to food

amazing lamb starters very well cooked
love their pan fried flat noodles

great food quality and good ambience defines the place

the only disappointment i have had with this place was with the deserts the cheese cake was hard as it was served right out of the fridge

nevertheless this place is still a must go to place for chinese lovers",4,
"they now have kings beer from goa that gives them the highest star already
ok now for a detailed review

1 we had to ask twice for an order we were waiting on but will discount since it was weekend which usually is buffet n we went ala carte
2 asked for lemon slice for water and came promptly
3 beer was served at good temp
4 anda bandi fried egg rice was really good
5 coupled with urban asia spcl chicken it was awesome
6 n then we ordered spare pork ribs ohh the fat was delicious on it n meat just falling of the bones

overall verdict with zomato gold it is a steal even without it worth every buck",4,
"a place to fall in love with the decor and ambience is the eye catcher
variety of dishes with a good taste and price is worth to spend",5,
"our first experience with urban asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory the first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items the name of which i do not remember unfortunately

the establishment houses two different restaurants eat street and urban asia under the same roof and without any strict boundary you can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability the service usually is prompt and courteous  overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall

since we love asian cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent i would like to specially mention the nasi goreng we have tried it in many restaurants in india besides having it in bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation susi was also excellent very fresh and delicious

we would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies",4,
"their portion sizes are good for 23 people for most of their dishes unlike what your server would suggest probably he has seen a different sample size  but this is a nice chinese place serving both buffet and a la carte do try their ginger fried rice and chilli garlic noodles again i stand guilty for viewing and commenting on the menu from a vegetarian standpoint but do try their spring rolls too ",4,
"completely disappointed the staff was clearly reluctant to work
the food was mediocre at best we ordered sweet and sour chicken soup chilli chicken  hakka noodles and all flavored chicken only the soup was lukewarm everything else was cold nothing was made fresh
we had to complaint to the manager about the same who agreed with us but did nothing anyway so we walked out without completing the lunch
thoroughly disappointing
ambience is the only saving grace for this place

food 
ambience 
staff courtesy ",2,
"a must visit place for their exquisite asian cuisine not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes 

the ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth one does start feeling the aura of fine dine  for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example

we ordered vegetable chilli sticks salt and pepper chicken as starters 
vegetable chilli sticks 1st pic is a must for all vegetarians here if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best chinese dish i ever ordered 55

salt and pepper chicken was good  as told by my accompanying friend  i found the texture good  he rates it 45

for main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish 

chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies very balanced  a must to mention is the quantity served  it can be shared by 3 people 455

button mushroom diced babycorn in oysters sause this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy  it blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles 45

i also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that 25

final verdict  authentic asian food with great ambeicne with zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently ",4,
"i went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness this outlet is in gachibowli rd above ratnadeep store there are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor
it was little surprising as this restro share the common space with eat india company
we did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend 
one of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal the staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved 

we were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area we have other choicesreluctantly they agreed but i was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner 
they could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient

anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there

1 crabmeat soup this soup was thick with minced crab meat the broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce vineager and crushed pepper the whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds
2 corn cubes  a must try out platter the dish was innovative the american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried it was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency
3 chicken yakitori i did not like this preparation it was very dull and tasteless there were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion the chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor

main course 

1 manchow chicken fried rice  the rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it it was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own

dessert
1 bangkok custurd i was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite the custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree the thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts  it tasted like firni as accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls it was just yum for the greedy tongue

total rs 1396  inclusive of taxes 

cobclusion  the price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amountthe food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time

the staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card no coordination among the staffs either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest

the dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available i had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments 

this is not the place to enjoy your special occassions its just okayish for casual dinner lunch i will think twice to visit this place again",3,
"we went to urban asia for lunch around 1 30 on a sunday for ala carte and i certainly would not recommend it for anyone though the food was good the service was pathetic we were ignored for more than half an hour despite calling for the waiters multiple times we were not even given the speciality menus despite specifically asking for it

"urbanasia panasian delightfulexperience

well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now the food here is an absolute delight when they say pan asian  they mean pan asian  the experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that i was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch and i would love to visit this place over and again if not for anything but the orange chicken

food 45

the food here is an absolute delight no chance is left for any complaint good to mention both the time i have tried ala carte and not the buffet

starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil chiken to the sanghai prawns all of them were absolutely delicious the spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs it has a chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer
the aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes fresh refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter

the sanghai praws are good well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud

amongst all their dishes  my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the orange chicken  which is a must must try here this dish is an absolute delight to the minf soul and taste bud this i believe is the most innovative pan asian dish which i have not had in a long time i call this an innovative dish because no other pan asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything

service 45

i believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it is staff here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other kudos to the staff

ambiance  45

as urban asia is a chain of restaurant we were made to sit at their indian counterpart as it was a saturday night and quite late  the interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural india in it is decor which i guess is a perfect combination for the indian restaurant

"this place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that is about it

went on a sunday and there was no crowd at all the ac was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside the service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good the pace of refills needed to improve

i honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course the stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that is about it

it is expensive factoring in the food and service you get these guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment could give it a try for the ambiance though",3,
have been to lunch with friends here today first things ambiance seems to be pretty good i think people just carried on ambiance for this location serving is damn slow even though not much of crowd in the restaurant price is pretty on a higher side virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink we need to ask several times to serve also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters when asked the same was brought later welcome drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad desserts were not so great and not many felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark all in all pathetic service you will literally ask n number of times for food which is served on table not a wide range of dishes taste not so great especially with mock tails totally disappointed,2,
beautiful ambience the vintage look took me back to some good old days the food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order for instance 30 min for a glass of coke we had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban asia and eat india company are together the staff did not attend us for a long time i gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience i had with the people i went with,3,
"instagram  veganyums
drop in to this place with my partner for lunchthey have zomato gold 11 food offer ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attentionliked the quotes on pillars
in starter we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly taste wise it was little bland so there was only cashew taste i could feel
in main course we ordered patiala shahid paneer
which was one of their signature dish which i was expecting to be good in tastebut again i disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamyajwain paratha and naan was good in taste

my experience was not so goodplus staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish",2,
"instagram  veganyums

eat india company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen interestingly in eat india company they also gave the urban kitchen is menu ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient india decorum

when we reach there we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes they were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu

finally we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter the order arrived after 15 minutes plating looks good but tastewise it was well below average the stuffing was too dry even with the chutney it does not taste good

in main course we had patiala shahi paneer quantity was enough to serve two people but again do not expect the taste curry was too ordinary with lot of curry leaves in it

after having such a horrifying experience they included 5 tips for their waiters think before you visit this place and in any circumstance if you are visiting beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill",2,
best one to try for had alacarte and starters were too good with decent quantity and good taste prawns and fish items are must try here which anyone would fall in love with looking forward to try buffet too,5,

nice place
great ambience
food and service is also good
nice place to hangout
quantity and quality is good",4,
"disappointed

went for dinner with friends was bit disappointed with the service and food firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed urban asia nd eat india on the same floor which make service bit slow and confused
we opted for buffet here also they served fusion of both the restaurant for example they served chicken sorba for nonveg and khawsouy for veg
it is simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great",3,
"eat india company eic so this is a very interesting place you go there and first impressions very good when you are seated you get 3 menu cards 4 actually besides eic you are also given the menu of urban asia and tiki shack it is all in one place now dont be surprised if you go there to have in urban asia and are given all three menu cards haha

ok so there was buffet at the eic i scanned thru it and they had very good options there were number of options very intriguing though i had  la cart 

ambience is very good you want to go and see whats on every wall it is interesting lighting is good you get to see what you are eating i have seen some dont have enough lighting not talking about dialogue in the dark here hehe 

taste was good as in ok i have tasted better biryanis at other places all and all it was a good experience nothing like wow or very different it is a good place your regular go out and have good food",4,
"the place gets its name probably from east india company and they have maintained a quite good vintage ambience in there
though the prices are in a bit higher end but thats something you can expect from a brand like urban asia

now talking about the food the varieties offered in both veg and nonveg is quite good and delicious they take there their time to get the food but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed

overall a good place for family as well as to hangout with friends",5,
pretty average fare tried the paneer lababdar and zafrani chicken  just about fine the butter nan had very little butter service is good  the waiters were very attentive and cheerful  eat india company and urban asia share the same kitchen and floor  so one can order from either menusthey also have a buffet on the table however we tried the ala carte,3,
visited this place twice love the food here and the ambience service is also good price is worth the experience  its a must visit restaurant,5,
too costly and food was not up to the cost quantity also very less i will not recommend to go to this place crowd will be less and waiting time also little more,1,
"i have been to eat india company twice to sum up my experience i found the service sloppy and mindless food has fluctuating standards here for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines 
the kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland
the service was so lethargic that i had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 34 tables were booked
the only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer

ps i was pretty excited about going to this place but unfortunately my experience was so bad that i shall never visit this one again",2,
"no proper food wouldnt recommend to anyone
they dont even bother to come when we call them forget about serving us
very bad experience",1,
very bad services i booked table in advance with zomato gold  after taking first order they did not turned up to table to take main course order or to serve water or to clean up table one should not come with family here,1,
we decided to go to eat india company for dinner then found that it in conjunction with urban asia good for us as we got the opportunity to try both the restaurants food was good so was the service prices were moderate to high heard about frozen ice cream and it was a nice try the place is located on the busy foodie street of gachibowli good that valet parking is there taste and prices are decent with good portions,4,
"we visited a day before diwali and we were deploy disappointed
service was poor except for one server who was courteous and smiling
we ordered fresh lime soda which was not sour
starter were okay hence 2 star but main course was pathetic we still could not figure our how they screed up simple thing like paneer butter masala tasteless",2,
it has absolutely nothing for vegetarians there are a couple of starters but that is pretty much it absolutely no variety either for the main course and even the deserts were disappointing  all in all a pretty disappointing experience that felt heavy on the pocket hope you will start considering vegetarians and their palates too,1,
this place is fantastic and the ambiance has a very different concept and the service and staffs treats us as a our friends loved to be in this place,4,
"we had an unhappy dinner really very slow service least interested to bother or care about the customers

waited for 45 mins to be served cold food almost the leftover lack of cleanliness",1,
"if you are craving for some really good food and cheap drinks this is the place to go to

zomato gold is applicable here on food

the ambience is top notch and soothes you

the menu for urban asia is also available here to order from

the staff is friendly too

must go 1010",5,
a nice place to have food with buddies we went for a team lunch and had a nice experience the ambience and food variety are great and the music is continuous and soothing overall we liked this place especially the starters are well cooked and served,5,
the receptionist was very impolite she started shouting at us when we asked her to call her manager the most amazing part was when we were told that manager was very busy and cannot come to us i am not sure what was more important for the manager than customers the restaurant was definitely not on fire and funny business model of not catering to a group of 8 when they had 5 tables for four free,1,
visited this place for buffet lunch with teamthe starters were very goodthey will serve starters on tableeven the main course was goodloved phirni and chico lava cake as wellhowever the ice cream was not goodstaff was courteous as well,5,
want to eat food come to a place where you can eat food big time love life food repeat in love with the best starters and main course,5,
we had a great time with awesome food and great service by sk alauddin i recommend thai coconut soup malaysian laska signature fish phuket sauce,5,
"good foodgoodambiance greatservice pocket friendly
this is what u need to say about this place u can call it as urban asia or u can call it as eat india co easy access to the place good place to hang on with friends",4,
"thank u eat india we had made out day outing we are almost fifteen people and we had enjoyed the ambiance there food and there service food was quick as we went for a buffet and it is a good spread we got a good rate too love to visit this place in the night soonnnnnnnn
i love there ice cream counter 
we will come back soon",5,
very very bad experience i had too worst serving which i never experienced in my life and they were not respecting customers in a good manner,1,
too much of crowd and no one will attend you for quite some time worst experience till date totally waste of time visiting this place you ll leave this place in frustration,1,
worst service and management waiters will not attend you and all you have to do is wait even to get menu card manager is behaviour is totally rude,1,
one of the most irresponsible staff i have ever seem till now the only nice thing happened that receptionist guide to the table after that we waited for almost 10 min but no one attended us even we have called couple of attenders after some time when we spoke to the manager we were shocked at the rude response which made us to leave the place,1,
this place is not even worth 1 star nobody is even attended us for more than 5 min no courtesy of giving menu card even when we spoke the same to manager he himself is rude telling that it will take 5 to 10 min for the waiter is to attend rude manager and worst service absolute no if you are seeking to dine in peace,1,
"had a great time with my friend at eat india company last night along with good food  superb service too thanks to srikanth the tall guys who take good care of us highlight of the evening is murgh angara and thai chicken 
and not to forget the man who leading from the front mr nishant thanks to him for his suggestion to go with buffet love the combination of urban asia eat india
surely we will visit soon",5,
"1 service is too slow
2 chef does not check the dish and throw to customers worst quality for vegetarian food paneer dish  better to have road side in 100 rs
3 spoiled my evening",1,
well it seems that they are juggling all the 3 restaurants the owner own we were given 3 different menu cards one for appetisers one for main course and one for asian cuisine the service was too slow we asked for paneer kadhai instead they served us with sauf filled kadhai of paneer which tasted pathetic the zomato gold benefits were denied as the asian cuisine menu was from the other restaurant of the same owner which was not told to us before we ordered i missed my outstation bus because of this silly confusion of the management overall not a place to go if you want some peace of mind and good food,1,
"had a good time in eat india along with great food the service was excellent as well shout out to sk allaudin who took great care the irani fish was a new discovery and was soft and tasty
the biryani is an all time favourite",5,
we ordered veg thai coconut soup and corn squares which were a highly recommended item on the menu both the items turned out to be utterly disappointing the soup smelled fishy which was not expected in a vegetarian dish and the corn squares tasted were soggy and oily  no crunch or crispiness nobody bothered to ask us about the food or why we had left the soup,1,
"descent place nice and different ambience buffet was ok ok it started on a high note with chicken shorba followed by starters and main course and as we were moving to main course taste of food was not great it was either too much salt or garlic ginger paste

all starters were really nice mutton rogan josh was best thai green curry with steam rice was delicious desert we are hardly available and no one even bothered to refill service was nice over all ok ok may be second visit will think and decide if no option available",3,
been there after seeing the rating it is an absolute no resturant the starters came after 30 min n we always need to remind and followup for serving and its not worth for wait as its tasteless the drink served is like a coughsyrup with a medicinal smell there is absolutely nothing to dine even at chinese side dessert section is something you will not feel to have it you will immediately goto icecream counter where you will wait for 2030 min and finally that fellow will state we dont have that flavour and can only give butterscotch its not that it got over by the time ur turn came it was never there and they made u wait n finally forcing u to have wht he prepared than wht u want finally you will end up paying such huge bucks for drinking water and go straight to office to do lunch at your own office canteen which will look so beautiful than ever before if u dont want to have food but soend money then its a worth resturant to visit,1,
worst food ever very bad taste i will give negative rating no dishes were properly madevery bad experience just name is big but no quality and taste maintained,1,
"if it is dal bukhara in hyderabad it must be eat india company the hot and tantalising dal bukhara when rolled over a garlic naan with tinge of butter spread is an orgasmic treat to the tongue
while the other items were good bukhara was the show stopper  missing bukhara in eic is a big miss you may rather order just bukhara dal and your palette has had its share of joy and would not ask for more ",5,
good ambience but average vegetarian foodit was just like any other restaurantwe order paneer tikka and nawabi handitikka was fine but handi was very average,3,
"been here for sunday dinner buffet i liked the ambiance with lite musicvery peaceful place good for families who like to spend with their loved ones and about food i liked cube corn in veg and fish chicken  prawns in nv i loved the mutton curry it was so tender and delicious and other items were ok one thing they need to improve is service though we opted for buffet they were serving starters at table that too with damn slow service and with repeated reminders
ambiance 45
food 45
service 255
one word review can try once",4,
"lovely decor straight out of an asian paints royale demo house
ceilings were littered with enamel painted doors and the pillars with utensils
absolute cracker of a place
repeat visit is a must",4,
we went there yesterday for a late lunch google showed their closing time and we were going to reach at 315 so we called to confirm and they were ok we ordered a la carte though the food was good it arrived in pieces for eg the noodles came first and the gravy came only only half the noodles were finished the server too looked bit tired indicating it was end of his shift the virgin mojito lacked the freshness and felt like fresh lime 45 star for food 3 star for service,4,
"pathethic service and bad quality of food its hard to give any particular recommendations for this place since neither the ambience the food or service is good anyway

disappointed",1,
"been here for lunch and opted for ala carte

must trys  corn cubes
turn offs  extremely slow service desserts

food  355  tried corn cubes crispy potato with butter chilli garlic sauce paneer lababdar mint and lemon ice cream

corn cubes 55  one of their unqiue dishes simply loved it a highly recommended starters you need to try here

crispy potato 45  tasty and light

paneer lababdar 355  taste was quite different and paneer was fresh the tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it

tandoor roti 35  was hard

lemongrass and mint ice cream 255 i expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors but i was served with these two separately mint ice cream was too strong and we did not like it lemongrass was avg

ambience 45  decent ambience for a family dining

service 25  extremely slow had to remind 23 times to get our order this definitely has to be improvised",3,
"decent ambience with light music taste of food  not that great no much varieties in buffet in all it is not worth the money spent
they really need to keep more varieties
no salads
only 3 desserts including ice cream
so it was an average experience",3,
"on my special day bday i had been there overall it was a great dining experience courteous staff was the strong point here we took a special dinner buffet 45 starters served was delicious less option in main course and dessert though would like to visit here again ",4,
late review ambiance is goodtheme  ancient india with various stuffs i forget the name of the dishes and mocktails most probably 1 chicken and 1 mutton dishes main course main course was good i preferred chicken dish,4,
"being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat
but the restaurant has disappointed
1 ambience and service was great
2 we went for buffet  firstly the starters werent that good at taste common panner kebab type of starter corn  chicken veg kebab well none o them werent good as having them twice
3 main course was a disaster very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten no panner the main dish rice items werent good skipped and went to the desert section
4 desserts was like stabbing a dead man nothing exciting only the ice cream was good

overall it is expensive and less satisfying if you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one",3,
this place served the worst indian food i could ever ask for in hyderabad the towels were dirty and not properly washed the food was just horrible loud music from the pub above will spoil your dining experience even more and when i asked for outdoor seating they lied saying it is only a smokin area not visiting this place ever again an extra star only coz of the interior otherwise this place is just worthy of a 1 star,2,
"eat india company is attached to urban asia
we tried out their buffet
food was decent liked the starters and the main course menu thai green curry was impressive
service was a little slow
i would have liked more variation in deserts
nonetheless a decent meal",3,
so so place you can visit there if you have zomato gold otherwise place does not deserve a special visit location is good and food is average,2,
pathetic a group of 20 people from work visited this place we did not have great expectations at the same time we did not foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be half of us were seated close to the glass facing the gachibowli road thanks to their incredible maintenance the ac was so poor we were all sweating profusely we werent served starters for atleast 40 minutes the choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least the food starters main course desserts tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream we will never be going back to this place,1,
"horrible place
nothing for vegetarians
service is awful
paneer was not properly cooked
corn cubes were hopeless
we had to wait for an hour to get vegetarian starters
the main course for vegetarian dishes was empty",1,
had been here on my birthday and opted for unlimited dinner and have to say till then my birthday was going great because the food was real disappointment including soup starters main course and dessert,3,
"a group of 4 we decided to visit this place on saturday evening the location is quite on the main road however the parking and the entry is terrible they can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turnoff

after entering the restaurant we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor it had a very india taste to it they had old locks keys doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look 

coming to the food there is a plethora of options on their menu instead of going through it all we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer hariyali paneer tikka and corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination corn cubes cannot be missed here my friend ordered a chicken starter which was quite average though moving to main course we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries paneer lababdar mushroom curry and nizami handi seemed like good choices food was decent

the service was not impeccable it ca surely be improved also they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal quite a surprise 

the price point is a little on the higher side probably much more than average  it can be a great negative they accepted gold on food so yay

overall a good experience but probably not one worth visiting again",3,
"good selection of dishes in the menuthe best thing about this place is it is ambience and serving

dambaru the steward who has given the service to the best 

thanks to the team who have organized really good
not but the least the brownies was to yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy


we enjoyed a lot ",5,
i went in for a late night dinner after work i was happy with the service provided best part about this place is their interior the antique royal doors old locks and vintage pictures hanging on the wall and ceiling added to the charm quality and quantity is almost worth the price the ambiance is perfect for a peaceful sumptuous meal i would definitely suggest this place,4,
"if you are wondering what to do on sunday then head to eat india company gachibowli eat india company has been one of my favorite restaurants in hyderabad since years now they have opened a new branch in gachibowli yay to all my office folks everything from the ambience to the dcor to the music is wonderful the quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent i love love love indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you are a meat lover everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum

on sundays the branch at gachibowli teams up with urban asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm urban asia is another brilliant kitchen for asian food if you love chinese and indian food you cannot miss this brunch they have more than 27 dishes with veg and nonveg options plus desserts apart from this they also had chaat and sushi as well when i went all this at 888 per person only what a steal deal my favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab chicken angara kang pao fish mutton rogan josh and of course the dal bukhara for those of you who do not know this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor

make sure to book your table in advance another good tip in case you are someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it is usually not crowded at that time let me know how you like it thank me later",5,
"a family dine in place great ambiane tasty food  nice view and awesome ambiance the place has an ancient indian look with old locks supari cutters old doors on walls and ceiling are amazing its a lovely experience

cheers rakshita nath",5,
"this place has two restaurants in it one is urban aisa and ankther one is etc ambience and entrance was good  food quality and presentation was too good ordered chicken  and mutton biryani here  taste was good  not awesome will visit again

just love this place if you are looking for proper north indian place then this is the place zomato gold takes you to different places and this was one of them tried paneer butter masala butter chicken dal makhani along with breads and pulav definitely worth a visit,4,
visited this place for the good experience we hd earlier at their jubilee hills outlet but at yachi bolu it was a disappointing experiencepurina chutney was sour  methi chicken was bitter do not think will visit again attitude of service staff was ok,2,
"we went here to celebrate a friend is birthday dinner 
the staffs  service interiors and ambience was really great

coming to food it was something 
we all really did enjoy 
although the food preparation time was bit more than we expected
but overall its a must visit place if you wanna hangout with either your office colleagues friends or family 

regards
sakshi",4,
"the best thing about this place is it is aimbence food was good would have been better for it is price gachibowli branch is clubbed with urban aisa zomato gold customers can take advantage of it

"it was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we did not expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure

so it is a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for software professionals and casual lunches with friends

i have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that i had a nice time

so in the spread something that i loved dearly was the chilly prawns i just could not get enough of it it was amazing
the chicken was alright but i can say but prawns were the best although they were really small but can not complain much they did not give us fish even after we asked for it

staff attentive and service was okay

ambience very nice place looks good clean effort was put in to make it look nice

food food was definitely good i liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts they were pretty bad

complaints starting with the ice cream guy they have a cold stone ice cream he broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream technically just mixing it and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away did not wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop for all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop

second is also with the ice cream guy we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately lost our appetite soon after that

third is with one of the waiters probably did not want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu he agreed to get some but never showed up with it i hope it is his memory and nothing else that caused the problem

hopefully management reads this and takes action on it

if those factors are avoided then will go again definitely",3,
great place and wonderful service by dilip we ordered a fist starter and a biryani fish was very good loved the place will visit again for sure,5,
good food amazing service decent enough prices paneer lababdaar and palak paneer are a must try this outlet gachibowli provides you more options since you also can order food from urban asia menu overall a good experience,5,
service is very slow we waited for 30 min for the non veg starter and ended up having lots of time soda and left the dishes had very least salt the chat was bitter,1,
"the whole place was vibrating because of the loud music from the club above completely spoiled the ambiance the food was not great either the atta rumali roti was kachcha butter chicken lacked proper thickness the biryani at jubilee is way way way better wouldnt visit again especially when there is a better alternative in the city

the service was very good no complains about the service very well trained staff",2,
"ambiance 35

service was extremely slow starting from menu to finger bowls to bill we kept calling the waiter and waited for 10 min after every order 
i was under the impression that after gst service charges are removed but i was charged additional 10 service tax 
also axis bank offer as mentioned on zomato site was not given by restaurant",3,
"food is deliciouseven service is goodsk allauddin served very well we ordered
1 chicken sholay
2 paneer lababdar
3 peas pulao
4 tandoori roti and butter naan",5,
urban asia and eat india company are in the same premises stale food slow service oily food water dripping from ac vents on tables and food items really bad experience,1,
"enjoyed the lunch buffet had multiple varieties of starters tasted like awesome there are many variables in main course as well desserts are less in number but should be fine the final ice cream mix was just sumptuous ",5,
food is good but service is pathetic had keep asking for starters but they could not serve all the items at least once finally we gave off,2,
"the food is good the ambiance is good we were greeted by dilip das and he made it an amazing experience for us to dine in over here
surely would like to come again",5,
"had a greater time great ambience coupled with delicious food service was awesomethanks to s k allauddin continue the same cheers ",5,
"let me make it simple 
their brownies are to die for  they have a huge variety of cupcakes but my personal favourite have always been the red velvet and chocolate brownies with walnut topping",4,
"this place has only take aways so i have ordered red velvet creme cheese cake and the cake taste is lip smacking and everyone liked it we even took a box of fresh brownies which are awfully tasty

only lacking thing is this place does not support customization of cakes prices are a bit high but they are worth it as the taste is good",5,
"it is one of the premium bakers in gachibowli most of the items are made on order probably 24 hours prior booking is required i ordered a triple chocolate cake for my husband it was good in taste but nothing extraordinary and came with nice packing

overall you can try their cakes once although it may pinch your pocket",4,
"its a very expensive bakery not like other bakery they dont sell brownies and cupcakes in pieces they sell box of cupcakes and brownies  the brownies are amazing very tasty  they are soft and smooth  love it ",4,
okay so initially i thought it is quite expensive especially for the brownies but i had to try of course i took a risk of taking 2 boxes of assorted brownies for my friends well in a nutshell they loved it and so did i id not think twice about the brownies again cheers,4,
"this place is all about the hype ordered their signature cake  classic chocolate with hazelnuts

good  top cream layer good number of hazelnuts

bad  extremely dry hardly any cream inside the layers

for 2900 it is extremely disappointing",1,
"customer service is zero
they do not know how to behave and dude they do not even have an extra box
the entire store is under renovation how do we know the cookies and cookies are freshly baked
it is expensive too the least you can do is speak properly with the customers well these people they definitely can not
this place only has the hype",1,
"best brownies

labonel box of brownies are freaking expensive but are of good quality purchased a walnut brownie box from here meltinmouth brownies were cakey and moist inside

ps zomato says this place has indoor seating but they do not have any and it disappointed us a lot it is just a take away",4,
"got a box as a gift

trully amazing brownies gotta experience itgoes really well with some good old vanilla ice cream dash of chocolate sauce or even solo",5,
"what a amazing experience very delicious desserts
staff is very friendly hurry to visit to try more treats
very good ambience 1010 for everything",5,
average cakes at a very high price banana bread was very greasy and too sweet staff also not courteous will stick with conc from now on,1,
best brownies and cupcakes in the town that chocolatey feel you will not get anywhere else trust me i feel they are over priced but can spend it,5,
their atmosphere is beautiful and the vibe is amazing tried their cupcakes one of the best in hyderabad especially the red velvet cupcakes it is a bit on the pricier side but definitely worth it,5,
chocolate cup cakes and brownies they were amazing it is fine baking in it is true sense a little high priced but then they bake worth it,5,
very delicious cakes and brownies great quality but a little expensive when compared to the size of the cake range is limited when you reach randomly variety only on order basis,4,
"their tag line fine baking describes this bakery best
really one of the finest bakes i have encountered so far

the chocolate brownie are commendable with the right balance of chocolateiness and fudgeiness in every bite
we also loved the cookies and banana loaf",5,
"a true match for theo is from mumbai one of hyderabad is finest bakery 

the triple chocolate cake is just designed and made to perfection the cake is soft and gooey full of chocolate and provided in amazing packaging

i have been a regular with their brownies they are super light and yet so tasty the only negative is that they come in a box of around 15 pieces as the smallest offering

the cupcakes are a delight as well both red velvet and chocolate slightly high on the price point

always a gotoplace for an excellent experience ",5,
i love the cupcakes from this place vanilla  chocolate and redvelvet combo is awesome cakes are also delicious the only thing lacking is variety,4,
"i ordered a pack of combo cupcakes of vanilla  chocolate and red velvetnone were upto the marki was attracted towards it good reviews and wanted to give it a shot but none of the cupcakes were soft
the icing on top tasted only sugar and the cream was stalethe cake was not spongy at alli really do not understand how it has such high rating heretotal waste of moneymy first and last visit today",1,
love the cakes and the brownies brownies are a must try red velvet and chocolate cakes here make me go nom nom nom initially the price point may seem high but each bite redeems more than each buck spent,5,
an excellent place with mind blowing taste i can say each and every item is of high quality and it is worth the price tag if someone is really tired of conventional desserts it is the place for you to try something new the taste will make you feel the fuming power of their tagline finebaking,5,
"nice place for desserts tried their red velvet cheese cake which was okayish as i am not a fan of the same anyway and had packed a chocolate cake the cake was really tasty and filling it had that rich taste of chocolate and the texture of the cake was amazing it was packed very well
these guys are great with their quality and presentation",4,
"when we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it

my sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds labonel fine baking in high regard keeping this in minds we thought a labonel cake will make her birthday more special

we ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day we also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd sept till 6pm this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm

they decide to call me on the day of pickup at 450pm to inform me that they will shut down at 530pm so not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment is notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store

well since the cake held sentimental value for me i did leave immediately and rushed to the gachibowli store i made it there by 510pm and can you imagine my dismay when i saw that the store was closed to add to it no one answered the phone
i stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response

i could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional if they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments i do not think it would ever matter how their product is

my sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products

since they did not contact me back even the next day i feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post i hope this falls on deaf ears of labonel owners

i know i will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this you have been warned 

update i have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences",1,
"these cupcakes are so soft fresh chocolaty delicious they are totally not overhyped and their store is so pretty too they should have one of these in bombay i can not keep asking my friends to get them for me ",5,
after going through the amazing reviews i tried red velvet cupcakes honestly it is not worth at all the frosting on cupcake was not fresh it tasted below average cake not worth the money,2,
everything here is delectable to the last bit prices are bit on the higher side which makes it a little difficult for people on budget however you should definitely try their samples which is kept at the counter to satisfy your taste buds for free d,5,
"i have never denied i have sweet teeth you read that right not tooth  teeth i take every opportunity to indulge in sweets because it makes me happy this bakery makes me happy

cupcakes that edge sweet without being overpowering so i can share with the i do not like desserts that are actually sweet crowd do not be surprised if you gulp down the entire box in a sitting

a fine carrot cake cupcake that almost makes you feel like you are eating healthy until you eat the luscious cream cheese frosting that is one of my top favorites

life is short  eat sweets buy them here be happy",5,
"i absolutely love ordering from this place for all special occasions i make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever i am visiting my parents
this place is pretty expensive and there is no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year it is so worth it
i have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but i have tried their sample cakes multiple times and i can not wait to order them
note they usually need advance orders so give your order on time and they are closed on sundays so make sure that you call and confirm before making the trip",5,
"i ordered a triple chocolate cake it is one of the premium bakers in gachibowli most of the items are made to order probably 24hrs prior booking is required found only some sweet items good packing taste is good cost is at the higher end

theglobetrotterladycom",4,
absolutely loved the brownies from here it is a treat to the taste buds and so so so good moist soft and just perfectly made it is sure to lift your spirits anytime,5,
beautiful cake with great flavors we ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting it was really delicious it had a slight hint of cinnamon unlike usual cakes with overwhelming flavors it was mild and tasty it also had some amazing unique flavors which we would love to try on our next trip to this cute place,4,

no trip to hyderabad was ever complete without a visit to labonel back when i did not live here i am so glad they have expanded and started a branch in gachibowli i hope they start a delivery service soon",5,
"very renowned place for bakery the cakes are very soft
tried red velvet brownie recently it is like burfi which melts in mouth the sweetness is just perfect",5,
pathetic staff and no courtesy gives only big cakes not slices utter stupidynot warm welcome and even does not offer any other options as a token of good customer service or does not even offer any other options this not the way to function as a service industry,1,
"having labonel brownies since childhood the best after theobroma thoughp
chocolate brownies are my favourite 
red velvet is also nice tried marble cake also which is decent
the best part of labonel is its flawless packing
good for gifting",5,
extremely rude staff at this outlet labonel admin and of course the place is overhyped  i have had some amazing cakes at stores that charge way lesser and have better staff they honestly do not care about their customers do yourself a favour and head out to a much better cake shop there are plenty trust me,1,
"used to be run by an expat french lady in banjara hills 
 great thing about it is that they are maintaining the same quality even today after all these yaers
 brwonies are legendary
 carrot cake is truly amazing with just the right hint of cinnamon not easy to get this right
cup cakes and cookies are amazing too
red velvet cup cake is highly recommended",4.5,
"its been long and really long that i am trying my hands on la bonel cup cakes and specially red velvet cup cakes  i always go ahead and buy a box for myself and loved ones  red velvet cup cakes  la bonel u r lovely ",4,
my boyfriend had gotten a cheese cake for my birthday from here as i am a big cheese cake fanatic and to be honest i did not like it much i would prefer a cheese cake from fsm but i love their cup cakes and red velvet cake they are tasty i would recommend to try them but not for the cheese cake four is for cup cake,4,
i am from mumbai visited this place after hearing wonderful reviews and purchased for 2450 too however i have never seen such an arrogant and non courteous staff hope your good baking does not bring in arrogance,2,
always a lovely experience visiting labonel it is definitely one of the best patisseries in hyderabad and every branch of it is lives upto the expectations,4,
"picked up the box of cupcakes containing vanilla chocolate and red velvet cupcakes and trust me it is the best you might have ever had their packing is very classy firstly adding to the elegance of those little cakes i loved all three equally but the smooth taste of chocolate  i can never forget that you will not regret gaining those calories ",4.5,
"the cake i bought started smelling bad the very nxt day  seriously u charge 2200 for a cake n dats da way u make it n not to forget the hair strand i get from it ",1.5,
fine baking it is place looks classy it is expensive for a takeaway staff at the counter was not very warm cupcakes are good especially the chocolate ones only drawback is they let you buy in specific flavours and quantities and you do not get to pick and choose your favorite ones berry crumble loaf is one of my favorites,4.5,
labonel has been an old favourite for many years their cookies and brownies are always in high demand from anyone visiting from out of town to take away however would highly recommend trying some of their made to order menu items such as the fudge cake chocolate pie and chocolate roulade,5,
"we ordered a cake for my niece birthday

loved the coco vanilla cake this place is so classy the guy on tills is very decent and friendly will surely come back",5,
"had very high expectations from this place given the great reviews it has got however in my opinion it is just overhyped not so great if you have been to any theobroma outlet in mumbai you will realize how this place is full of shit the brownies are very average tea loaf is worse one word  underwhelming

plus rude staff",2,
"amazing red velvet browniemelts in your mouth and a must try
cupcakes are nice but brownie is a clear winner
prices are a bit high
got few boxes of cupcakes and brownie",4.5,
please mention either on the menu card or on any food app that we dont serve single piece of cake we serve only a whole cake so that people dont waste their time coming at your outlet,1,
"one of the best bakeries in hyderabad i say one of the best because i am trying to find something to match it and have not been able to the brownies are amazing their cakes are really good

lobonel does not bake it makes magic and the taste lingers

mustgo place in hyderabad you can not miss it",5,
"although i have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place i can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about hochnsig is a word that came to my mind when i visited this place the first few times hoch is high and nsig comes from nose this german word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as hochnsig does however that is not all they are they are in fact one of the best bakeries in hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from i said one of the best and not the best for three reasons

1    this place is expensive
2    except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake everything must be ordered at least a day in advance
3    they do not sell cakeslices you must buy the entire cake which you must order in advance

now coming to the gooooooood stuff

brownies
the best i have ever had the chocolate is rich deep and the brownie itself is light moist and almost melts in your mouth i know some of you may say that that is not how a brownie is supposed to be that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right but try this one for the flavor and its meltinyour mouth quality

chocolate cakes
i have tried one of their classic chocolate cake and triple chocolate cake all the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies so each one of them is rich moist with an excellent deep chocolate flavor the best one is clearly the triple chocolate cake

carrot cake
to me there are two kinds of carrot cakes one is the desi kind that you get at parsi bakeries which is moist dense has khoyamava and cardamom even the other kind is the fancier videsi version which has nuts mostly walnuts cinnamon a creamcheese frosting and is drier labonel being a fine baking place naturally has the latter kind although i am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon which in my mind always overpowers any dessert labonel is carrot cake is the best i have ever had in this category

cheesecakes
i have only had one of their cheesecakes blueberry i think it was a right amount of fluff fat sweetness and flavor the base was delicious too however the cheesecakes at eclat or chili is are slightly firmer hence a bit better

cupcakes
cupcakes are their only product that i am not a fan of they are too small the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake you can give the cupcakes a complete miss

cookies
chocochip double chocolate and white chocolateraspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake soft rich moist chewy and yummmmmmm

miscellaneous
there are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake the honey cake is ok but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy

overall if you do not mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me then do not give this place a miss",4.5,
"brownielove   bakedwithlove

classic calm interior i loved their theme color blue packaging is sober and royal an excellent house warming present 

brownies were soft chocolaty and yum yum yum they were simply the best 
one has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 45 days per brownie it costs 50 good deal for a group of 67 people however not so good deal for single personloner 
place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie 

suggestion 
i do not want to go and eat chocolava in dominos on cheat day instead i want to have brownie here 
why not offer a single piece or small one person box 34 pieces may be",4,
brownies cupcakes and their blueberry cheesecake i would give all of it a 1010 the blueberry cheesecake is just too cheesy that it certainly melts in your mouth,5,
ordered a vanilla fudge cake for my wife is bday the cake was okayish at best the frost was very sweet like the ones you get in cheap ones the layers were soft but not something which would just melt in your mouth all in all the cake was not worth its price and hype disappointed,2.5,
"awesome cakes and cookies worth every penny good ambiance although outlet is not that biggood service delivery on time till now i have tried cakes only will visit soon to try cup cakes and other cookies i am searching for red velvet cake i hope they met my expectationskeep up the good work ",4.5,
amazing never had so delicious brownie its so so soft that it just melts in ur mouth n is chocolaty the cup cakes are also amazing u cannot ahve a single piece here u have to take a full box of 15 pcs whatever u take one must must have it,4.5,
"this place is fine baking indeed classy outlet as well with very foreign inspired interiors
their chocolate chip cookie is very good chewy and tasty
the honey chocolate cake is a good bet for your evening snack
the cupcakes here are my all time favorite choclate feels better than the red velvet
their brownie is also one of the best in hyderabad and is quite a good option for gifting people as well as being a recepient of such a box of delight",4.5,
"i have ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting their online menu says it is their signature cake it was the worst cake i ate till date it is just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere and of course cream cheese frosting there were simply too many kismiss in there i hated every bit of that cake
i have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight 35 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all how much ever i say it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake",3.5,
had their classic brownie cake which is served on a box the brownies are fine but too expensive for their taste i would say there are other outlets with lower prices but tastier brownies,3.5,
"i am in love with cup cakes and labonel made it much more romantic 
the cream and the bread are just perfect and the flavours are amazing though i felt it a bit over priced it did not come to my mind as long as i was indulged in eating them it would be great experience worth the price you must try them
next target their brownies 
the only thing i would like to be changed about this place is that they should have menu options for the customers to eat there itself it is such a beautifully designed place and just takeaway makes the experience unfinished",5,
"one of best brownies that i have tasted
little expensive though look forward to visit again when next time in hyderabad
very polite gentleman whom i met ",4.5,
"there is no better place to satisfy your dessert cravings than this heavenly place the labonel i love their cake measuring schemes unlike kilos  one must have to forget about calories strictly when you visit this place

my favs are brownies red velvet dark chocolate white chocolte and all cup cake versions they are so soft melts in mouth just so yummm in tummy

yes they are very expensive almost costs a bomb  5500 rs for a birthday cake but its all worth it once a while for any of your grand special occasion go treat your tastebuds at labonel ",4,
very poor store management ordered for an eggless cake on friday 05th may 2017 and they confirmed my order before the pickup i just called them to check if the cake is ready and they simply say there is no order on my name at all this is pure irresponsibility on the part of labonel gachibowli thank you for spoiling my day,1,
"the best tasting and expensive baking place

the brownies are top rated and even the chocolate cakes too but with a expensive tag

if you like to order a chocolate cake classic chocolate cake is the best

if you are not worried for the price tag this is a must try place",4,
i quit cakes after trying their fruit cakethe kind of cake which will make you think twice before celebrating an occasionthe cake had two ingredients cream and sadnessdo yourselves a favour and go to conu instead,1,
"i absolutely love the red velvet cupcakes from labonel they are the best although i am from bombay i would rate these cupcakes to be the best in the worldand trust me i try red velvet cupcakes  cookies everywhere i travel they beat theobroma in bombay hollow 

even their brownies cakes are the softest most sumptuous ones ever must buy several boxes every time you visit hyderabad",5,
"they make the best red velvet cake and cup cakes in hyderabad 
their chocolate cake is very rich and gooey buy my first preference has always been red velvet 
their brownies are my husbands fav
their packaging and all are high end so best for gifting 
but they do not customise the cake according to your taste you have got to take what they have 
only downside is  its a over priced  so occasional indulgence is what i go with in order to satisfy my sweeth tooth ",3.5,
the best brownie i had till date it is not like those regular brownies it has a different taste and softness i also tried their cupcakes but nothing can beat their brownies very fancy packaging perfect to gift someone,4,
"absolute bliss to have a brownie or cake from here
have made it a point to order cakes for all my special events from this place thumbs up for the quality and taste",5,
"absolutely the best bakery in the area hands down

the cakes from this place are kept hidden in pgs and quads because they are totally worth the fight as well as arguments right now when i am writing the review i am salivating remembering the taste of the brownies",4.5,
best place in town for brownies they were so good that i ended up eating an entire box by myself i heard very good feedback on their cakes as well,5,
"have tried cup cakes from so many other places but i have not got the cup cakes anywhere like here

red velvet and chocolate are our favourites",5,
"love the blueberry cheesecake takes you to heaven complete foodgasm achieved i think they should keep pastries too
cupcakes and cookies are a must try
min order is 10pcs
thats the only setback for people craving for a sweet tooth overall superbb",4.5,
"one of the premium bakers in gachibowli most of the items are made to order probably 24hrs prior booking is required found only few cupcakes brownies ready and that too it is for takeaway can not dine in bought the chocolate and red velvet brownies cost for 1kg around 800 or so good packing taste is good but there are places which serves better brownies
cost is at the higher end",3.5,
"delicious chocolate brownies the packaging is awesome too
been wanting to visit ever since i heard about the banjara hills branch but somehow never got the chance to
the price is a bit steep though but an occasional indulgence which the product is meant for anyway is perfectly fine 
i am not too good with dessert consistency and stuff but all i can say is this is a place i would definitely recommend for dessert treats and parties
the brownies are moderately sweet and rich and not too moist

i will be back for the cupcakes",4.5,
"i have been lusting after this place after reading too many 5 star reviews on zomato  so yesterday the occasion was right  and i was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my so unfortunately i was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer the staff at labonel do not know anything about customer servicethey were very rude and mean to us i wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if i was there to steal their products very impatient and unwilling to help and also their phone number never works tried calling several times and never got a response anyways coming to food i only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes the price burnt a hole in my  pocket only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs the flavors are vanilla chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting i tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and i  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless yes it was like eating a spongei am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge nothing but just hype  i have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries  

final note never ever  going to visit the place again overrated place",2,
labonel has become a hotspot for premium and rich baking the taste is amazing and makes you indulge in more tasted red velvet cake on my friends birthday and it makes you go ummmmmm,3.5,
"definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason amazing cakes and brownies it is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever
my personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them i did not like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people is taste brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes",3.5,
it is a delight for dessert lovers slightly expensive but awesome stuff ordered a cake for my wife from here recently and that cake is probably one of the best ones i have ever had a must visit place,4.5,
we have brought cakes from labonel jubilee hills many times and it has always been great on christmas we tried labonel gachibowli plum cake the cake was very good and the dried fruits were of very good quality totally enjoyed the cake,4.5,
absolutely delighted with our overall experience the shop had an excellent festive decoration ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception the moment we entered the place along with it is festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place they mostly have ready cakes cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later the price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes we were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted the brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor this was one of the best brownies i have had in a long time we also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well want to try everything in the menu in future keep up the great work will definitely recommend,5,
i have been to banjara hills outletit was so difficult to find it is exact locationno sign or board or anythingi literally had to ask someone aroundi had no idea it has been closed and i have not been to gachibowli outlet but anyway i wanted to write something about laboneli do not know where it is situated at gachibowli  i do not know about the ambience  i have not tried there cakes yet which i had heard from many ppl that they are beautiful  tastyanyway but i did try there cupcakes  brownies when they were still open at there old locationi must say i was not impressedthere are lots of praises about the cupcakes in the reviews over here but it was not worth the expectationmind u guys i have a sweet tooth so naturally i will be having high expectationsthey are bit too pricy and with that price they are giving tiny cupcakesthey were tasty not like wow but come on if ur keeping the price tag so high atleast increase the number of cupcakes in the boxsame is the case with browniesif they really want to attract large number of customers they should reduce the pricei do not know how they are still surviving,2.5,
"there isnt much i can say about labonel that hasnt been said already
the bakery is just fantastic and has some of the best brownies and cupcakes you could hope for
red velvet brownies are really great and something different that not every place offers
the packaging makes for a great gift so give it a go even birthday cakes can be ordered here a little costlier than usual options but superb in terms of taste no doubt  atleast a day before preorder",4.5,
"most importantly the cake tasted like heaven i had ordered for the classic chocolate cake as suggested by the person attending me and it was true love especially for the people who are chocolate fanatics like me
the ambiance is very sophisticated and the decorations are really good
the only thing i did not like is that you just cannot wake up one day realizing you want at little bite of the amazing cake you had as the minimum requirement for ordering a cake is 1 kg and they do not keep pastries ",4.5,
its a made to order cake shop we got some cupcakes and cookies from here cookies were nice it had to be it costed something 650 for a box of 15 cupcakes were just average,3,
the cupcakes were really good soft and creamy their cookies also felt very different and almost melted in the mouth the only drawback is the quantity which you need to buy for an order as it is purely a takeaway restaurant one last thing labonel is not light on your pocket,4,
i dont know much about gachibowli branch but banjara hills branch has the worst costumer service that i have ever seen in my life very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place they have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve my whole party got ruined because of their so called great service i have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery ofcourse there was none i was okay with it and said i will collect it from their store i almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my  order and due to heavy traffic i reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time i kept giving them information about how far i am and that i would reach them in less time i requested them to wait for 5 minutes as i was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills they answered my call at 900 when i was near gvkone i said i will come in 5 min they said they will wait but by the time i reach their place everything was locked i called them 100 times and their was no response what an awful service if you have a big party please do not rely and order anything from this place worst experience,1,
superlative i have been here once and the taste hasnt left me since i love their brownies they are super yummy and the texture is something i have never been able to find anywhere else yet it is a melt in the mouth treat just the right amount of everything in it i also loved their assortment of cupcakes worth a try,5,
"updated review
ever since my first visit to labonel i have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too this cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes chocolate vanilla and red velvet all the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top they are definitely at the top of their game right now
ps the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste

previous review
a class apart fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle labonel holds a very different sophisticated yet very pleasant aura all this while i avoided this sweet gem coz i assumed it is hell expensive considering cost for two stated as 3000 but that is certainly not the case
because i was in a hurry and dint have time to try test and enquire about all the items i quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies heavenly decadent sinful melt in the mouth luxurious delectable delightfuli can go on and on raving about this piece of art i do like to clear the air about misconception of labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not a box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering p
with suvi kanchan",4.5,
"these brownies literally melt in your mouth
red velvet and vanilla cupcakes are scrumptious
but i really wish we could sit down and eat 12 pieces in the bakery makes you think twice about going to labonel because you have to get an entire box each time  it is nice to see that a great amount of effort is put into the packaging and presentation of labonel is products",3.5,
the classic chocolate brownies of labonel are like heaven they are extremely soft and melt in your mouth the cookies are yummy too the interiors are very well done up and pleasing to the eye with the classic vintage decor the only sad part is that they do not sell the brownies per piece and you need to buy an entire box,4.5,
one day my husband got this yummy brownies in a exotic looking packet and i really had to google to know details about this storethats what labonel ismust say they make awesome pastries,5,
"best bakers of hyderabad 
the cup cakes are so tasty and pan cakes for birthdays are so delicious
choco brownies and chocolate cakes are so worth for its higher price",4.5,
awesomedeliciousmouth watering  do not know what else i could say for the tasteit is a place where you have to spend more but once you taste their cake i am sure you will forget what you paidone of the best i hadi wish they were in another cities as i keep travelling,4.5,
hands down the best cup cakes and brownies in hyderabad they do not compromise on quality and you can feel that in the rich flavors and amazing taste we had even ordered a cake from their for one of our directors birthday and good did that cake fly after it was cut pricing is a bit on the higher side but totally worth it,4.5,
this place stays in the best 5 bakeries in the city for chocolate cake for surehad ordered and picked up a 3 layer chocolate cake irrespective of pricing its tasting made everyone stun shock its truly a classic chocolate cake the only con is pricing but worth the money for the taste do not miss the chocolate cake,4,
"i went to labonel a long time ago

there has always been a lot of hype about labonel especially for their cupcakes i personally disliked the red velvet cupcakes because of the buttercream frosting second the cupcakes were available only in boxes and not individually which was not cost effective or practical at all

however i tried their brownies at a later point through a friend is purchase they are quite delicious i would definitely have more but wouldnt go through the effort of buying a whole box",3.5,
seems like your in a classic movie from the 60s when you walk in what a decordeserts are splendid worth the money you pay ordered the classic chocolate cake yummmmm,4.5,
we went to have coffee at this place they have such awesome ambience coffee was fantastic and mushroom corn and jalapeo pizza was out of this world plus you can actually book sports bikes and cars from this place and if you have the moolah can take lamborghini for a ride i am going for 45 for this hell of a place,4,
"driven is a bike themed cafe where you can even take bikes or luxury cars for rent

this is located in the busiest it areas of hyderabad this is one of the places that is open till late night in this area

though the food is good here but certainly overpriced

their cold coffee is really good but the brownies need to be a little soft",3,
"best place for hangouts and chats
ordered capuccino  not so great and okay  can be done better
chilli cheese toast  55  i liked it for its taste and cheesiness",3,
been there for the first time though it was for few mins i was just amazed with ambience and musicthe staff was very patient and order was quick,4,
i visited here last week with my friend the pizza was awesome along with the dessert pasta was fine along with latte the desserts are really good,4,
we went at 630 am here because we found that this place is open at this time but we met with disappointment as there was nothing we could eat or drink as the place was just open and serving almost nothing,1,
"i am not a big fan of sports bikes but i totally loved the place
the interior and lightening is really soothing
i preferred sitting on the first floor as it gave a better view of the place
for food we ordered a chilli garlic toast chocolate donut with mocha frappe and vanilla frappe

individual rating
food 45 the donut was not upto the mark
service  55 it is self service but my order was ready in like 5 minutes
pocket friendly  45 the portion size was really small for the money they were charging
ambiance  45

i really wanted to give this place a 45 star but that cannot happen on zomato now",4,
such a unique concept this cafe has of hiring bikes and cars and enjoying coffee along with it ambience is too cool and food is also nice really loved my visit there,5,
i went this place with a lot of expectationsi travelled 30 kms with full of curiosity and then when i reached the cafe i ordered my food and went exploring the cafe it was good with all bikes and cars surrounded by it the theme of the cafe was too good but i waited for 30 min bcoz the top floor of cafe was under maintenance to see ambience of cafe i waited there and when i went upto there i find some intresting stuff i am satisfied with you btw the food was some what good,4,
"late night craving for some coffee and chocolate driven cafe be it

this is a great place to hangout the interior is amazing done  looks fabulous the beverages offered are really great also the pizza is awesome although they could add more things to the food menu that will make it better overall a very much recommended,4,
"i love this place perfect place to have coffee atleast for me spacious evergreen english songs eg nirvana bryan adams on the back ground it is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit talk sip coffee enjoy the background songs not a noisy cafe like some other cafes this cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city

but the negative point is that they do not have much items on the food menu which is why i gave only 3star

recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items",3,
reviewing after a long time because this was really specialme and my husband went on a long drive and when i suddenly had the craving to have a nice cup of coffee this place happened the ambiance was really cozy and differentwe ordered cup of tea  coffee and pizza the best part was the heart shaped almond choco pastryloved the theme and concept of cars and bikes,4,

"one best place for indoor photoshoot coming to food its just so yummy  pasta  and pizza  been here 2 times and wish to visit many more times ",5,
"the first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambience you have a triumph thunderbird lt on one side with it is massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red there is great music playing and there is riding gear etc hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it 
i went in early morning around 830 the cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside ac switched off probably there was no one behind the counter asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order 

ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll the guy was coughing randomly hopefully not into my food or drink but i found this to be an annoyance i mean you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there are not trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness it all goes to waste 

the mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was okish as i paid i got a torn note so i gave it back to exchange it of course instead the guy just took it and went away i waited for a while then called out asked for my money and instead of one note he handed over two the dude was clearly in his sleep  probably having been through the night shift

giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food 1 point taken away for the serving attendant 

oh and they do not have anything nonveg",4,
"i was here with my bunch of friends a few days ago i was in awe with this place and i guess anyone who visits here would also be by the beautiful big toys this place has from luxurious cars to super sexy sports bike anything you want to rent this place has
coming to the food they do not have much variety it is just pizza pasta sandwich and desserts we had ordered veg pizza loved it loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust four cheese pizza i did not like it that much made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust veg sandwich nailed it it was the most yummiest one for me paneer sandwich my friends loved it i do not eat paneer so i can not say that for myself white sauce pasta it was good more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me
coming to drinks i ordered cool blue slush and i loved it taste wise  another reason being it took too long to sipped up fully
overall it was a good experience for me",4,
"this place is one of the coolest drivein in financial district it peoples can hope for a cool hangout place around the cornerbest place to catch your frenchy moments 
coffee loverhazelnut",5,
please do not use penne pasta in your mac and cheese dish we ordered cheese toast and brownie as well but the food was not up to the mark the ambience was good though,1,
we ordered cold coffee and capacuino the cold coffee was not cold and the capacuino was not hot disappointed with the temperature of the coffees served i would give a 4 for its ambience received a very small piece of chilly cheese toast ccd serves better coffees,3,
"super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype we ordered
mint mocha  which tasted ok
chocolate bomb  tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate
mushroom sandwich  overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche
coffee crunch  it was good because i like chocolate and coffee combo but for the price the drink itself not that rich
few good points
vegetarian cafe
good location
good music
they buzz you when your food is ready

all i can say is and i am saying this because i believe that everything can get better if you put effort driven cafe dont drive us away with your bad food we dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent and your selling point is not the ambience you dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low there is so much competition out there you have to revup your game
serve good food and bring your reputation up challenge accepted",2,
first thing which strikes is the ambience and the big toys everyone who will visit this place for sure wld be in awe of the ambience and the big toys i was in hurry and only had cappuccino and it was very good and specially 100 bucks for a cappuccino like that bang on but i was not impressed by the service it can surely be improved,3,
"this place is one of the coolest drivein in financial district right in the front of kapil towers it peoples only hope for a cool hangout place around the corner
they have pretty decent menu including iced teas frappes and various choice of leaf teas
they have many impressive sides too
must try chilli cheese toast and donuts
choco almond bomb for sweet tooth is a must try",4,
"the ambiance is good it can be given 45
perfectly located in the it hub
the timings are wonderful actually
the food and drinks are priced high but still it is a worth to visit place",4,
"overrated and hyped
this place is known for its rusty garagelike interiors where you can rent some top notch automobiles the cafe in driven cafe is rather disappointing staff is not very friendly nor very observant to details they ask for extra money for everything even when the coffee costs similar to expensive coffee chains i had mocha and coffee crunch both of which were average at its best and werent something that i would remember",2,
"nice ambience and helpful staff
pizza is also good  the quality of cheese in pizza can be slightly better i feel coffee even with an extra shot did not give a strong aroma though",3,
ambience is quite good and this place is nearby to my office i was disappointed with the food though certainly  dint reach to my expectations and the blue berry cheese cake that i had in other cafe is was wow  but the one here was bland  the shakes were good compared to the rest that i ordered service was good so i would give a 45  food  25 ambience  45,3,
"driven cafe is the new age ccd
govthere chill as much as you want and call for one of their low standard of coffee
the brew is not great and the veg servings are not good enough for a meal
they really need to up the game wrt fnb
the car bike game is real strong",3,
ordered tea but received milk,1,
"to all bike and car lovers this is the best place to hang out and also to rent amazing sport cruiser naked street bikes and cars

best place to chill and find many bikers here every food ordered is amazing and ambience makes fall in love with machines and the way they blend this into it

overall 4",4,
love this place from the word go i always wanted to visit this cafe since it is launch everything about this place is super cool  be it the timing concept ambiance or the quality of coffees and snacks served i visited this place on a bright sunday morning and just fell in love with the place as i got a seat right next to muscular triumph they have great collection of cars and bikes which even one can hire on rent i ordered hazelnut coffee paneer kulcha and my friend ordered some dry fruits crispy sweet croissant along with coffee paneer kulcha was too good and coffee was just fine would visit this place again soon,4,
"after a lot of recos and solid rating everywhere i finally tried out driven cafe  mainly to sample their coffee unfortunately i was disappointing with the cappuccino tried a medium cappuccino  which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk and it was very underwhelming no aroma no kick it was very bland and generic had a hard time getting through it 
the wife tried frappe which was as per her taste and my daughter who has a major sweet tooth found her choco chip brownie nice however i was quite disappointed overall",3,
"must visit place for supercars and super bike lovers these fantastic machines will definitely enthral your looks coming to the ambience the environment of the place looks like you are literally sitting in a garage between few superbikes the blackcurrant milkshake tasted really great but the pizza did not taste that good if it was made a little spicy it would be great but the chilly flakes saved it from being a total disappointment
can definitely give this place a try",4,
the food was not at all good though the ambience was very nice and soothing to the eye the food was just bad we ordered chili cheese toast chocochip brownie and chocochip cookies except for the cookies nothing was good while the brownie tasted like some kind of medicine the toast was just too hard and very difficult to chew,1,
if midnight hunger strikes you driven cafes are the best place to rush to aura is compact and beautiful and the playlist they play is quite catchy i was really amused to visit this place last night,4,
the place is good and the ambience too but the food is expensive and lacks tastefor bike lovers it is a place to try on and just have a normal breakfast can not prefer more than that,3,
"the best thing about this cafe is that it is open 24x7
there are lot of beverage options a few bakery options and very little food options the ambiance is great for bike enthusiasts but if you are not one it is only average for you they play really good music though
the food is only average",3,
"the ambience is quite a steal such interiors and those amazing cars and bikes lined up outside  a must visit for bikers cause they even have fancy merchandise inside

this place being really close to our residence we are frequent visitors the best part is that it is open late in the night hours you can just have a drink and chill in the outdoor seating area pure bliss

i have tried the cafe mochamint mocha strong minty flavour hot chocolate all equally good the snacks are quite average and can be avoided the chilli cheese toast is a disappointment

sizzling brownie was yum and so was pesto pasta though it was slightly overpriced


one of the cool places to enjoy and try different coffee drinks i must say ",4,
this place excites me everytime i go my most fav midnight hangout place with friends i have been a fan of this cafe not just because of the bikes cars and badass ambience but their excellent coffes too they serve one of the hyderabad is best espressos along with few other cold coffees and shakes but there are less snacks options my suggestion would be to increase the snacks options and adding some exotic desserts like sizzling brownies,5,
"well
drove for 1 hour to reach this place
only destination we got was disappointment
the mahool as we say is cold
staff is frozen
food is archaic

much better cafs around in hyderabad
this one is not one of them",1,
great place to spend time nice ambience and music i am an automobile enthusiast and this place is really nice super cars and bikes on rent are parked outside the fruit cakes and coffee flavours are also nice some variety of drinks are not available at timea which is a turn down but good place to relax and sip coffee,4,
"what is not to love here  the best and the most amazing combination of carbike and coffee
soo you have to to visit either if u like sporty bike and luxurious cars or coffee is life for you 
it has rustic ambience which you will fall for and service is quite fast ",5,
"it is my late night stop when i am in need for a coffee have been there dozen of times the most eye catchy thing about the cafe is the super bikes and cars parked outside the cafe has a rustic ambiance and is decorated with bikes and posters

i usually end up having a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate i loved them both

so if you are craving for a coffee in the middle of the night then this is the place to go not only this they have amazing cars and bikes for rent

so a must visit place  ",4,
nice place coffee is nice stays open till midnight which is great for people who work late night and are in need for a good coffee we had double chocolate decadent which is ok as we had better before plus it does not look like it is made fresh coffee was nice as it can get better,3,
i was really impressed with the ambience and the simple menu options available they say rightly that simplicity attracts the most i was able to spend some quality time here in the evening starting with coffee and ended with desert will definitely plan to visit again,4,
omg i will not forget this place forever i usually visit this place at least once a week all thanks to my coworkers who makes my visit more memorable and refreshing this place serves decent coffees and frappes i would give 5 for ambience and 4 for coffee and food being a coffee freak could not resist to come down to this place,5,
this is a good place to have some quick food etc and you can find all varieties and prices are also not much overall it is a good place ambience could be better but given the nature of business it looks good,4,
its,1,
"the coffee was really nice i ordered cafe latte with caramel hazelnut irish and chocolate i believe ",5,
feeling hungry or want to chill with your friends then this cafe is the final stop for your late night hunger if you are a car or a bike lover  you will love this place  this place has a raw metallic look and offer luxurious cars and bike for rent  now comes the food it serves a wide range of snacks and teacoffee which is good in taste,4,
the one and only best place to chilll out with super cars and super bikes on weekends is this driven cafe and the food is also super awesome here but lil expensive but food worth it you can drive the super cars and super bikes in this cafe by taking it for rent for some time but the place is super awesome with supercarsandbikes superweekends,5,
two thumbs up for coffee one of the most authentic places for coffee in hyderabad tried and tasted all the flavors as a coffee connoisseur they made me happy   a quick meeting with cheerful and smiling ashwin jain was a bonus the service was impeccable ultimate customer delight snacks could be better though,4,
"one of the second best places for me to have coffee in hyderabad after starbucks the ambience of the cafe is awesome with all the superbikes and super cars the service is decent and the its quite reasonable to spend on coffee and food the most interesting part is about the interiors of the cafe where it is all metallic and the paintings are awesome

i ordered the cafe frappe it was super diluted read water  and tasteless such a disappointment,1,
good place to chill out  lots of space the ambience is very nice live music  menu has lots of tea and coffee options  tastes good  a little on the expensive side  varieties of coffee also displayed,4,
"my go to cafe for any discussion or meeting have been to this place more than 10 times by now and never get disappointed
the ambience stands out from all the nearby places with whole garage theme if you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well too much innovation and thinking is just mind blowing the wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic the cherry on top is their songs selection

all the coffees taste great especially the fact you get it even after midnight although my personal favourites are flat white and cappuccino the quite bites available as paneer kulcha is recommended as well 

do not forget to take good camera along with you while going here",5,
what catches your eyes could be the expensive cars and super bikes which you could rent but once you enter inside the place  you have to flex your muscles to push the door which has a heavy chain you get a good feeling the place offers you some interesting food options to choose from and the garage feeling gives a huge rush the antique furniture at places adds some uniqueness to the conversation must visit for quick friendly hangout,4,

i love the place bcz i m diehard fan of motorcyclesnice interior nd specially the motorcycles which drives u crazy",4,
awesome place to hangout around the bikers cafe theme and the ambiance is fantastic you can also see luxury cars around food is great with sandwiches and pizzas different varieties of coffee and milkshake are best at it part pricing range is pretty good and affordable,5,
a good place with a grt collection of cars n bikesthe shakes wer not badand the service was quickhowever we end up by watching those automotives,4,
wonderful place to be with friends recommend you to have the caramel mocha tastes wonderful the coffee range is a very good range cannot be compared to starbucks but way better than cafe coffee day,5,
"great place to hangout and chill with friends we just went for a drive around 1230 and ended up here 
the ambience was pretty cool 
we tried garlic bread with brownie and a cold coffee 
brownie was little disappointing i would say too sweet 
though coffee was pretty good 
garlic bread was ok  it could have been little more crisp 
will definately like to try out once more with pizzas and pasta ",3,
"if bikes cars and coffee are your weaknesses then the driven cafe is no less than heaven for you their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous fordmustang5 premium porsche911 carrera4s0 the hulk of bikes triumphrocketiii speedy suzukihayabusa and the kinetic kawasakizx14r which is also one of the world is fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website at present their fleet consists of 150 cars 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles

if this does not satisfy the gearhead inside you then there is some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night

the place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum the ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages it is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff the cafe also has a store which sellsrents biking accessories including biking jackets helmets and other accessories

coming to the food now the first thing we had here was the chili cheese toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo it was quite filling and really tasty next up was the flavourful apple pie with icecream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with icecream

this was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee the selfie coffee has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink this is oneofakind experience you click a selfie and whatsapp that on a number they will print that particular selfie on the coffee

lastly we had the turkish baklava twins which were crunchy nutty flaky and really delicious the place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included colombian coffee death wish illy monka birch coffee araku tribal coffee organic decaf peppermint mocha and many more

the place is definitely a must go

explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long has an american cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 am at least the cheese garlic bread veg puffs and latte coffee were pretty good it is self service and the order came in pretty quick one and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness overall a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite amit agrawal harsh jhunjhunwala poorvi agarwal,3,
"well been to this place for 4 times now the reason being it is unique ambience peace and the opportunity nto spend quality time

would have given it a 5 but the place has lost a bit of it is charm recently

shakes are very good my personal favorite being black currantn the brownie is also super yummy

the main attraction would always be the awesome interiors which this place offers

if u have still not visited this place book your weekend for this",4,
it is ambience is enough to drive you crazy it is one of the best places in financial district to hangout with friends coffee varieties will be satisfactory but will not disappoint too if you want to click an amazing photographs with no one around and want to relax with a cup of coffee it is the place for you,4,
"visited on 3rd june 18 the place is cool and the deserts served here are really nice

i tried the mango pie chocolate donut and the chilli bread and the cold coffee

mango pie was pretty good and the blueberry muffin was really tasty

frappe coffee was an average cold coffee but chilli cheese bread was a different one

the ambiance and the music is cool good place to hangout and get some nice time with friends with a cup of coffee",4,

"have to give it to the driven cafe for the ambience and the branding and the presentation but the quality of food was disappointing
the pesto pasta we ordered was not pesto the mint mocha was not hot and the iced vietnamese was too sweet to stomach",2,

"as part of tasting review ordered masala paneer wrap jumbo chicken wrap and sigbature rice roasted chicken you guys rock well balanced taste  wraps are stuffed with lots of chicken they are juicy and soft signature rice is well cooked packed perfectly served hot and quick delivered
check the packing you will see funny quotations in the wrap boxes they r funny next time dont miss to read them
overall satisfied with the taste and service
will visit the store soon all the best guyskeep going",5,
very bad service waited for 1 hr 30 min but still order was not delivered worst experience with faasos no online tracking system no to fassos ever,1,
"what did i order

i ordered reshmi chicken kebab wrap cheese melt chicken wrap  chicken rice feast

what was good

food arrived on time and was hot
neatly packed
they have used reusable container for the rice and recyclable carton boxsmall for the wraps
attractive packaging

above all the taste the products tasted real good

i feel the cheese  on my mouth when i was having the cheese melt wrap chicken was tender and cooked real soft they are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them wrap was cooked equally good

reshmi chicken kebab wrap was awesome it gave a different taste altogether

highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion it can be had by both  children and elders they have two differential cooked chicken on the top both are boneless and cooked with perfection only the ingredients differ

my tummy is full this noon ",5,
mohsin was really helpful in handling the situation  delivered food on time as promised i really wanted to thank you guys for rectifying my error  resolved my issue in a professional way,5,
worst experience with faasos they accept orders take money and then they do not deliver food it is happening continuously with faasos managed restaurants had a similar experience with their ovenstory pizza as well till now my money of ovenstory pizza order is not refunded i think my money for faasos order is also gone,1,
the place offers amazing rolls if you are a foodie and eat a lot like me then trust me one roll is insufficient for you  order two the mac cheese rolls are scumptious,5,
i ordered from faasos last night but i did not receive my orderwhen i tried to connect with the restaurant they did not respondi tried to connecting with them many times but no one responds and after 2 hrs it shows that order is deliveredeven on next day when zomato tried to call them they did not respondits a wosrt service i have ever get,1,
"i have been constantly ordering faasos

i have become the huge fan of cheese melt chicken wrap

ordered cheese melt chicken wrap with customization of lacha paratha  peri peri cheese

cost around rs 200

damm the taste is top to the world

must recommended",5,
"the egg wrap here is made by unprofessionals the egg wrap is omlette was burnt as hell and i guess they were too lazy to replace it knowing it was burnt and sent me those wraps
 order id 1178102975 on zomato order",1,
"ordered the paneer wraps one with the cheese and other with a tangy masala n a paneer rice bowl too paneer treat to myself the wraps were perfectly made with the covering prepared well and the stuffing was mixed well with the right amount of sauces and cheese giving a juiciness to the wrap the rice bowl was equally yummy with rice being cooked well fragrant with exotic herbs and spices giving a deep ochre n shades of olive green look to the dish overall a nice place to order from n worth the money recommended ",5,
very bad experiencei got incorrect order deliveredi ordered for smoked butter chicken combo under royal indian mean which costs 290but i was delivered smoked butter chicken combo under quick meal which costs 190and it was missing paratha and gulab jamunwhen i called restaurant they did not agree to send me correct order and asked me to contact zomato which i could not get in touch withfinally ended up paying more for what i was delivered and wouldnt recommend to anyone based on my experience,1,
food was good but as compared to price quantity was very less,5,
"wraps here are really yummy as cheap as chole wrap and as expensive as paneer wrap be it any level of the wraps it is yummy
moving on to rice rice feasts are good to go and is very filling too",4,
i have ordered mutton rice in faasos the taste quantity quality was super worse totally disappointed 160rs waste and waiting time was also waste,1,
"food was delivered after 15 hours when the app said it would take half that time faasos does not provide a number of a delivery person the number given is a common number that is always busy hence the order was not possible to track

received an sms soon after placing the order with a tracking link from faasos which did not work",1,
packing is just amazing,5,
"i am usually order mutton over load wrap  but this time it was he will the wrap was not looking like the usual it smells wrong did something went wrong
i do not think i am eating mutton  this is something else entirely",1,
"yummmy food faasos never dissapointed merates also very economicaljust love it  keep going faasosthanks for the yumilicious food and yess the box captions are amazing and packaging to is just awesome loved it  ",5,
"faasos never fails to impress

ordered their chicken cheese melt roll the chicken and the quality of the roll is just top class

 the masala was an added delight too",5,
the melt wrap hardly had cheese even though i ordered extra cheese,1,
wraps pancakes sides order whatever from here and you will not be disappointed my personal favorite is fiery cheesy panner roll the extra masala they provide is an icing on the cake overall experience is good,5,
i had absolutely no hesitation to say thatthis is the worst biryani in d whole universei bet u will throw it in dustbin immediately after 1 spoonfaasos sucks,1,
was super excited to try out the special navratri thali from faasos it had kuttu aata parathas paneer curry sabudana vada and sabudana kheer honestly my excitement dropped down after tasting the parathas as they were too greasy paneer curry on the other hand was the savior vadas were fine and kheer was up to the mark what i liked about the thali was that it had more than enough food for 1 person i am going with 2 stars as the parathas are the base of this thali and i could not finish even half of it i have very high expectations from fassos and am sure they will take this feedback well and improve on the quality of parathas,2,
"navratri special thali was the one i tried this navratri as a food tasting sessioni just loved the food and the thali

it is a must try as it was absolutely filling as well as delicious

it was a satvik thali which means without onion and garlic usedstill had two stuff parathas made of kuttu ka aata paneer ki sabzi sabudana kheer

packing was perfect

highly recommended",4,
"package is good thats the only thing which is good tried jumbo chicken wrapper nd chicken overload jumbo wrap

"fasoos navratri review program
ordered the singhada aloo paratha and panner makhanwala meal
the packaging and the presentation was very nicely done
the singhada aloo parathas were nicely baked and tasted really good the spices in the parathas were less but that is according to my preference
the paneer makhanwala was creamy and tasty it was neither too spicy nor too sweet it had just the right taste and aroma
overall a good experience definitely recommended",4,
"i just love the wraps of faasos and can have them at any time i mainly like their three wraps  cheesy corn salsa wrapmac n cheese wrap and veg pizza wrap all of them are amazing but pizza wrap is just mind blowingthey have multiple options for the bread of the wrap as well  multigrain crispy bakelacha parantha etc

pizza wrap has cheese vegetables and other sauces in it it gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazingthe size is big and is good enough as a meal for one person

i have also tried chola kulcha and veg thali from faasos but in bangalorethey were also very good

i have tried almost all of their major wraps 

pizza wrap 55
mac n cheese wrap 455

food jumbo veg wrap was just perfectly juicy and light crisp from out
jumbo chicken wrap too followed the same
very happy with the food definitely a try",5,
"zomato has asked me to be polite ok faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality when you order a pizza roll they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills they roast it till the end just like how your mumma used to make it and best part comes next faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive it is too much fun to see that status  food is being prepared  your food is in the kitchen and they will not update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say surprise in my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes so fast da then i remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes i asked delivery person why so much late da he said sir we were cooking your roll property that is why it took time open it and try it sir you would have never seen such roll and he was right i never saw the roll only charcoal  attached picture for reference ",1,

i ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast the packaging was good and the order was delivered on time the thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts curd sabudana kheer paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry everything tasted good just that the makhni did not go with the meal there could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased the taste was no doubt best fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together it was a little expensive though but it is worth it unique menus are always welcome

i am unable to attach all the pics though coz i already reviewed the delivery once which somehow got deleted deserves a 45

"since it was the festive season and i wanted to try navratri specials at faasos tried their singhada ke aloo parantha paneer makhanwala sabudhana ki kheer green tomato curry and curd 
it was not as expected did not taste quite well the parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark the kheer was not sweet enough not a big fan of their navratri box
i was disappointed with the food though the food came in nice packaging very neatly packed but taste was not so neat
need to improve a lot",3,
its the festive season and i wanted to try the navrathri thali i tried my hand at faasos the thali was well presented the rotis were a bit hard sweet is average slightly less sweet because of the festival i like the paneer and by the time the raita reached me it was off bitter in taste overall experience neither positive nor negative,3,
"navratrifoodreview


got a chance to review their navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with singhada ke aloo paranthapaneer makhanwalasabudhana ki kheergreen tomato curry and curd best part was paneer makhanwala  it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha  the meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting i rated it 4 because of spilling of oil and tomato which is a bit half cooked else everything was perfectly enroute deli 


enroutedeli",4,
not as expectedover priced for the quantity they are givingnot worthy i ordered it for my husbandhe didnt like it at alldont want to order again,2,
"my actual rating is 35i ordered veg wraps few days back service was quicki must say packaging was really good

i ordered veg cheesy melt paneer wrap and paneer tikka wrap they also served tikha masala with wrapthose who love spicy food must like this masala

cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstandingcheese was busting in mouth with each bitepaneer and gravy was really tastyit has punjabi flavor with cheese combinationloved it

paneer wrap  it was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot taste was not good

my experience was good

follow me on instagram on veganyums for more pics and food fun",3,
"very nice experience with the food from this outlet
i ordered reshmi chicken wrap and it is taste is really good and classic in terms of recipie
quality of packing is too good and i never saw a food packing like this before 
overall its worth tasting in here ",4,
no carry bag was provided,4,
"navratrispecialfoodreviewprogram

i ordered the tomato curry navratri special thali which was really good it had 2 kuttu ata aloo paratha 2 sabudana vadas kheer paneer makhanwala and tomato curry served along with curd the tomato curry was the best of the lot sabudana vada was a little let down as it wasnt cooked completely the parathas were very tasty and it was served hot overall the thali was very tasty and i thoroughly enjoyed everything",4,
one of the worst experience i had with faasos i placed an order for royal chicken rice  the order got accepted and i waited for 2 hours called them  asked zomato support and after make me wait for 2 hours faasos cancelled my order,1,
not the received the food informed me they cant delivered the food as they have many orders really bad customer service,1,
food was good,4,
"hello wraps peeps
i have ordered melt cheese paneer frankie and chicken overload frankie both of them were yummy with the teeka chaska masala that comes along with the packaging
i have received these wraps from faasos as a part of review writing
i rate     for the wraps from this place",4,
so as part of this food tasting festival i was sent a royal navratri meal that had paneer makhanwala singhada aloo paratha hare tamatar ki sabzi and saabudana vada it is an absolute delight for someone who is fasting during navratri each and every dish was just yum even if you are not fasting you should try this slightly overpriced but it is worth trying the paneer and paratha were the best part of the thali,5,
"recently i ordered cheese melt chicken wrap and masala chicken tikka wrap
cheese melt wrap was yum and masala wrap was also nice
in navratri special i tried paneer makhanwala royal navratra meal which was packed nicely",4,
"vegetarian review

i got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review
if you have to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll it had right amount of spices the cheese paneer roll was too bland it had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty

the quantity was good enough for one would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination

however do try the paneer tikka masala roll if you are craving for some snacks",3,
"the food was excellent i had a fast today and this kind was food was awesome  i had a stomach full meal and the experience was really well  thank you fasoos  the paneer was really well and the rotis were very very good ",5,
canceled my online order after 2 hours of waiting no decent response from their side and zomato as a compensation gave 52 credits for a 2 hour long order wait sorry is all they can say,1,
i had ordered the cheesy chicken bhuna wrap and the jumbo chicken wrap from here this was by invitation only and was for tasting the cheesy wrap was great and was filled with cheese in every bite the chicken jumbo wrap actually had loads of chicken with my favorite variety being the chicken meatball this is definitely a must try and is also a part of their signature wraps,4,
the one i ordered chicken wrap would have been 5 star but the amount of salt you added was unbearable do something about it and also the rice dish was fine,3,
ordered jumbo paneer tikka rice fest first of all it was nowhere near to being jumbo simply a small box and they call it jumbo probably they have studied english from some remote island secondly the rice was so damn spicy that i am facing issues in my stomach after having them this was my first and last order from fassos will never ever order again from here,1,
i ordered 2 aloo parathas from faasos and it was so bad that i had to throw both the boxes away the parathas were very oily and they smelt sour as if it was spoilt the taste too was horrible,1,
"one of the best rice combo available with faasos

must try

taste 55
packing 55

comes with one gulabjamun complimentary and
teekha seasoning",4,
how can i say anything good none of my instructions given were followed and when tried to contact they do not reply zomato really needs to work with this restaurant and make sure that special instructions are followed,1,
very bad chicken roll,1,
"very very disappointed
food taste was not up to the mark
it was worst in fact
very bad experience fasoos
should improve quality of food",1,
"ordered two wraps for dinner they filled my appetites quite well i really would appreciate the way packing was done and if your tongue prefers spicy meals you also get an option of spicy masala
jumbo veg wrap  455 was quite delectable it included paneer onion potatoes mashed masala mayonnaise
cheese melt paneer wrap  35 had too much of cheese although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine but in comparison to the one above i expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue

edit
ordered navratra royal meal 55 yesterday  the quality of food was extremely delicious packaging of fasoos has always been appreciable the meal was suffice for two people i look forward to ordering more and more from fasoos i am extremely glad with their service",4,
is bogo offer applied to sell out substandard items in the menu the food was too salty,1,
i hace tried faasos a multiple times i got two wraps through a food review programme the cheesy melt paneer wrap was not cheesy at all the jumbo chicken wrap was good quantity wise but was very spicy,3,
parathas were not up to the mark,3,
wrost food in my life waste of money,1,
"got only 1 roll of my bogo order
disappointed
restaurant contact is unresponsive
opened order in front of delivery boy syed
let is see what they do",1,
"delivery  always on time
great value for money
taste  consistently good i have tried various rice bowls from menu
packaging  awesome  hygienic",4,
faasos is a good option to address your quick hunger pangs with options like veg and non veg wraps and various other indian delicacies the taste will never disappoint you their tea is also my personal favouritetheir meat ball wraps and chicken tikka wraps are truly delicious ample amount of stuffing to make your tummy full must order if you want something quick and not so heavy on your pocket,4,
"my friends and i order wraps from here all the time consistent quality and good delivery the packaging is always great

i recommend the tea and the jumbo rice bowls",4,
"zomato food review program
i have ordered for cheesy chicken buna wrap and
double cheese meat ball wrap the quantity was good enough loved the meat ball wrap food was not hot by the time it was delivered",3,
"tea as always was good  packaging can be better  and sad  it is late by 15 mins

waited for tea for an hour ",4,
the museli was sour pathetic food,1,
i have received one gulab jamun only wherever i ordered for 2apart from this food is good,3,
expected a larger piece,4,
biryani quantity is so and not at all good it is like average better to make it good,1,
very good boy,5,
highly overpriced,3,
no miyo was given,2,
really small portions and avg tatse there are tons of places much better,2,
the wraps are good but over priced the addons are also expensive i had to pay around rs20 to add fiery sauce to the wrap i ordered any wrap beyond rs100 is over priced for me the rice bowls are decently priced and the taste is okay but can be better,3,
paratha was very oily,3,
veg wraps are amezing tasty,5,
small quality but tasty,3,
very nice service,5,
"first things first faasos have always been the first name that comes to mind when it comes to huge sized appetite fulfilling wraps
i have not come across any other place which delivers these kind of huge juicy warps with this amount of filling

tried their cheesy chicken jumbo wrap and chicken jumbo wrap and believe me you will be full to your throat with just one wrap besides the quantity they also maintain quality with the wraps being flavourful and cheesy 

overall if you are looking for no salad only chicken wraps which are my kind of things faasos will not disappoint you for sure",4,
ordered pizza wrap with offer bogo seemed like they splited one wrap into two no sauces were added never had this bad experience with fasoos before surely there quality has degraded one suggestion for fasoos  if you can not afford to provide offers to your customers please do not stop fooling your customers,1,
"the wraps were so good i had the jumbo chicken wrap and cheesey chicken delight
i personally recommend the jumbo chicken wrap as the sauce is will be less
and if you love having the wraps bit juicy then go for the cheesey chicken delight",4,
food quality was good very overpriced,3,
they confirmed and then changed the menu at the last second,1,
not value for money at all less quantity for very much price,2,
best delivery received through malleshthanks mallesh such a great work in time delivery,5,
"firstly thanks to faasos for complimenting the food i ordered their packing were good and the quality of food was also great the amount of chicken filled in the that eas huge where i couldnot eat one whole wrap

i was a great fan of kathi rolls but seldom you get proper authentic kolkata style after me moving to hyderabad from chennai i really missed this part of a review prog got to know about this faasos and decided to order jumbo chicken wrap and cheesy chicken delight

1st one is ok but not great size is huge and can give a try
2nd one is a real delight and name is justified loved their seasonings and quality of wrap  almost matches to kathi roll",4,
"i wish faasos would reconsider their prices 150 bucks for an omlette and some meat

i wouldnt say that your food is not tasty but your outrageous prices are driving me away

 sincerely
someone who would like to enjoy your sausage roll once again without having to take another loan",2,

"worst chicken biryani ever had in hyderabad till now

the food was far more spicy than what was mentioned in the instructions for the restaurant it was ordered for a person having mouth ulcers and he is on his way to hospital due to restaurant negligence worst service by the restaurant,1,
i placed an order for special chicken biryani the taste and the presentation of food is good the chicken pieces are so delicious and the rice is so good,4,

i had ordered briyani combo in the midnight and it was extremely spicy and had stomach upset entire day please do not prefer this restaurant if you are not spice lover,1,
i ordered boneless chicken biryani and food was not at all hot and it smelled like it was cooked long back worst experience not going to order again from this restaurant,1,

ordered chicken dum and received at fine time even though ordered at very late night tastes smooth and not at all spicy which is good for non spicy lovers and ofcourse chicken too cooked well can order when u feel for dum,4,
the rice was not at all tasting like biryani and it is very cold,2,
i have ordered food from the restaurant in the late nightthey have the best biryani specially boneless chicken biryanimutton keema biryani and kaju biryani are worth to try forthey have a wide spread of biryani still looking forward to try some more,4,
"since my childhood i have always been a fan of gongura with non veg and when i got to know that this place serves a good gongura biryani thought of having it

and then comes a day when i finally ordered it and guess what as soon as you see it you will fall in love with the colour of biryani  hopefully that is not an artificial colour but coming to taste it is awesome just lyk god is omnipotent the flavour of gongura is omnipresent i mean in every rice grain you can sense it the chicken pieces too were very good they are soft too as one my friends who has a fence to her teeth could eat those easily 
tagged at a moderate price  quantity is quite sufficient

if you are a lover of gongura  then this a must try

note i do not have any idea about ambience  my rating confined to gongura biryani alone as i have not had anything else from there

ps i still have this doubt how the chef managed to get that color to the biryani ",4,
"i ordered ulavacharu chicken biryani spicy fried chicken chicken fried piece biryani excellent taste and good quality and quick delivery ",5,
"not so spicy but totally lip smaking

i was not sure whether i should order from this place or not with a semi doubt went ahead and ordered fish biryani and curd rice with coke and i must say it was a good decision i made the biryani was so good with nice quantity of fish 65 the curd was so creamy and good that i will surely order again from here",4,
i have ordered egg biryani from this restaurant taste wise not that much superbbut quantity wise it was more i will give 35 for taste but online order came very early i can appreciate for restaurant fast service,3,
ordered veg manchuria at midnight and it was totally upto our expectationsvery tasty food and packed nicely would recommend everyone to try out the manchurian either by ordering or personally visiting the place,5,
not so goodfood is averagequality is not so goodonly packing seems to be good but not the foodi think its waste of time to visit,1,
have ordered ulavacharu biriyani its very tasty and we liked it any new buddy just try it once and you will love it tasty loved resonableprice,5,
i did not try too many things from here but chicken dum biryani was good quantity was very good if you are a single person then it is too much and for two people it is not very enough you would need to get a shake or something with it it is not like you will be hungry but you will not be full till neckthat is how i like eating biryani if two persons are just normal eater then it is a winwin,4,
i loved the biryani very good taste great quality  if you are looking for variety of biryani try this place you will find great range variety,5,

great food i love the ulvacharu biryani from here ambience is alright but could be bettertaste wiseawesome but most importantly prices are very competetive which makes it affordable,5,

excellent service,5,
i found some of the dishes especially curries very unique and tasty and the options in biryanis they provide makes them my favourite dinner place,5,
it is not like what i order,1,
did not reach expectationsworst taste thrown into dustbin,1,
nestled between the hustle bustle of gachibowli is a small cafe ombc one of the very few places in the city with amazing cookies and bagels having visited the cafe a handful of times some of our favourites include the everything bagel chocochip cookies margherita pizza and the banana cake although the staff is sweet and accommodating the service is a little slow at times sometimes we have received our pizzas before the muffins we highly recommend this place this place is perfect for an outing with friends or even for work meetings and offers a wide range of choice from savoury to sweets one of our favourites in the city,4,
one of the best places to fill your stomach with this place is a treat in case you are a sweet tooth the food is quite good but can never be compared to the sweet delicacies the tuna sandwich is a win if you like sea food there are shakes here too which are not up to the mark comparitively,4,
absolutely pathetic i placed an order for half kg mocha walnut cake the order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp when i called the next day to collect the cake they could not find my order i had to call multiple times and finally i was told my order is ready upon reaching the outlet the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me when i asked them if this is really mocha walnut they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake they even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much i have already paid upon reaching home when the cake was cut we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch the outlet cheated me and so i called them and blasted over phone i reached the outlet at 1030 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back i was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a bday cake the store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them never ever going back and i strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk i will for sure completely avoid this place,1,
went to this place for lunch ordered and paid waited for 25 minutes and realise that order has not been placed the place had more people serving than the people eating and yet this happened and everyone was blaming everyone else there were flies all over the place poor show had to skip lunch because of their error,1,
zomato information is wrong it says the place closes at 11 we reached at 1030 and the place was closed the staff was quite uncourteous and turned is it quite impolitely,1,
have heard good things about this place so wanted to give a try went in and sat no one even approached us ordered a chicken omelette mushroom omelette and filter coffee the food was decent but the service needs to improve had some mosquitoes the tables were not cleaned promptly after the guests left the same guy who was cleaning the tables brought us coffee bare hands wish he would wear gloves hope the administration takes notice,2,
"oh what a lovely place thanks to my friend who took me here for breakfast both of us were super hungry we ordered mushroom omelette with butter crossiant and scarmbled egg with butter crossiant a jalepeno bagel with cream chees omg  what amazing they tasted the best crossiant i have come across so far in india so soft so were the scrambles egg and mushroom omlette the cream cheese was just amazing we ordered hazelnut cafe mocha and hazelnut capcuinno they were just good thank go hazelnut syrup they used wasnt very sweet
i was so in love with smell of bread they are baking took banana cake  danish pastry  chocolate cake and brioche for my frined would definitely recommend if you love bread that too freshly baked ",5,
been here with my friends good place for meeting food is nice service is slow while ordering food they can improve the outside restaurant because when i went ac was not working inside is very cool and  do your official work with full concentration but its bit noisy due to machines inside they can think about reducing the noise,4,
"just your normal cafe nothing out of the ordinary

very slow and inattentive service okay food coffee not that great

the only thing i would think of ordering on repeat would be the spinach and mushroom pie and maybe the blueberry danish

value for money could be better

not at all inpressive ",3,
a quiet and comfortable place for hanging out with friends their food is not that great but the service is good we ordered simple dishes like garlic bread pasta and bagel but everything seemed a bit dry i was expecting a lot more from this place as it said they freshly bake all the bread items,3,
"this bakery is present in a prime location
the ambience and seating are great
but the food lacks in taste
i tried blueberry cake and  mushroom makhni  sandwich here neither of which was upto the mark
still it is a great place to hangout with friends",4,
i really like this place it has an old world charm the bakery products are up to the mark and i would recommend their victorian cream cake with raspberries i love tea cakes and throughly enjoyed it it also has really nice cold coffee and soup,4,
"wonderful cream cheese bagels

prompt delivery good quantity and great taste the bagels are very nicely toasted and had a very generous amount of cream cheese on them

55",5,
went there on saturday evening simple and busy place tried a cake with blueberry and cheese portion is huge tasted very good all of us liked it also had the grilled chicken sandwich with ginger pickle that ginger taste was good overall good place to have some cakes and snacks,4,
"this place is located opposite to deloitte towers with the limited seating you will find it mostly over crowded the ambiance has a vintage feel as soon as you enter
i ordered paneer chilli pizza peach iced teachilly cheese tpast and pink sauce pastaall of them were okayish
pizza was perfect indian pizza tasted like panner chilly gravy on pizza base and pasta also had a very desi taste to it they put carrots in pasta which did not go well at alli only like the chilly cheese toast which were toasted to perfection

ambiance35",3,
"limited menu but whatever is there is great
usually crowded takes some time to get the food to you
only for coffee 5 stars
ambience goodinside and outdoor seating available",4,
"this place is amazing

i happen to have come across this bakery through few of my friends and i was blown away with the things they had to offer

to begin with  i tried their the most famous banana cake and the cookiestrust mei have never ever had such a yummy banana cake

it is a must try thing here and so are the cookiesi tried dark chocolate cookies and choco chip cookiesthe filling was perfect and so was the taste

the staff was very nice and welcoming

this place is highly recommended

i can not wait to try their other stuff like pizza and all",5,
"taste is good  best things to order  banana bread  i can eat it whole day super yum muffins pesto pasta carrot cake

the outdoor seating was a disappointment for lunch and yes service little slow",4,
they sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good the must try items are brownies chocochip cookies banana bread sandwiches pizza etc they sever few items which do not really have any purpose but just to attract kidseg nutella brioche these kind of items might dissatisfy people,4,
a woody ambience gives you that vintage feel the place is mostly crowded due to the limited seating the food here is delicious and freshly baked we tried the danish custard and croissant both were too good my personal favourite is the former the prices are a bit high but considering the taste and quality i think they are a bit fairly priced overall a good place to try something fresh out of the oven,4,
being a pizza fan i love to try a lot of pizzas and this was one of the best in town the crust was perfectly baked and hit the right perfection of crust thickness for me by not being too crisp  thin the margherita with double cheese was so yummy,5,
"craving for pizza in morning

the old madras baking company to the rescue

thin crust crispy at the end and delicious

ordered spinach peppers roasted onions feta pizza

they took care of my comments as requested

will surely try other toppings soon

thank you

would loved if it would hve a little more peppers in it",4,
spent good time with family ordered a few things tomato basil soup chicken sandwich madras filter coffee mushroom soup chocolate pastry and chilli cheese toast everything was just perfect good ambience slightly short on options hence 45,4,
"the best place for cakes n baking foodthe best breads and super thin and delicious cheeze pizzas pastas are available here do not miss the old style dark chocolate cake ",5,
"i went very late to this place maybe post dinner time so the kitchen was almost closed i ordered double cheese margherita pizza one cheese and chilli toast and a hot chocolate and the best was hot chocolate it tasted like heaven on earth it was the best the next would be cheese and chilli toast very cheesy and yunm pizza was normal authentic italian quite bland but really good obviously thin crust and the ambience was not great but pretty good cute setting they have an outside dine area too
overal 45",4,
"the place is located amongst the chaos of companies and residents
it has a nice setup to sit and relax
they serve one of the best white sauce pasta hot and creamy it is a perfect thing to have we ordered pizza also
it was better than average though but can be tried 
and also they have good variety of cakes which are worth trying
a must visit place",4,
"bagels  is what i have most loved here and the pasta is great as always the staff is friendly and quick overall it is a bit expensive but if you have some free time to spenddo visit this place ",4,
visited this highly rated place yesterday ordered a sandwich brownie and paneer puff everything was very average not likely to try again,2,
we had the pesto pasta paneer tikka pizza a mocha and took a loaf of bread home everything we had was quite good except the pizza which was lacking some flavor the bread is amongst the best we have had so far the ambiance was good even though it gets a bit busy outside we will busy again soon,4,
"a fine place to sit and relax on a lazy afternoon
food is okayish but on the expensive side
but the cakes and pastries are not recommended",3,
a nice place in a great location friendly staff and tasty food the chocolate croissant was yummmm we ordered a sandwich which had ginger pickle in it pretty interesting parking issues and limited indoor seating when its too hot to grab a seat outside,3,
"this place has decent breakfast options but the omlettes are just ordinary with not much u can praise about and yeah it comes with one bread piece one not two one

filter coffee was decent though bitter

you will get better omlettes anywhere elsethis is hyped",2,
this is my all the time go to place it is very nearby to deloitte towers deloitte g and h block ramky towers babukhan lane try their filter coffee and brownie they have the best brownie i ever had also try their other cakes and puffs they also provide fresh breads they both have indoor and outdoor sitting arrangement service is very good,5,
i personally liked the bagel with cheese and capuccino there was some renovation work happening outdoors when we visited this place we were disturbed by the noise and hence could not stay longer good for groups,3,
we tried the oregano beagle with cheese and it was heavenly there also tried the all season olives and oregano breads they were little ok ok overall the place has a good seating area but the price is high considering the potion and taste,3,
good food and ambience loved the beach tables chairs at the non ac area hygienic too gr8 place to spend times with lots of conversations with awesome coffee,4,
undoubtedly one of the best bakeries in hyd  i tried the banana cake  carrot cake  choco chips cake chocolate muffin  love all of them  the cakes are always baked properly recommending this place for pound cake lovers,5,
"the brekkies are served with some lovely soft croissants
the eggs were decent too

pretty good place for breakfast delivery considering it opens early",3,
"beautiful set up with inside seating as well as alfresco review is for a take away of banana bread carrot cake couple of varieties of bagels and whole wheat bread everything is made fresh without any preservatives they cut the bread right in front of you coming to packing they do not use plastic at all except to pack bread banana bread was amazing carrot cake was also good
packing 55taste 55quantity 45value for money 45

overall experience 55",5,
"i am from chennai and a big fan for old madras baking company have ordered from this place for few times

taste is awesome no complaints what so ever it is fresh and tastes good only concern is the way the delivery person handles the food

last time the pizza arrived cold completely cold today pizza came dismantled it was brought upside down by the delivery person

one suggestion to management pls instruct the delivery team to handle the food with more care and respect otherwise you will lose your customers see the photos and know it yourself",4,
staying in ramky towers we frequent this place quite often although little did we know how incredibly disrespectful the staff really is we found a hair in an ice cube inside the iced tea when informed the staff on the counter about it  they willingly accepted it without checking 10 minutes later one of the staff folks comes back saying  are you sure there is a hair  only to find out they had removed the ice cube which had the hair after quite a discussion they brought the executive chef  who literally just stood there with absolutely no contribution to the discussion eventually when one of the staff is members nandu in the photo asserted that he will personally pay for it we asked for the owner is contact who then waived off the bill all in all sincerely disappointed with the attitude of the staff,1,
this is probably the only place in hyderabad serving bagels and they taste really good a little further away from the city but good bagels are worth the drive,5,
small place near meenakshi and opp deloitte building courteous staff and good food they have outside seating as well which is decent overall a decent place,3,
they got some good baked items like bread bagels and puff pastries etc other menu items were also decent do not order their feta cheese omellete it is too salty the chef should know better service can be improved,3,
amazing food a really good variety of muffins in the menu my favourite is the blueberry muffin which one should definitely try goes light on the pockets as well must visit if you want to just talk and spend some quality time with your friends right opposite deloitte in gachibowli makes it easily accessible as well will definitely visit again,5,
i always visit this place when i want to buy a good bread they have good variety not as pricy and tastes amazing today i tried their all in bagel and americano both are recommended all in bagel is one of the best i have ever tried must visit place for all bread lovers,5,
tried their cold coffee chilly cheese toast and bagel with cream cheese the cheese toast and bagel were very good the cream cheese was also great the cold coffee was decent would have rated 4 but the service was disappointing i asked for water twice but the staff did not seem to care,3,
"beautiful and classy set up of a bakery with real essence of baking ingrained

loved the old school charm and new age tech enablement
this place is a bliss for bread lovers
called for chicken sandwich and masala omelette along with filter coffee
filter coffee was just about perfect
masala omelette was good
breads of the sandwich were fresh and crisp
loved it",4,
i paid additional amount to add chiken to the pasta but the pasta that came had nothing,3,
"i was here at this place for lunch with my colleague this place is quite popular among people working at deloitte meenakshi gachibowli though it is small place
we had a chicken makhani pizza the pizza was very good and it was made with thin crest the ambience was also good the bakery products in display also seemed to be fresh and delicious though could not taste them pricing wise it is a bit on the higher side i felt
overall it was a good experience here at this place and i would rate this as
food  45
ambience  455
service  45",4,
we ordered a double margherita pizza and white sauce pasta the texture of white sauce was off and it was very clumpy the pasta was still very hot the pizza was fine taste wise but it can not be called a margherita pizza had few strands of shredded basil that was dry all the sachets of oregano seasoning expired 3 months ago in june and when we opened the sachets there were a lot of clumps it is okay not to give any seasoning if you do not have it but sending expired stuff is completely unacceptable the delivery and packing was good wish they had paid same attention to the food,2,
"one of the nicer places in hyderabad whether it is for an evening cup of coffee or breakfast

quality  taste of beverages  food is good
best part is their bakes breads bagels  other products

a bit on the expensive side as compared to other similar coffee places should do something about the indoor seating arrangement",4,
"another random but pleasant pick from zomato for breakfast good place for bakery food

dishes tried breakfast with a butter croissant and chicken omelette

ambiance pretty impressive and must try for breakfast lovers interiors are beautiful

service needs a bit improvement in terms of the outside sitting",4,
"ordered red sauce veg pasta got it delivered at friends house and the taste was not that great average and the richness in the pasta was lagging 

i felt it could have been better with the gravy and sauce a lil thick it was a but watery 

heard a lot from this place a bit disappointed  hoping to get to order again and hopefully it will be better",3,
"ignored this restaurant for almost a year thinking that it would be a regular bakery but now i regret
they make amazing pizzas and so many authentic cakes ambiance is cool good place to hang out with friends and colleagues

must try  smoked pizza banana cake carrot cake freshly baked breads
do not miss the filter coffee",4,
visited this place yesterdayambience is quite good ordered hazelnut coffeepeach iced tea red sauce pasta and paneer pizza coffee was totally amazingpizza was freshly baked and tasted very goodpasta was average only overall a good place to hangout with friends,4,
"this place has freshly baked stuff probably the best you would find in this locality but the beverages are just about average

the danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since i am quite frequent here all cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli is the mushroom spinach puff is good special omlette did not really match my expectations here for the main course i have tried tuna melt sandwich egg salad sandwich double cheese margherita pizza smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good so all my points go for the food here

capuccino latte or filter coffee for that matter did not really please me even the peach iced tea was not that great

pretty ambience good food and not that great drinks",4,
"my absolute goto place this place is a blessing for me since it serves amazing coffee also absolutely near to my office so i can hop in whenever i want
ambience love it not too fancy not too boring just about right 
food and coffee looooveee it everything you eat there is absolutely fresh i just love the donuts sandwiches and the coffee i have tried almost everything on their menu and i guarantee that nothing will disappoint you
must try egg salad sandwich in focaccia bread  any coffee and the nutella brioche
price affordable with a guaranteed smile when you leave
service amazing staff",5,
"the old madras baking company how posh does it sound and what a spectacular ambience this place is a must try for breakfast lovers 

they have really amazing bread rolls and bakery items available for purchase i have tried their garlic bread the english bread their croissants chocolate muffins custard and chocolate danish brownies all worth it

over breakfast i tried the triple cheese sandwich found it quite average the white sauce pasta was delicious though i have also tried the mushroom sandwich with other veggies super amazing

although the price point is probably a little on the higher side it is worth a try",4,
"whenever i crave to have a good cup of coffee this is the place i want to head to

their madras coffee is soothing refreshing and amazing
i tried their cappuccino but i will go back to have the madras coffee again probably

they bake their own breads so the sandwiches are a must try
we ordered grilled chicken sandwich and egg sandwich with focaccia bread and trust me they were mouth watering the stuffing was adequate and it had the perfect crunch

also i will vouch for their grilled chicken salad it is loaded with chicken and veggies and are so filling

they also have counter with freshly baked cakes muffins breads and cookies

so though the menu is not that elaborate but whatever they are offering it is quite good
price wise its ok with the quality and the quantity of the stuff they are providing
they have both indoor and outdoor seating areaso do choose according to the weather outside
though the service is bit slow you can relax by sipping a cup of coffeechatting away or reading a book in cafe right",4,
i did not give a 5 because i felt everything is a bit costly herebut the bagel and cream cheese is a must tryit is deliciousbagel costed 50 bucks plus cream another 50,4,
"loved the bakery they have bunch of bakery items to try along with pasta  pizza  sandwiches and soups

ambience and delivery time is just apt for an evening hangout place
things to try for sure  carrot cake  victoria cake  bagel and cream cheese",4,
the croissants served with scrambled eggs is an awesome start for the day the scream led eggs are really nice soft and delicious but i was disappointed by the special omelette which is costlier than the scrambled eggs but not tastes better than that i tried scrambled eggs  omelette and special omelette i must say that scrambled eggs are my favourite,3,
"egg salad and cappuccino were good
chilli garlic cheese toast could have more of cheese and spice added to it
brownie shake required a lot of improvements
not that great place",2,
"visited this cafe on sunday evening and was a little disappointed to see hardly any baked item available on display so we stuck to their menu
we had ordered hot chocolate apple iced tea chicken melt sandwich and fizzy lemonade
service is very quick and all the items freshly prepared and served in a jiffy
the place is tad bit pricy but worth it",4,
very pathetic service 37 mins and still waiting for a cup of coffee if you are a coffee shop and you can not provide a cup of coffee in 10 mins you should shut down,1,
"your bagels reminded me of new york need i say more
never thought i would find that authentic jewish taste outside of israel and big apple ever so a big thank you ",5,
worst horrible,1,
especially when you thought that this place was closed down the surprise when you find it to be open and running as efficiently and beautiful years before you immediately want to enjoy the food and so i did it was extremely delicious and lip smacking and i also recommended 20 of my friends to visit there i hope this restaurant gets more business i would like to give this place four stars,3,
"great breads been buying regularly and the consistency is amazing in the breads
my only gripe  wish the dark chocolate cookie was equally consistent on some days it is great but feels stale on other days
fantastic place nonetheless",5,
ordered for egg white omlette but got regular omlette,1,
"i bought an assortment of bakery products from here but i have to say i have had far superior before the pastry was alright the cookie was too moist the banana cake was good and the croissants were soggy

overall just a one time visit",3,
"we had gone to old madras baking company in the past for buying bread but never sat down and had a meal there we were out on a saturday morning to check out a house right opposite this place it was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here the place is very chilled out there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty

my husband placed the order for usa mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him i am usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind we ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese the bagel was amazing with the coffee i am not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it we made a pact to go for breakfast every saturday mornings after this because i realised what an important meal i was missing due to my laziness 

would recommend this place to everyone for sure i for sure am going back again for the bagels and coffee",5,
it is a nice cozy cafe and has a pleasant ambience i tried the red velvet pastry here decent enough i would say coffees at the place are also worth a try,4,
filter coffee croissant cravings get satiated here it hums with a beat synced with mine tasting one at a time to control calories they have got a wide array of goodies custard bun banana cake danish etc etc variety of cheese preserves pickles if they can get their over the door air blowers to keep the flies away i would have given 5,4,
taste was good but the croissant became moist because it was packed along with omlette please ensure appropriate packing,4,
it is a calm place to have breakfast at they open as early as 7am in the morning you can see them bake fresh bread everything is fresh here the coffee is amazing here a go to place for a nice start,5,
the edd did not have any taste the croissant was not crispy instead of packing both in one big box you can use 2 small ones so that the croissant remains crispy total waste of money for this order,1,
the the chicken on the sandwich was stale and inedible  highly unprofessional from a restaurant like yours i want my money refunded,1,
"the old madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor

the coffee is quite good with a lot of variations available the best part is the freshly baked breads those beautiful soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter even the puffs and victoria cake are nice to have

coming to the worst part  the service in all my visits over the past couple of months this has been the biggest turn off about this place almost always i had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating more often than not you can see flies buzzing over the tables though the kitchen looks quite hygienic",3,
"go for filter coffee and sandwich especially during monsoon 
prices are not too high and they also have variety of bakery items to choose from as well",4,
"breakfast the old madras baking company is really something people should be aware aboutthe ambience and the service would make your soul and heart happy 
starting with veg white pasta and ending with a good cup of cold coffeewhat else do u need to pamper yourself on weekends ",4,
food not as order,2,
hidden away in gachibowli lies this amazing bakery the chocolate cake is to kill for the pastry and the bread are super soft and melts in the mouth apple muffin chicken pot pie nutella doughnut chocolate babka are some of my favorites if here do not miss out on the chocolate cake ps you get the best coffee too,5,
simply wow what a taste concept ambience service they did everything perfect my favourite place to go when i am at office and crave for some food after this i really want to visit chennai once,5,
"this place is located near the hdfc bank inside the meenakshi bamboos commercial complex in the gachibowli area i went there along with a friend as i read great reviews about their doughnuts and cakes

my first impression about this place was that it had a nice decor and relaxed seating areas both indoor and outdoor we went there around 1 pm and it was very hot so we opted for sitting indoor

we tried many cakes cookies and doughnuts here and i liked most of them but my favorite are

a red velvet doughnut rs60 which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling

b salted nutella doughnut rs75 which was very soft and stuffed with nutella

c banana cake rs155 which was moist soft and cake like sweet bread

d dark chocolate cookie rs50 which was once again very soft but was not too sweet

epicureantalescom",4,
the restaurant is good food is good ambience of the outdoor seating area is average they really need to improve on the service front it took the restaurant more than half an hour to prepare a coffee and a sandwich there were no menus in the seating area the setup is semi self service you have to go to the counter to give the order but they will serve you at your seat,3,
stale pizza,1,
i have been here twice and both the times for breakfast and i must say i love what they cook their bakery is fresh and a pure delight size of sandwiches is huge omelettes are interesting and tasty,4,
"i tried this places called old madras baking company and was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and quality of food ordered a mushroom sandwich which came in brown bread with a pinch of basil and tomato sauce the filling had bell peppers and there was no extra grease which was the best part

they bake fresh bread everyday and each of their items look so good there is a variety of options like bagels custard buns brownies and croissants i also tried their multi grain bread which has flax seeds millets and other healthy seeds it was totally yummy

worth the price you pay for and for conscious eaters there is always an option here they will customise food for you",5,
i ate so much like sooo much because the food is yum the interiors are good i however sat outside and it was beautiful and peaceful the service is good staff is courteous had the best bagel ever excellent experience,5,
this is an amazing place to hang out with your friends for a coffee their breads are amazing as they bake fresh everyday i have a big craving for their spinach corn and cheese toast and also for their cinnamon bomb their donuts are really good specially the salted nuttela and the elvis donuts do not ever miss their chennai filter coffee over all a great place and very customer friendly just a small let down compared to their chennai outlets they lack few items hopefully they get back the way how it is in chennai a must go place in hyderabad,4,
"though i had very less variety of food here i am quite impressed with their quality and taste really appreciate the ambience pretty clean place their speciality is breads try their bread for sure garlic bread is awesome here
very detailed menu and professional to core they stick to basics and do not try to satisfy every cuisine",4,
i love this place so much that i forget clicking any pictures everytime i go there spinach feta cheese omelette plain bagel with cream cheese antipesti pesto sandwich and chicken sausage roll are some must haves cakes are a bit too bready if that is a word,5,
one definitely have to try their coconut bun and cream cheese bagels bread loafs are so fresh here and we can get variety of cheese super place to hangout,5,
i liked the ambience the wooden tables looked great and i was able to take some beautiful snaps the service was prompt i ordered victoria cake red velvet brownie and chocolate croissant the victoria cake had a layer of cream and blueberry sauce sandwiched between two slices of sponge cake it tasted delicious in the croissant the chocolate reminded me of cadbury diary milk and red velvet brownie was good too,4,
"good place for bakery food mutligrain cereal bread tasted good and desserts are awesome had red velvet donut and apple muffinthe cakes are little over priced but you can get for what you have paid for ",4,
visited this place on a hot sultry morning ordered a red sauce pasta and a veg feta pizza both the dishes tasted good timely service and a good place to hangout and chill will surely visit this place if i visit hyderabad again,4,
"great place it is right next to my colony so it is super convenient in case i am craving a croissant in the morning or want a lemonade after school great place to meet people and chill the pasteries are great the four cheese pizza is amendabe and the alfredo pasta is amazing they have a wide range of milkshakes as well also they allow you to bring your dog and sit outside so props the indoor seating is kind of too bright and uncomfortable but the outdoors smells like smoke and has many mosquitos so seating is kind of a dread when i go there but food and service definitely makes up for it ",4,
i liked the ambience and lighting however their food quality needs lot of improvement especially sizzlers they made good lasgna but they had no idea at all about how sizzler is made also their services are little slow,1,
"i was searching for a good veg place around gachibowli to host my daughters 1st bday and ended up with lime dinesh was the manager and he made sure the menu and other arrangements are all taken care off over all i was happy with the way it went except for few points to caution 

my personal fav foods  
 welcome drink  pan shots
 starters  yum banana tikki
 gravys  malai kofta
 noodles
 mango dal
 chats and chocolate gulabjamun
what is good 
 food is great in contrast to what we generally see in party places where the hall is free
 staff is friendly
 their roof top gives a different experience than a regular ac hall

things to keep in mind 
 the mic system caused issues which spoiled the party mood they have good mic system please make sure its in working condition and there is av operator in stand by through out the party
 this place is strictly for a small group statis crowd should not exceed 60  65 pax you can enjoy the place to fullest with 5060 pax
 since it is roof top summers can be pain ful even with coolers there is always this tension of rain p

with the above exceptions i loved the place their suite rooms are one of the best in the area at a reasonable price their ala carte menu also serves the best veg food in this part of the city",4,
really do not go with rating we had here in the evening and trust me food was not at all good and coming to service they are damn slow 90 items in the menu are unavailable only available items will be served 40mins later your order even people were very few when we visited here waste of money and time,1,
"you need at least 2 hrs time to get your food prepare better go for other restaurant instead of ordering food from it
i have ordered food from it and they either cancel or take 2 hr to just prepare your food",2,
sizzlers are smoking hot here staff are really friendly help u in choosing a dish when in turmoil although it took time for them to serve the dish was worth the wait,5,
"this hotel has both accommodation and hotel downstairsi was for 3days in this hotel the hospitality was good and suiets are costing around 3k per dayin the room they have provided all the things 247 hot water facilityall the decorative pieces are good here and beautiful ambiencei ate shezwan fried rice it is good here and spicy it is costing around 225we ate veg biryani garlic naan and panner tikka masala curry they are very good to tasteif you stay in this hotel breakfast is complimentarythey have provided many bf items which i could not able to those manycoming to the breakfast in break they have provided both english and indian breakfastthey gave milk and cornflakes idli dosa and upma

overall ambience 55

one more thing this place is only for vegans not for non vegetarians",5,
i booked the lime for catering for a private occasion for a gathering for around 80 guests to start with they are very professional in getting the arrangements clear to customer and provide all necessary details about the services to be provided on event day on event day they were sharp on time and had all things well set before guests started coming in starters and welcome drinks were floated to the guests nicely the main course and desserts were also pretty delicious overall i was extremely impressed and satisfied with the services and highly recommend it for any events,5,

thanks so much squeeze squeeze at the lime",5,
"one among the good pure vegetarian restaurants ambiance is average
food is good quality wise however i have been there multiple times and have observed a deterioration in the service earlier they used to being finger bowl on the table sauf in the end  even have sometimes offered some complimentary chocolates for trial now despite of asking multiple times for finger bowl they did not gave a damn about it",4,

"food packaging is too good ingredients in the food were totally good i have given it 4star because it worth the price 
taste is somewhat little less but otherwise its good
only in just 129 rs you can eat the great appetizing meal ",4,
we used catering service from squeeze  the lime for our kid is birthday at our community premises we received compliments on food from most of our guests the service was good and there was issue even when our guest count was more than what we estimated we have chosen squeeze  the lime for our kid is bday party as we found it very good when we attended few parties at roof top banquet it is the best place if you are planning to have a party with around 90100 guests i look forward for another event with squeeze  the lime,4,

nice place good food with lot of jain options fresh ingredients and preparation lemon corriander soup paneer pasanda pasta noodles were good presentation and serving are also upto the mark needs improvement in food delivery wait time,5,
the quality of the food is bad the noodles starter and the sweet everything was drenched in heavy oil the taste itself shows that the oil used is also of low quality rather than spending on the packaging of the food they could have spent some money on providing health food,1,
have been twice to this place one of the rare places in hyderabad where you can have good vegetarian food ambiance is also good some of the starters have good representation,4,
"real value for money
one of the best places for vegetaraian buffet in and around hitech city

would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff they were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own what more i could have asked for at the end special thanks to lime manager dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had i would strongly recommend this place if you want a memory for a very long time",5,
this place is easily one of the best exclusive vegetarian restaurants in hyderabad their food menu is exhaustive includes all cuisines from south indian italian orient thai and our favourite north indian and the best part is all of them are mouth wateringdelicious the staff is very friendly and the service is impeccable the prices are affordable too i was pleasantly surprised when i looked at the prices as the taste and quality was way above what they charge i am gonna visit this place atleast once every fortnight,5,
i have been to squeeze  the lime many times with my family we always enjoy the food here we like the ambience chef mr dinesh is the best,5,
"the food is really nice and quite authentic i have been to this place multiple times during lunch and dinner and this place never disappointed me

be any cuisine they do justice to it whether it is chinese indian or italian everything tastes good it is a must visit for a vegetarian food lover

must try are soups and chinese starters

now the downside the buffet here is ok and cheap not sure why the quality gets degraded in buffet but same tastes good in alacarte",4,
great vegetarian food either you have food at their outlet or order home or go for their catering services for party they serve amazing food food options are decently good and staff is very courteous for a small scale party recently i took their catering services and i must say all my guests and family were delighted with the diverse menu as well as quality of food great job squeeze lime team mr raj mr dinesh thanks for great food and excellent coordination,4,
i have been to this place many times i feel their buffets need to improve i just did not feel it to be upto the mark the a la carte is far better the decor s good with really courteous staff,3,
went for a lunch buffet on a monday and the restaurant was not crowded ambiance was very good starters served were good especially corn and finger potato which was too crispy and yummy with the mayonnaise pizza was average main course included was mushroom fried rice roti with paneer curry pasta noodles and they are all decent all in all for the price299  tax this place gave us good food for the buds,4,
i recently had team lunch here it was a buffet lunch and i got surprised for their price it was 300 on weekdays they have good starter like pizza slices pani and dahi puri banana cutlet and one manchuriya then there is enough item for main course its not much specious place so i would say book a table before visiting over all i found this place good and value for money,4,
"the food packing is very good

but the food taste is very worse

i am very disappointed",1,
"nice ambience for having buffet lunchquick hot and tasty servings
since it is located inside roads no hassle of traffic sound
must try dahi paani poori",4,
chutney was not good in taste rest was good,3,

vada did not getfry inside everything else good,3,
pretty good deal poha was cold and dry rest of food were tasty,4,
so was here like 10 mins back the place is kinda okayish but considering that price range it becomes even more undesirable dessert was probably the best part of the whole course everything else was mediocre at best the atmosphere is lack luster so even that does not help so yeah not the most exciting places to visit,1,
very spicy and vada is uncooked disappointing,2,
i ordered platinum combo and requested him to prepare jain food and the taste was awesomehighly recommended for this restaurant,4,
i have always loved the food here and they never let my tummy down for vegetarians this is one of the best options to have it has a different taste from all and yes hygienic too loved it,5,

food was good and sufficient in quantity,4,
rice is not cooked properly  overall good,3,
must read  i went to this place with my friends for buffet lunch we had two options for welcome drink  one is pineapple and other is grape which were not natural fruit juices they tasted as preservatives then moving on to soup  manchow soup was good waiter forget to give us the starter served us after we reminding him we liked crispy baby corn among 3 varieties of starters which he took 10 mints to serve for the second serve when only 10 of the place was occupied when i asked him mayo dip waiter was giving us the left over part of dip on the table beside when i asked for chilled water they were saying they do not have later one of my friend asked the same person he gave us chilled water all the items which were placed at buffet were cold not even luke warm biryani was totally dried out rice was sticking to the vessel had lot more bad experience here on same day,1,
packing was nice food was good but pineapple was ripped perfectly as well as it was not fresh another thing is i ordered for juice pack and u sent me water bottle,4,

items ordered rashmi kababpaya soupchicken biryanimutton biryani

biryani is okay soup is nice

overall good for one time visit",4,
had the worst service of my life had to wait for more than 2 hours for the main course it was later told that there was some problem with the kitchen they later served food when we were standing outside and waiting for the bill this could be a one off problem but i expected better communication from the staff so that we could have made alternate plans instead of waiting endlessly for 2 hours when they kept telling us that food will come in the next 510mins,1,
"i have been to khaan saab in vijayawada earlier and loved the food and ambience hence chose to go to this place as i wanted to eat some naan and paneer butter masalathe ambience is good and the food is just amazing from starters to main course food was just yum they have got an interesting nawabi sort of menu prices are lightly high and that is fine for me because the taste is worth the money

"i have been to khaan saab couple of days before before i went there i have gone through all the reviews in zomato and i was amazed with those reviewspaid reviews the worse experience i had at khaan saab

cons worse hospitality
non friendly staff
worse food

even i asked for mint chutney they brought some junk from the storage and made some garbage chutney i have paid 2000 for 3 dishesits totally worthless and damn paid reviews

i am suggesting you to dnt take your office collegues and higher officials",1,
worst experience especially at gachibowli branchno proper management food was not cooked properly food quality was worst and quantity was less and prices were huge,1,
"khaan saab in gachibowli was known for it is ambience and interesting kebab menu

we ordered murgh sheek kabab and chicken tikka biryani kebab starter was good with minced chicken kebab chicken tikka biryani was chefs special here and rightly mentioned biryani was undoubtedly one of the best in the city it was served with 6 medium sized boneless tikka pieces smoky grilled and raitha simply loved the spice flavors in biryani

al 388 bucks after zomato gold discount",4,
they charge premium for the food and serve stale food contaminated with stones though they did not charge for the curry but it is not at all acceptable from such restaurant will not recommend at all,1,
food was nice and good staff supportive ambience was also soothing interior lighting should be more contrast from the current so that food can be views before served,5,
"needless to say the place has been there for many years in banjara hillsgood that u have opened in gachibowli
i usually get delivery 
but the experience is truly great being there
some of the best north west frontier cuisine i have ever eaten 
i really miss the kofta e pashtun here 
will definitely order soon",5,
staff is super friendly and the great ambiance will give you the good feeling coming to the taste it is good with masala quotients so pretty much indulgence finally could be a 4 of 5 value for your money,4,
"we went for team dinner starters tasted very bad paneer was too hard service was very poor they took 45 min to serve starters and then they brought all the main course including rice at one go by the time we ate roti the rice went cold
overall a bad experience",2,
the murgh resham kebab n murgh kurchan were awesome the meal was satisfying and the service by tapan was very prompt and friendly we would like to visit the place again,5,
great food slow service great food slow service great food slow service great food slow servic great food slow service e great food slow service,5,
"food is not up to mark we went for a project lunch and it is not worth for money biryani rice is hard and it has no salt at all in chicken biryani they gave chicken tikka pieces not sure who asked them for tangdi kabab smells very bad

this branch is no where compared to gvk khan sab which is famous for their authentic city",1,
"so we have been here last week
ambience was ok types not so appealing crockery used for service was good
talking about most important part food
we ordered chingari murg patiala which is so called their signature dish it has so salty seems dish is coming from sea even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock but it was so salty you can not eat
steam rice was salty too
frankly speak we did not like food except reshami kabab rest of food was pathetic",1,
been to this place had the worst experience found hair in food not once but thrice and got plastic particle in shorba we have complained the management i am sure food here is cooked with least hygiene and neatness try avoiding this place,1,
very good service  went with my kids in saturday night amazing experience  paneer was really up to the mark  service led by mr tapan who served us was amazing  definitely worth another visit,4,
was high on expectations after visiting khaan saab in gvk i was disappointed with taste and quality of the food the service was mediocre and it seems to no make justice to call itself a branch of khaan saab even ambience seemed to be a cheap knockoffservice was okay,2,
"the restaurant was quite big and maintained very clean and neat with best hospitality 
have been here on friday evening  place was not much crowded and there was occupancy of only two tables 
ordered the below 
chicken tikka biriyani  this was mentioned as must try in menu card  it tasted good 
tawa mutton biriyani  it tasted good with aromas of spices 
paya soup  did not meet the expectations  it was not up to the mark  tried tomato soup too  it did not taste well  mushroom masala curry  quantity was very less and taste 

ambience  45

i unfortunately took my guests to khaan saab and learnt a life lesson  never tryexperiement new places when you have guests 

we ordered mutton galauti kebab mirchi chicken tikka and paneer tikka for starters what place does not have mint chutney when you serve kebabs yes they dint have mint chutney and galauti kebab was so difficult to finish

pata soup was no better too in main course we ordered tikka biryani and veg biryani and they dint have mirchi ka salan in this tikka biryani was sweet on taste it actually tasted like drumstick curry to me such weird analogy but true raita was the only thing i liked of all

they dint have lassisoda or milk shakes too i dint even bother to click any pics what a way to disappoint my guests ",1,

the food is okay not great does not really live up to the hype tundey kebab was good but a little bit on spicy side rajwada ghost was awesome

the staff was not very welcoming when we mentioned we will using dineout for payments and you could sense their attitude change the ambience is pretty standard and looks empty",3,
"an all time favourite of ours as you enter the restaurant you will find a big sized elephant near the waiting area little ahead on the right you will find a private dining rooms
fantabulous ambience with great food royalty can be experienced at khaan saab  tundey kebab will be stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try staff were brilliantcourteous friendly too they even had pan which was delicious

overallit is a place to have good food and spend quality time with your friends and family ",5,

we went for a team lunch worst food ever i had in recent times rotten smell in fish n chicken never ever visit this placei wonder how this restaurant got those awards,1,
"good for some biryanis and probably the ambience if you were to impress someone you host

as for the quantities served and the price wouldnt really be keen on visiting too often",4,
have been here multiple times because of the variety of dishes my mouth waters when i think about the dishes i like lal mirchi ka theekha tikka  is a must try chcien dish,5,
we went for lunch in weekday restaurant is with ok ambience and nizam style plates and glasses ordered biryani biryani full of masala and little rice jyadha masala thoda rice food taste is ok but not worth it food cost is peeeeeeekss one water bottle cost is 47rs highly costly food,2,
"we went to this restaurant for new year lunch and literally one of the worst experience seriously nothing was there in veg staters 34 items and in nonvg 34 items and desert only ice cream and fruit salad  and very expressive also ",1,
fantabulous ambience with great food royalty can be experienced at khaan saab went there for new year is dinner with family and the food we tried were yummy  lip smacking dhahi ki galouti will stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try other dishes we tried were paneer ka soola in veg lal mirch ka teekha tikka in non veg hari mirch ki roti in breads  angarey jamum in desserts all of them were exceptionally good only thing we felt was prices are steep for the quantity they serve but all is well when the food is great and ambience is awesome,5,
"as the tag line itself says be the royal guest khaansaab actually keeps up with it you are indeed welcomed as a royal guest here filled with its authentic awesome delicacies its an ideal place for a quality dining with family as well as friends
rajwada raj gosht is a must try i bet you would be mesmerized by the tender lamb pieces in the spicy curry",5,
"since there was a party going on in the main restaurant we have been diverted to a subsidiary of the same

literally worthless a shame to the fane of khaansaab

open doors full of mosquitoes no captain to advice on the order no proper care

been the worst dinner experience ever and to have that on the day of my wedding anniversary was disastrous

ruined my date

will never ever return here

thanks for totally ruining my date",1,
went out for casual family dinner tried the palak chat for starters it was yummm worth a try also tried mutton galawti kebab and a fish starter mutton kebabs were really good fish starter took lot of time to get served and still lacked the taste but disappointed with the fish starterordered peshawari chicken and few naans for the mains both the gravy and naans were up to the mark biryani was also decent it is a place worth a try,4,
"want to experience the royal food and service visit this place and you will not be disappointed perfect place to experience the rich favor of north indian dishes ambience is good with dim lighting service is good with friendly staff
delicious food would highly recommend the burani paratha do try other dishes too
and yeah ambience of banjara hills branch is better",4,
"ambience is good but the food needs improvement in all the aspects service was a bit slow too
this place is just overhyped and the food quality has to be improved
it is pricey and is definitely not value for money",2,
the ambience of the place is great the food was not to my liking i have had better biriyani in hyderabad i ordered a mutton roman josh the meat was really hard,3,
"it was a thursday night that we decide to go to this khaan saab  and get the feeling of being a royal guest

the ambience inside and the interiors were definitely apt to their punch line  it gives you the royal feeling

we ordered main course only as we were way too hungry 

butter naan
punjabi kulcha
chicken kurchan
chicken khandar

first of all i felt the pricing was a bit expensive but for the ambience and the royalty of the place i would buy it if the food is also that good

the butter naan had loads of butter to our delight and were very soft and worth it
the kulcha had potato filling but we expected it to be a bit more surprising given it was punjabi kulcha
both the side dish had shredded chicken in gravy
we were 7 people so while ordering when we ordered only two sides the waiter told us that one side dish suffices for only 2 or at max 3 people
given the price 380 we were amazed to hear this
however we ordered only 2 and when the food arrived we understood why the waiter said so in the first place

so we ordered one side dish later on and enjoyed the food the taste and the quality was really excellent for all the money

however there was another thing which stopped me from giving a 5 star rating to the place
we asked for the bill and everything in it was justified except the charge for water

we had ordered regular water so theu gave 3 500ml aquafina bottles and later on they gave a 1 litre bottle

and they charged 150 for that in the bill quite ironical when the mrp is 10 for these bottles
they charge gst and they charge water at such a idiotic price

we clicked many pictures near the giant elephant near the entrance the whole place was very well decorated and i could easily spend one hour just clicking pictures",4,
be it food quality or taste or guest treatment or ambience awesome will be the only word to describe the experience rarely i have experienced such quality of food whose taste is unique and really stands out would love to visit again with friends  family a special mention about restaurant manager mr pandab for his brilliant guest management skill and absolutely polite approach,5,
i ordered noodles and manchurian combo from this place first of all i would like to suggest management to send fork along with the food as they have only sent the spoons and needless to say you cannot eat noodles from spoon second the quantity was really less of manchurian some improvement in food is suggested,3,
a really nice place the ambience was very very good the views from here are killer but honestly for me and my friends their menu was not enough still worth a look,4,
food and ambience is average waiter is not serving the food properly we need to keep asking him to bring salads chutneys and all finally he demanded particular amount tip while paying the bill,3,
staffs are very professional it was an excellent experience we had chatpata tandoori kabbab was fantabulous the place is super good and must recommend for kabbabs,5,

was in gachibowli recently regarding some work and landed up in olive garden for dinner after seeing their reviews food was exceptionally good especially their crispy corn even their main course items namely malai kofta and chana masala were very good all in all a very satisfying experience,5,
food is good good for ordering for team lunch if you prefer not to go out ambience is not very good this is my personal experienceno offense,3,
this one is near to paradise gachibowli the ambience is decent and the service is fine we tried the pepper chicken for starters and then for main course we tried kolhapuri paneer with butter naan and tandoori roti pepper chicken but the quantity was too less for their price either the quantity or price could be changed main course was fine especially butter naan was really nice,3,
kindly stop listing north indian dishes like chicken chatpata i have not tasted any item like this smelling and tasting like only curry leafs just put me in a bad mood complete waste of money,1,
came with my family ordered pepper chicken corn soup rogan gosht and biryani all was testy it is good hospitality restaurant i would recommend 55,5,
i am visited olive garden with my team around 9 members we had taken buffet they served 6 starter it was excellent specially chicken kebab and appolo fish was very good main course was also good chicken biryani was awesome in desserts rasmalai was mouth smashing honestly we had enjoyed a lot ambiance is nice service was good and staff also it is a pocket friendly restaurant i would suggest visit once,5,
"sincerely i have never seen such a worst service ever management does not know how to speak with customers

we went for alacarte and taste of food is too low

even buffet experience is also not worth for cost",1,
been exploring about restaurants in gachibowli and found this place been to this restaurant ordered chicken drumsticks and spl chicken biryani which tasted really good finally ended with a good dinner as the taste was good ordered a non veg combo next day and surprised to see a cockroach in the meal it was really a bad experience to see a cockroach where the restaurant has taken away all the positive views that i had towards it please do not play with health of customers it takes time for anybody to order food again if we come across these situations please note that restaurants shouldnt be the place to hospitalise customers by making them unhealthy apologies will not do anything maintain healthy and hygiene environment thank you olive you lost a customer and i will not visit this place anymore,1,
"this is a good place for north indian food to have we went very late around 10pm bt they are open till 11 i guess we ordered golden prawns tandoori chicken bhuna murg butter nan the tandoori which was really goodonly the masala kulcha was not upto the mark and less pieces with no masala inside it this is a zomato gold resturant which can save you bucks

"a decent restaurant among pubs and restaurant in indira nagar to have some proper north indian food

in food i tried paneer tikka masala masala kulcha and some masala papad all of them were pretty good it has the complete feel of a family restaurant and the prices are also pretty reasonable the quantity of the food is decent as compared to the price

the ambiance is nice and the staff is courteous",4,
biriyani quantity is less,4,
"the worst place i went there with a frnd today we ordered manchow soup and alfredo penne pasta the service is damn slow soup did not have any taste
pasta was terrible they just boiled it and dipped into a bowl of white sauce nothing else",1,
"this place is just great was actually skeptical before entering the restaurant but then the crew were really humble when i first entered the whole place was empty but with in 30 mins the place was all full

their dishes were a great deal maybe not any different from the regular items but were really tasty and mutton rogan josh is a must try",4,
"it was my 4th order with olive garden in the last 6 months  i loved the food from this place and this is the reason i ended up ordering from here multiple times

this time it was a total disappointment in terms of the veg food and the service that was provided

there was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for veg dum biryani  veg pulao  both of these dishes were same i do not know how the restaurant makes that difference  still wondering

in terms of the service i ordered the food from zomato at 800pm and the time of delivery was shown as 855pm  i ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 930 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time

i would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with biryani  pualo

service wise i would rate this place a 25

the managerexecutive from the restaurant to whom i spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins",3,
after getting suggestion from one of my friends we went tonight there for the dinner we were two and ordered tandoor chicken virgin mojito cocktail veg fried rice and schezwan chickenall the items were extremely good and very tasty the price of each item in the menu was satisfactory the behavior of the staffs were also so calm and polite they accepted zomato gold too we appreciate the job of the cook and the staffs there the decoration and the sweet 90s music made the dinner fantastic loved to visit the restaurant and will surely visit again,5,
we visited this place on a weeknight so there was very less crowd the veg food was okay on nonveg side we tried their buffet they served soup with 2 starters salad and some veg starters the soup and the starters the apolo fish and the chicken kebab which was not even close to any kebab was good the curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate the place was comfortable and the service was quick,4,
olive garden cares  very difficult to find a restaurant where the staff is as good as the food maybe the first time i got the experience for which i have been shelling the extra bucks my rating is based on the food and the quality of service,4,
"came with coligue for buffet and found the quality of food was very good buffet spread also good starters was yammy desserts was amazing service was very good and teams are attentive we suggest to our other teams to come olive garden price is pocket friendly

really averagehad buffet lunch  served everything on table nothing great about it really average interiors food was just not bad but just above bad passing marks u could say in terms of food ambience and money wouldnt recommend it and big no for a 2nd timetried and forgotten,2,
have been here many times i was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006 its a quiet place and family friendly the lift is old dark and horrible it feels it will breakdown except that it does not they tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one coming to the food its just okay nothing outstanding or too bad starters and chicken items are usually good enough their tandoori chicken does not have breast portion i could not understand the rationale behind it its just leg thigh and wings and yes i do not know why they have downgraded their crockery they serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls,3,
"bought coupon from nearbuy  375 it was mentioned that the actual price is 469 which is falsei have attached the price tag mentioned at their hotel
i compared it with the other hotels near by and i feel it is highly overpricedit should be aroud 250
very limited starters and sweet items as compared to other nearby hotels",1,
read the reviews about this new place and ordered chicken dum biryani to try out the quantity was ample and taste was also good looking forward to go there personally and check out some of their dishes,4,
"we have been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since i am a big fan of starters
so as soon as we reached the spot we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the gachibowli area the interior was also tiny and seemed confined
anyhow we ordered chicken garlic chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant the staff were ok not quick but not rash though even though they got our food very late they somehow tried to convince us with something nonrelatable situations
forgetting all that we just wanted to concentrate on our food as soon as we had our first bite the first thing that came to our mind was  it is good but not great the flavour in the biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices
overall it is a place where you can visit once in a while if you staywork near gachibowli this is not a place to visit from a long distance

food  35
service  35
ambience  35
value for money  255

food was okay wish they did not put nuts in the pasta mushroom soup was good chicken and fish was delicious but too spicy i mentioned no spicy in the zomato notes but it was super spicy,3,

total disappointment",1,
after a long time i was satisfied with any restaurant by their taste and quality too i ordered chicken kalmi kabab and chicken boneless biryani kalmi kabab was awesome and juicy i can see a perfect amount of spices are used in that dish and also the chicken meat was tender now if i judge their chicken boneless biryani it was also as good as kalmi kabab chicken boneless biryani was served with raita and mirchi ka salan,4,

"new entry in zomato gold
ambiance 
olive garden is located at the time square indira nagar beside dominos pizza there is nothing much to say about the ambiance of olive garden restaurant this restaurant is very small with no live screening and no music ambiance is quite boring as they did not even decorated it much even on the saturday night this place was not at all crowded
food
we ordered chicken chatpati kebab as a starter cost approximately inr 255 the quantity of kebab was very less they served kebab with the green pudina chutney both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations then we ordered chicken dum biryani cost approximately inr 210
this was the worst dum biryani i ever had that i did not even tasted like biryani instead of dum they added so much oil in that biryani olive garden offers 11 dish on zomato gold membership
service
service here was too slow and the staff did not even give attention
overall
i do not recommend this restaurant to anybody because of the bad experience i had here",3,
the ambiance service and food what else is required to make your day better the taste was amazing and even the services by the management is great,5,
it is one of the best in gachibowli it is value for money the best item i liked is vegbiryani and sambar rice i always love to party there,5,
food is yummy,5,
"this is a gem of a place from the road it looked like an old restaurant but the interiors are pretty good the staff was very welcoming special mentions to khan and the person taking the orders 

we ordered schezwan chicken and corn palak roll for starters the corn rolls were soo fresh it tasted amazing chicken was spicy and nice too

veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains there was a lotttt of cheese in pasta taste was on another level biryani was spicy a little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor but rest of the items compensated for this

at first accepted the order but after waiting for 45mins they have declined the order least bothered to respond to the calls switched off the mobile i dont understand why do these restaurants provide their mobile number if they dont have intention to respond to customers in case of cancelling the order why should the restaurant accept the order first and y should they regret to decline the order that too after 45 mins,1,

phulkas was not delivered,2,
in time delivery,5,
too low quality,1,
"chowmein was mentioned as ur special item but it was more like plain white noodles mixed with lots of different uncooked vegetables
bhindi masala was more like a thick curry but could eat it somehow
the only good thing in the entire order was fulkas because i ordered fulkaas and i got exactly that",1,

soup was normal,3,
"ordered a lot from this place and went for dine in a lot of times as well the biggest issue with this place is lack of consistency it is okay for the price range but the quality and taste of food will be a surprise almost every timewe usually have
mushroom masala usually quite good with good amount of mushroomsgarlic naan nice and crispymixed raita this has always been good
in terms of ambience it has very less to offer and an okayish service",3,
taste is ok ok but service is slow usually ordered online quantity is moderate tandoori roti was not what we expected and panner dishes are sweeter,3,

we had d39 special paneer lababdar spicy
with butter pulka and mix fried rice with mix raita
that all was pretty good
and i specially like special paneer lababdar
thanks team delhi39 for such a nice food",4,
very poor quality food and service surprised to find such a restaurant on zomato seemed like they have taken customer satisfaction for granted please look into it,1,
i do not understand why do restaurants like these exist too when they are not interested in doing business the service is pathetic and their food is horrible i definitely feel zomato should do some quality check before approving restaurants like these,1,
even though all the odds of visiting this restaurant is not in favour i have decided to give this restaurant a try the food is below average and when told the same thing to the restaurant owner amit he gave some really irresponsible answer and asked us to leave if we did not like the food this is a very bitter experience that i have faced for the first time and i leave the option of visiting this restaurant to u,1,
super item,5,
value for money place taste is good for the price you pay a must try is there malai kofta and methi malai paneer which are really tasty ambience is not very good but food is good in taste,4,
no order was deliveredyour person fooling youhe told me to cancel orderlooks some fraud pl check or i will report to ceo,1,
lassi was not that good,3,
disgusting paneer chilly it was floating oil inspite of ordering dry i have snapshot which will make it clear quality of delhi 39 is going worse over time,2,
worse quality of food,2,
not good at allthe taste was bad,2,
bad parathait was plain paratha no stuffing,2,
less quantity,4,
very bad quality of food the nans and rotis were like papad and the curry was also not good,1,
the essence of paratha is stuffingif it goes down the paratha goes doewnif yr margin is low plz increase but if stuffing goes downppl may stop ordering,3,
quantity and taste is satisfactory lacchi paratha and missi roti is not good in compare to other items,4,
if you are looking for some good north indian food within your budget then you should give a try here  this restaurant serves decent food but there is no ambience so do not set your expectations for it  i have tried paneer dishes and chinese and those are really good,3.5,
paneer was not good,2,
amazing food,5,
awesome paneer but a little late in delivery but overall full marks,4,
i am fan of this place and using it for last many yrs the quality of manchurian was bad it was extremely oily,2,
very worst place had a bad experience place is filled with mosquitoes and food also very very average better to avoid this place if you are going out with family or friends,1,
paneer quantity is very less compare to other restaurants,4,
too late to serve,3,
wrong order,1,
the rotis where very stuff and non edible,1,
food was not good as before salt was less in each item,1,
very bad food,1,
"please refund my order amount as the food was pathetic today
it tasted pathetic and it was cold and not eatable at all
we had to theow it away",1,
wrong items delivered can not call back delivery guy got a call from restaurant and asked not to open delivery guy will contact you but never heard back,1,
as usual food is awesome,4,
pathetic services always not on time ordered food twice in 3 days both time got delayed for more than 40 min  moreover the guys on the chat says we will deliver next time firmly take it as an exception case  dont follow any rules they deliver when they want and if asked for the reason compensation a big  mark  dont ever use better go for foodpanda  swiggy,1,
visited this place at night had chicken biryani fish biryani tandoori chicken as starter food taste wise was good we choose in door ac seating need to work on cleanliness which is lacking in this place,3,
"yet another sunday evening it was quite late when i reached this place but it was not the time to shut down the restaurant as well it was shocking to see no one in the restaurant though

ambience was normal and there is nothing to hype about it the hotel is not kept clean infact there was an insect in the plate that was given to my first and i had to change my plate eventually service was pretty late considering the items that we ordered

i ordered chicken majestic and egg biryani  to be frank the food was disastrous u can not put the blame on the time i went as well because it was at 10 in the night the starter looked like gravy and tasted very and the briyani had no masala at all

starter  chicken majestic
rice and biryanis  egg biryani

ambience  2
food  1
service 1
value for money  1

bottomline  not again",1,
mutton biriyani pieces were rotten do not know how old the meat was and the ambience and cleanliness were disgusting save yourself do not try this hotel,1,
chicken peaces in egg biryani no response from restauraunt end taste also very bad improve your service dont repeat this other customers,1,
"i can say the best mutton dum biryani i have tasted in long time with great salan  the flavours are perfectly balanced it was my first order though i have never had it before this so i will have it again in future to know if the consistency is the same ",5,
the mutton biryani and tandoori chicken is good rest of the dishes are as good as pakwaan or shah ghouse  decent place to beat your biryani cravings,3,
delivery is very polite and food was awesome,5,
the chicken pieces in boneless chicken biryani are like stones and the dish spoiled our hunger very disappointed with the first order from here,1,
writing this review with stinky hands ambience an hospitality are very poor food is delicious but you have wait till your patience expires and you finish the food in 5 minutes and have wait for 30 mins went there in peek time,1,
not good at all tonight i went there ac section has different charges i tried alsaba special currie is also grill chicken neither of the dish was good only biryani is considerable,1,
me and my friend is where had a gettogether at al saba the biriyani was nice and the chicken also i think we order chicken tikka everything is good,4,
nice ambience for a low budget restaurant full paisa vasool taste and food quality good service if you are low on budget still want to have a good quality food then this is the right place for you,5,
the biriyani was great but ambience is not that great crowded mostof the time good for parcel of food u must order the mutton biryani here service is quick though,3,
worst biriyani it was got cockroach in water jug and no courtesy or respect to customer only starter is ok it was good once few months back,1,
this was ok but not tasty i have ordered chicken biryani here it was ok we can taste it once or twice because some one like some thing it looks good,3,
finally ate a biryani that i licked off the plate the portion size was perfect the biryani was flavorful and the salan was delicious again ambience of this place is horrible but the food is amazing will go again to try the haleem,4,
went there yesternight just to have that hyped irani chai but it will be safe to say that i was fairly disappointed the tea did not taste that good as i had heard cups were dirty and the tea was spilled all over the saucer,2,
"5 star only for irani chai and osmania biscuits did not tried any other thing
had irani chai of many popular places in hyderabad but this place serves one of the best irani chai and about the osmania biscuits it melts into your mouth",5,
they have really good bryani and starters overall food quality is good we did not find the whole wheat roties they are of mostly maida staff is good they will help you in choosing the menus recomendations etc we always feel comfortable to seat in ac room rather outside parking available location is easily reachable many times they do not accept the card payment so make sure you carry cash or they have icici atm in front of cash counter,3,
taste was not good,2,
quick delivery by atif,5,
good quantity good food but needs to improve taste,4,
it is nice,5,
the food is ok could be better but coming to customer service i rate negative the cashier is behaviour is utterly distasteful constantly talking over phone without giving a rats ass to the customer behaviour of the restaurant managers does not make the place seem safe especially when you are with a lady very uncomfortable feel avoid it,1,
good n on time,5,
assum service,5,
waiters are very rude and charge extra always check menu card before giving money to waiters and no cleaness  management should be strict with the waiters,1,
i did not received any order,1,
food is not good as previous quantity reduced and price increased price is 20 more than restaurant price chicken does not tasted fresh,2,
i ordered for full they delivered only half,3,
avoid this place for your lifetime if you want to stay healthy we have ordered mutton biryani and it had dead flies in it we thought it fell into the biryani bowl while adding rice into it but when my husband thoroughly checked the whole biryani we could easily see 3 within 3 minutes we have complained about it to the waiter and waited for 15 minutes hoping someone will come and explain what went wrong,1,
"i have been visiting this restaurant since 2010 i might not be able to comment on veg section as i have never ever ordered any veg item non veg did not disappointed me till date no matter is it tandoori grill or mutton biryani or haleem it will be one among the first choices for any non veg take away but one of the last among family dinning as bachelors yes we can go in a ruff n tuff zonequality 55quantity 55
service  45 good but not greatcost  55 i find it value for money
ambiance 255",4,
have been to this restaurant many times taste wise preferably better than all other restaurants next to shah ghouse i would say quantity wise one biriyani will be more than enough chicken biriyani with double masala would be a treat to taste buds go for it the chicken would be damn soft and good starters like pepper chicken chicken tikka tandoori all are good they need to work more on ambiance as the place is not clean moderate pricing and enough number of items to go with,3,
"found 2 dead flies in the biryani the other day my friend found an insect in the biryani avoid this place
horrible place and it is not good for your health management is not at all responding even after complaining the issue",1,
"this place is best for ordering food and parcelling it
this place has no much ambience
they have the best chicken biryani especially the 600 pack and is worth it
majestic chicken and tandoori chicken are good ones",4,
haleem of this place is 2nd to none must try for haleem especially they are providing much better wuality of food in this price than many other restaurants thumbs up to them,4,
"food is good food delivery is too late by the the restaurant person no fault by zomato agent ",3,
haleem was pretty good biriyani was so pathetic and there is a suspicious smell mutton tasted like beef disappointed took a decision to never visit again,2,
good delivery and taste also,4,
chicken should have been more cooked,5,
we did not receive what we ordered,1,
thank you,3,
ordered lollipop  got majestic delivered,3,
bad quality and order came late,1,
delivery time is more than 1 hour,4,
very worst,1,
the delivery executive is behavior was very very bad do not ever send a person like this again more than that he delayed my order also,1,
add deserts in menu please,4,
no quality in haleem,3,
"grilled chicken price does not match with the tastechicken biryani is price does not match with the chicken quantity ",1,
dint like itonly the skin looked cookedrest of the meat smells raw chicken,1,
size is small,2,
we have ordered family pack but we have received single pack it took 2hrs to get our order,1,
the meat peices were very less for the price being charged,4,
the food is nice tasty and generous in quality and quantity at a very reasonable price the place is always crowded for this reason ambience is not that great and you can give it a try,3,
curd rice not good,3,
overpriced,3,
quality of food was poor need to improve,3,
"awesome quality chicken has been cocked well i wish you to continue in the same way ",5,
good serve,4,
d,1,
speed delivery,5,
visited more than 6 times biriyani taste is really good as usual properly cooked rich flavoured biriyani clean dining area and service is also good,5,
went to this place after hearing great reports about its biryani tried chilly paneerokay veg biryaniokay rumali roti and kaju masala currybad the ambiance is below average and serving is very bad,2.5,
pretty decent taste of biryani i like this place as it is quick to serve and yet never loses its taste i always have the chicken biryani over here when i do not want to risk tasting anything new,4,
"food quality is not good and the restaurant is also not clean at all

service is bad and they do not accept cards  paytm

food 15
ambiance 05
service 15

i do not recommend this place",1,
there was a lot of disturbance but running area service was good but ambiance was not good  money is sortable biryani was not so good irani chai is good,3,
ordered alsaba special mutton biryani the quantity was good enough for 2 people with large appetite mutton pieces were soft and the taste is really good got very less pieces and the biryani is medium spiced they charge 5 extra on bill if you pay by card service is good,3.5,
"tried grilled chicken and mutton biryani here

the mutton biryani was pretty good and the quantity was great

grilled chicken was really disappointing it had very less flavor the chicken was completely dry and did not feel fresh at all",2.5,
"my friend too here for irani tea  
though i did not had any food over her the tea was good i had been here 4 time only to have tea when ever i visit hyderabad",2.5,
"another place fo delicious hyderabadi rum biryani and irani chai
there are numerous places across city for dum biryani and this is one of thr best although the spices used and cooking process is same every biryani in different in its flavour
this is a pocket friendly place available late night
both chicken and mutton biryani are good and they also serve fish biryani here which is also a must try dish kebabs are also very good here
coming to ambience its a huge place with chai cafe kind of ambiance but they also have ac hall for family section
service is the only terrible thing here even during the peek lunch time they say biryani is over and fresh hundi is awaited which is terrible
i mostly do take away here which is a better option

taste 4
ambience 3
service 3",3.5,
"usually visit this restaurant on fridays for lunch with office buddies the place is packed almost always at lunch time the food is mostly try your luck kind of a thing can be extremely tasty one day or totally bland at times specially their mutton biryani and tandoori items 
good value for money but surely needs to improve on customer service and consistency on quality",3,
chicken biryani tastes awesome from al saba restaurant but the only think i dont like is there maintenance which is too bad otherwise its really tasty and worthy too,4,
visited here n had chicken biryani 55 kolhapuri chicken 45 butter naan 455 must visit it if u wanna have a good gravy based n rotisnorth indian mughlai service was quick,4.5,
great quantity and good platting for my starters and other chicken dishes also good quality in tandoori they have to improve on the server and service too,3.5,
"the place should be visited when only having good biryani is your priority and not the ambiance hospitality or hygiene

we visited the place with office colleagues for lunch the food tastes average other than the biryani which is simply awesome we ordered tandoori chicken chicken hariyali kabab adarika chicken tikka chicken  mutton biryani double ka meetha had sweet paan in the end",3,
"tea was good food was ok reliable if you work late hours or just want to catch up with friends late night it is so evidently popular amongst the night crawlers ",3,
"the classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of when your service doesnt compliment the food one serves it sometimes leads to disaster walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that 

ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available the service time was also too much i found the waiters to be a little rude i can sense their awkwardness in serving to an odia table themselves being odia 
neways now coming on to the food the chicken biriyani does taste good as far as hyderabadi biriyani is considered other items such as mutton biriyani  paneer masala and dal were also good

its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in gachibowli it has a long way to go

"you might have heard about the really good biryani or the haleem or the irani chai of this restaurant but i am here to talk about this amazing paan they serve this is one of the best paans you get in hyderabad this paan comes with really nice tasty filling that you would end up swallowing it completely 

if you have not tried the biryani try it and do not forget to end it with the irani chai and the special sweet paan it is just the perfect combination",3.5,
"one of the best innovative burger  concept
the first bite when i had it was like how come i missed this kind of taste awesome must try cheers i go with mercury burger  as i am a cheese  lover ",5,
"must try place if you are very hungry late night  amazing burgers  even their veg burger tastes so good 
well my favourite late night joint for burgers",4,
great taste but not worth it there is not place for dinning open all night fresh can come with friends but not dinning as said was full of cheese,3,
this place is a roadside burger joint their million way burger is a must try the chicken is grilled freshly in charcoal and is juicy tender in texture,4,
i have taken 2 stars out only because of the time they took to make the burger no doubt the burger was very juicy and tasty but the time they took to make it was far too long,3,
"this is possibly the best burger place i have eaten at in around in a long long time being a hyderabadi you grow up to your local bakeruncle then came mcdonalds and other brands which were good but they did not feel quite homely and you could not necessarily see the theatrics of your burger in the making

gd is is a place to go to have a gastronomic experience not just in terms of the taste but also the theatrics

the polite owner will always be around asking you about the burger and always taking care of anything the bakers want

if you want to be more than just satisfied with your next burger i suggest you stop by gd is",5,
an absolute pleasure right opposite to dlf building the guy makes sure to give your burger the exact time and patience needed to cook it to perfection a delightful experience,5,
"doyouknow a burger is the short name but in fact called as hamburger and if you lay down all the hamburgers eaten my americans only in a year it circles earth 32 times

so why burger topic now because of my recent visit to gd is opp dlf that offers quick bites like sandwiches hot dog grilled chicken starters  most importantly their famous mouthful sized burgers
galaxy burger no wonder a fast selling pick for its grilled buns crammed with two layered cheesy juicy meat that over salivates your palate grilling bun might need a little tweak to avoid chewiness or i am that one unlucky chap followed by brilliant comettail hot dog with freshness in every bite and decent smokey atomicwings with a sweettarty bbd sauce finish but a little over grilled
though many of them choose this place for their speciality meat burgers they do have good coverage for eggvegetarians and heard antimatter burger is a worthy try overall paid 480inr

value for money yet filling one soul comfortably are the key reasons which can potentially bring you again

"ordered from this place since i was on the lookout for a big fat juicy burger they did not disappoint the galaxy burger that i ordered was huge the chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well the only thing i did not like i am a fussy eater was that the chicken was not a breast piece or some sort of filet it had some loose pieces of fat or skin which i am not fond of and that kinda put me off a pounded chicken breast without all those things in between holding the flesh would have been better ultimately i took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately taste was good though 
still trying to find a burger that can satisfy me",3,
the best steak burgers in hyderabad without a doubtconsistency to the t the taste never alters highly recommend all meat lovers to sink their teeth into the juicy steaks,5,
"have been hearing a lot about this amazing burger place opposite to dlf what an amazing join with live grill and freshly made burgers loved the friendly staff and a uniquely named menu ordered galaxy and milky way burger which were amazing and cooked to perfection the charcoal grill gives the burger a unique bbq taste with chunky chicken pieces in it

on rush hours the service time can go lengthy limit parking space the shop shares a juice center which is a plus point to grab some quick fresh juice or soft drink to go with your burger and is open all night

feels moderately over priced however considering it being surrounded by mncs and the taste maybe it is justified and definitely it is a worth visiting place",3,
love their bbq chicken and mercury burger  though service is little slow and eating area is small  if you can manage to take away then this the best burger at its cost,5,
one of the best tasting burgers in hyderabad i have tried many burgers in hyderabad but this place serves the best burger the charcoal grilled chicken with cheese is very delicious,5,
tried the mercury burger  it is cheesy burger with chicken stuffing it is a must try for burger lovers the ambience is pretty cool to visit with friends there no place to sit and eat the burgers are too good,4,
big fat juice burgers the best recommended are milky way galaxy and big bang even other chicken dishes such as chicken wings and full bird bbq are nice and tasty please go to the venue and order to enjoy 100 flavour and taste,5,
"packing should have done in a box ",4,
meat in the burger was little uncooked and hard to chew,1,
i think it justifies its tagline worth the waitthey generally take around 15mins to prepareprices were bit highits a place for a quick bite,5,
i have been to this place on my friends suggestion ordered one single chicken burger i do not remember the name exactly the chicken is grilled to perfection chicken piece is enormous than burger infact when you bite the burger its not the burger which goes into your mouth its the chicken which goes into your mouth first they have also stuffed alot of cheese into it good taste for a street level burger place but there is definitely scope for an improvement,3,
great place to enjoy americanburguers my favorite is cosmic burger i been recommending this places to all my friends goodfood lovingit sizzling,5,
"ordered chicken milky way burger at 3am and realized mcdonald is and burger king are nothing compared to this burger
can sleep with happy tummy",5,
the burger was tasting sour maybe lot of sour sauces were added,4,
simply awesome tried milky way mercury and cosmic burgers and the comet tail hotdog all of them tasted great the chicken has a deep texture and a nice smoky feel do try out this place,5,
the paneer sandwich i ordered was not even grilled properly the filling was just too bland,1,
visited the stall of this outlet at ibs last month ordered veg burger and veg sandwich the panner which was inbetween both burger and sandwich was awesome really loved it somewhere i felt the prices are bit on higher side and very less vegetarian options,4,
quite good for burger lovers worth the money and milky way is my best choice here foodloversnightfoodtastyteampartiesone of the best burgers i had,4,
extremely spicy,2,
"ordered the cosmic burger and the comet tail hotdog 

packaging  great packed in aluminium foil wraps the burger and the hotdog were neat and clean without any spillage 
quantity  abundant i was literally full in half a burger
taste  brilliant the chicken was succulent the fillings and veggies were fresh and crunchy and the bread was soft and melted in the mouth

would definitely reorder",5,
sandwich was nice,5,
out of so many options available in gachibowli this place is definitely a hidden gem limited options on the menu but almost all the non veg menu items are good recommendations would the half bird chicken wings in starters big bang and milkyway in burgers only drawback is if there are too many orders the chicken remains a little under cooked some times ask them not to hurry and take time you will enjoy the dish,4,
okay  looks over priced to me,4,
a heaven for meat lovers a perfect solution to your burger cravings their burgers are equally delicious and unique just like their names milkywaylover,4,
"amazing burgers they haveyou eat it once and you feel like having it more and morei and my friends are delighted  the barbeque grilled chicken burger is a must try ",5,
ordered the asteroid burger and it was the best burger i have ever had in my lifepotato wedges crisp and spicy the sauces were bang onthe melted cheese on a layer of seasoned veggies the bread could have been slightly betterthe main usp of this burger is that everything blended perfectlycan not wait to try more of their burgers,5,
"got a galaxy burger home delivered from this place for my lunch and i now i realise what all the hype is about the burger is really finger licking good with ample amount of cheese and sauces
coming to the quantity i would suggest a single layered cosmic burger would be good enough for a light  medium eater as this is extremely filling",4,
"i ordered parcel  instead on three layer cheese they put only one piece cheese in burger this happened twice with me cheating with customer who order online not happy ",1,
"really appreciate the service of the restaurant and the concerned behaviour of the owner for his customers at first when i received the order the burger was cold due to late delivery but when i complained the owner personally called to me and apologised and repeated the order this time sending his own delivery person and the burger was amazing to the owner thank you for being so concerned there are very few owners like you who make sure customer s are happy keep it up ",5,
"after dandiya session  we decided to try this place near my hostel which is open till 3am or so

galaxy burger looked appealing as some else had ordered it before us tried it and fell in love

amazing taste  amazing value for money fresh buns tasty chicken and they customise it to ur taste specifications",5,
pathetic experience from packaging to the product itself it failed to appeal to my hungry stomach i gave up all my hopes when i received the burger like this the experience of eating the burger itself was no surprise i will not order from this restaurant ever again,1,
awesome they listend to my special request i am a regular customer and they never disappoint,5,
awsome food and nice delivary guy,5,
"cosmic chicken burger 
gd is barbecues and burgers is a small shop located exactly opposite to dlf office here they serve juicy and tender barbecues and burgers
the burgers made here are really good they marinate the chicken with desi spices and herbs they cook the chicken in such a way that it is tender and juicy
this is not a place where you can sit with your friends and have a bite i recommend this place only if you are street food lover and planning to grab something to eat on the go
each burger at this place costs around rs150rs200


price 150
taste 810
ambience 710",4,
"big bang
three layers of bbq chicken strips a cheese slices and some lettuce it is a nice tasting marinade but if only they did not over cook it
you keep the chicken juicy for that is what makes a burger you will need someone who understands the timing and temperature to keep the chicken juicy

constellation
it is more of a mutton sandwich again the problem here is of over cooking the mutton started to crumble while eating and the binding gave way

otherwise for a 2 am food cravings this is one of the best places to go at",4,
"ordered a burger from this place and it is so disgusting to see a burger wrapped recklessly in an aluminium sheet deliver at my place how can you wrap a burger in a sheet by the time i opened the pack the burger got compressed cheese leaked all over the sheet

the taste of the burger was not good too the bun did not seem fresh at all i still do not understand how this place has a 44 rating",2,
best burgers as always,5,
it was typical gds hot dog fresh chicken and perfect blend of all sauces and seasonings goes very well with a frisat night party you will surely love it,4,
"having heard this name so often lately we decided to order from here on a sunday afternoon

quite a small place which is mostly suited for just delivery and not a quintessential dinein 

we ordered the jupiter and antimater burgers oh so amazing heavy filling just the right amount of sauce and spice fancy names but the paneer filling was delicious

i think we made a wise choice ",4,
"this place is epic for anyone who wants to have a luscious juicy bbq burger there is so much hype to this place and at first you may find 220rs for a galaxy burger my personal fav a little overpriced but trust me on this guys it is totally worth it for all burger loves this is the place to go ",5,
ordered cosmic and galaxy burgers from this place the taste was distinctly different and delicious is an understatement the chicken was tandoori style and not a patty so that was one new thing it was juicy cheesy and the bread was also fresh this is the first indianised burger i had and i am in love with it the galaxy one of too much for one it is that filling the cosmic is also same to taste but can be finished by one the packaging was good and simple and the burgers were moderately warm when they were delivered it was a very good experience please give this place a try,5,
i have ordered home delivery from this place and i would definitely recommend their pole star burger yummy grilled chicken and oozing cheddar cheese absolutely delicious,5,
"ordered a jupiter burger from here and it exceeded my expectations 
had a nice layer of charred vegetables and layers and layers of cheese the taste was brilliant and size was humongous thoroughly enjoyed this too good ",4,
"ordered via zomato poor packaging the burger got squished the chicken and sauces were quite tasty though
the packaging should probably be in boxes",3,
"not a nice experience
the burger had a grill impression but was not cooked and was raw
the fried veggies was not having taste
the dip was also not interesting",1,
"best grilled chicken burgers in town 
found this place highly rated on tomato so we decided to give it a try and were completely impressed by the lip smacking milky way burger
the owner was a really cool person btw",5,
gd is is just excellent,5,
been there on a sunday night for a quick snack and ordered milky way burger and thunderstorm burger these two burgers were different from each other in terms of texture milky way had shredded chicken combined with creamy mayo and a cheese slice this is a must have for anyone with a craving for cheesy and creamy burgers thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice the burger just melts in your mouth must visit place for bbq lovers,5,
it was not too good what i expectedlots of potato were there in stuffingguys burger will not have potato too much,2,
"i ordered the galaxy burger burger and dip was poorly packaged and squashed inside the single layer of foil could not find cheese inside the burger expected more chickenit was advertised as double layered for the price i paid235delivery i expected more burger was tasty


edit i am changing my rating to 5 stars after talking to them it seemed that this was an isolated incident of misbehaviour on the part of the delivery guy and gd was in no way responsible for it they apologized and gave me a free burger with the next order which was in good condition and delicious",5,
"now that s what we call some authentic chicken burger they can give the big names like burger king and mcd run for their money any fine day these uber tasty charcoal grilled burgers are absolute food nirvana the soft and tender chicken breast well coated with local desi masalamarinated  are grilled till they turn golden brown a double slice of the grilled breast serves as the filling for galactic burger which is my personal favouritethe burger buns are soft and sweet

they have other options too like hotdog and sandwiches which are damn tasty basically their usp is the grilling process of marinated chicken breast which makes them uncontested winners of best burgers in cyberabad the place is in mid of bustling dlf area which makes the place pretty accessible you may have to be patient enough to catch hold of your burgers as it takes minimum 15 minimum to grill the patty must visit place for mouth watering burgers",5,
"a hidden jewel serving probably the best burgers in hyderabad and that too at a steal of a price

you probably wouldnt notice this joint infront of dlf hyderabad but for the crowd that throng during evening hours  and if you have had a burger or a hot dog here and there is simply no place you can go to satisfy the cravings they create 

do try their cosmic burger paneer hot dog paneer burger

the sauces that they put with the cheese is lipsmacking

i have been a fan and i am a regular here try and you will not be disappointed

"this happened on a pleasant  while i decided to have a burger i have ordered a galaxy burger which has charcoal fried wingsbreast pieces to my bewilderment i found charcoal  charcoal fried  like embedded javascript in static html page  so i would like to recommend this place if you do not have charcoal in your toothpaste they will give free charcoal in burger u can later apply paste and brush your teeth i can personally assure you it is of the best quality probably the coal gd is use has better quality than that used in coal power plants and post washing your teeth with toothpaste you can save electricity wondering how just open your mouth it instantly becomes a bulb and one more thing which saved me while i was on a pitch black road three men approached inorder to mugg as soon as i opened my mouth they ran away the luminosity of my teeth was around the same as the sun isps i used pepsodent for better results pss i used this super power on my solar water heater
4 for mr gd who took my experience and resolved it ",4,
venus hand down the best burger i have ever eaten finger licking food takes a little bit of time to cook the food but it is totally worth the wait the spicy minced mutton patty with cheese inside on top and melting from sides is just heavenly the pepper bites with egg and minced chicken are to die for just go to this place and enjoy the best food in town,5,

the best place to have a burger is gd is milky way burger is the must try dish as the cheese flows between the burger and the bbq chicken slice is awesome and mouth watering,5,
the bun is not fresh the burger was moist and wet,1,
"the rating is such because of the name
we had thought it was like an american grill restaurant
shocked by the indian spread 
food was ordinary 
no choice in red meats and no grill
pls change the name gives out the wrong idea",2,
i was on a work in financial district and it happens to be lunch time so finalised this place after some search i parked my car outside and walked inside it was completely empty as i enter into ac dining hall man o man full of crowd i literally waited for 15 minutes to find a table as the staff is completely busy with existing orders not the new customers so yeah service needs to be improved after finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good next time i will try some more recommended place if you are a telangana cuisine lover,4,
"good out door sitting restaurant to spend some pleasent evening time visited this place which to close to outer ring road and nankaramguda it offices it is a quite and less crowded to have andhra style spicy food we ordered babycorn manchuria chicken lollipop and chicken biryani food was bit spicy but manageable and good chicken was well cooked and tasty quantity was bit less when compared to it is price range and it is compititers but still it can be miantained well

i just love this place good ambience it is very pleasant in the evening away from the traffic and crowd it is a great place to organize any events especially in the lawn area the lighting adds to the elegance,4,
the food is amazing good value for money ambiance is beautiful a good place to hangout a must visit restaurant a perfect place for friends and family,5,
useless they serve alakarte items as prasadam and empty customer pockets it is not worthy quality and quantity is poor once you visit then you will never visit there in your life time i dont recommend other customers to go here jaagao grhak jaago,1,
since this place is close to my office and they serve south indian delicacies i have decided to go there with my team this place has got that simple dhaba vibe and the food they serve is lip smacking if you are nonvegetarian this place is a must try also if you are here do eat their kadhu ka kheer in desserts ever since i have tried that i ensure that i order this every time i go there and recommend this to friends and this one has never let us down,5,
"me  my friend we are looking for quick lunch on a friday noon in financial dist and we spotted this place decided to venture as this will be our first visit

it is was exactly at 1230 noon when we entered restaurant and found there was hardly any one outside landscape place for sitting is very good there is inhouse place with ac as well we chose inside as it was already too hot ambience is descent and nothing very special but is good

food we kept it simple as nawabi chicken kebab which was special on the day we visited and chicken biryani kebabs were really nice biryani was like fine not so very delicious at same time it is not bad service is fast

while if you ask me will you visit the place again i might start thinking as i found place outside more interesting than the food that does not serve purpose so i am sure you got answer

interesting was by time the clock ticked 1245noon my goodness entire place was filled with people and many we are waiting that made us think probably there is something else special about this place which we did not order so if at all i go there next time will see to it i taste it ",3,
"we always use to order their kodi pulav which tastes sooo good few times and just okay some other times on zomato but recently we visited this place to have dinner

so we ordered chicken manchow soup which was okay okay in taste cuz manchow noodles are not fresh since i could smell the oil in noodles but quantity of chicken in soup was good 

kothimeera kodi pulav suggested by the server is actually pretty tasty but i wish there was little more kothimeera in it  taste was very good thoughprices are little high",3,
"tgrill is on the main road next to icici campus in the financial dist spread over an acre it has both indoor and outdoor seating the outdoor seating is midst of neatly done green lawns with small and large hut shaped structures

we started with grilled fish that was basacod fillet skewered upon coals it was spicy and tasted well with green dahi chutney the paya shorbasoup was extremely spicy but very tasty  then we had kottimira chicken mutton dalcha with bagara rice for the main course that came as a recommendation pachipulusu with the bagara rice also tasted awesome on the whole all the dishes we tasted there were awesome except for the heat from the spice

authentic telangana and andhra signature dishes will definitely try again for the rest of the menu recommendations",4,
"third class attitude rude staff pathetic food is what defines this place good luck if you happen to stall here by mistake

a basic order takes more than half hour food lacks taste and staffs think they are over qualified for the job they are doing",1,
this restaurant never fails to dissapoint me this time ordered chicken biriyani from zomato and this is what i got just bones and fragments  upon complaining to the restaurant manager made fun of me saying i am trying to con him as i might have already finished the chicken or hidden it and now trying to get more for free asked me to complain in zomato and that is exactly what i am doing,1,
i have been here for a team lunch with my colleaguesthe ambience is different one and very nice place to hangout with friendsthe food they served had excess oil be it veg or non veg if you are a spicy food lover then this will disappoint you,3,
"this place is not exactly vegetarianfriendly they cook everything in the same dish and i am guessing they use the same oils did not eat here but thought people would like to know
service is quick for the starters they took some time for the main course
friends say the food is alright
there is outdoor and indoor seating place is clean throughout and it looks like the hygiene is good
gets really busy in the afternoon because it is so close to the it hub",3,
went for lunch on that day  i order veg biryani but found insect in it  worst service  it was totally bad experience  ambience is not good,1,
"pretty good ambiance very spacious and huge one

food is amazing except the oil quantity that they use prawns dishes were not that great only prawns starter ie golden prawns were good

gongura chicken is amazing

service is very fast

would not recommend lassi at this place as its not the proper one it is very watery and tasteless

management is pretty cool and open to feedbackthey humbly accepted the fault in dishes and replaced them

can be improved a lot would surely pay a visit again",3,
i went today at lunch time service is very bad they dont now how to treat customer they will not suggest what is the special today taste is good but improve ur service service is very slow i call many times to the service boy but he is not responding proper hotel environment is good and taste is awesome but i will not satisfy the service,2,
"one of the best places i have been to this winter perfect ambience and what i loved the most was
to beat the cold they provide a hot charcoal basket beside every tablegives you the perfect winter warmth even on a busy day of the week the service was on spot just like a dabha where everything seemed to be on the move and full of buzz  the food was always known to be typical telangana food but somehow felt it was a little close to telangana cusine and more of a quick dabha serveloved the ragi sangati combo perfect bowl of rangi sangati with a dollop of ghee with 4 accompaniments like mutton pickle chicken curry daal and pachi pulusu ordered their famous pulavs as well

ambience  45 stole my heart with the charcoals
taste  35 would love more authenticity
service 4
quantity  3 can improve a little for the price point
value for money  3 maybe because it is located in gachibowli

overall rating for this place a decent  45",4,
peaceful ambience and good food will be crowded over weekdays as it is close to multiple it companies food arrives suprisingly faster and tastes good too,5,
great place to dine with and enjoyed the ulavacharu chicken pulao tastes good it is a perfect venue to enjoy some of the special andhra dishes with a starry night view it has a beautiful ambiance and wanna visit again,4,
i was looking forward to have good time  enjoy some good tandoori food i liked this place with my previous experience have been very goodso was looking forward for the same reached this place got a seat which had full of mosquitoesi can not argue much of it as it was a open space but they dint attempt to place a mosquito coil the service guy was least attentive we needed to search him to place the order so ordered tandoori chicken boneless harabara kebab n veg pulavthe very first bite but tears in my eyes as it was very very very spicy  harabara kabab is spice level so beyond my imaginationwe just could not eat it we asked them no make the pulav least spicy but this one was like a bomb we all went to have a good time but dint get anything of this sort will never try this place again spice lovers i guess this place is for you,1,
my friend ordered the ulavacharu chicken bone pulao from tgrill the price was high but the taste justified it it is one of the spicier foods i tried in hyderabad i always though hyderabadi food was spicy but i never came across anything very spicy this one was spicy enough to be memorable it is one of the best pulaos i have ever had you will definitely love it,5,
restaurant with lot of open place and average food went with friends for lunch what ever we ordered veg or non veg started  main course all are not upto mark no one of us r happy with food served serving is fast ambience is ok,2,
delivered on time and the food is very tasty and good quality all the items taste good and even the kids enjoyed the food  overall the food is very good,5,
"i recommend it for elderly
disappointed  with taste have tried starter roti  biryani taste so so normal
but every dish is less in masala and has below normal taste
not a good place for hangout",2,
seemed like the biryani was over cooked,3,
ordered ragi sankati and kodi kura unlike other speciality restaurants the preparation is mild less spicy and less masala loved the taste ordered curd rice which actually is not good they should look into it overall nice dining place in that part of hyderabad,4,
quantity of biryani is very less,4,
wonderful food especially grilled ones awesome place to escape city environment and have pleasant evening without traffic grilledchicken,5,
"biryani taste is not at all good

"great place to have a peaceful lunch with a gang of 34 people it has a pleasant atmosphere with both indoor and outdoor seating in which the outdoor one is the real fun place is quiet neat and clean it also has telangana style

worst mutton biryaniuncooked n without i ever tasted and restaurant should feel shame to serve spoiled kheema pulau i recommend do not go to this place at all,1,
"we ordered keema pulao n britain n paneer in vegboth of them tasted like flavoured rice with semi cooked pieces
even kadai paneer gravy was not well cooked

restaurant ambience is also not so gud",1,
"been here for dinner they have both open air and restaurant style sitting we opted for open air the ambience is dull could be more brighter the food service was fast prices are reasonable the quantity for biryanipulao is sufficient for 2 the food is a bit spicy taste is good

visited for dinner service is good ambience make you to feel freeordered soup chickensarter bagara ricekodi kura all are satisfactoryprice ok,3,
the hotel is full cheating we are very much disappointed  it is not worth going  buffet is full cheating we are fed up   the varities are less and the buffet is like alakarta  food is also so so,1,
"i have to say tgrill has the best menu
the nonvegetarian items are awesome
and the taste is also good
i am impressed
thank you nithin bro ",5,
ordered chicken biryani from this placeworst biryani i ever tasted in my life i never expected such tasteless biryani from a place like this in hyderabad if you are looking for good food you must avoid this place,1,
"this is it if you are in the mood for some telengana good head here keep in mind that their biryani is just about average of not meeehhhh but the rest of them daily specials are so so so delish and spicy really spicy but you would be licking your fingers

i have not seen anyone come here to try their chinese and vegetarian as i do not think it would stand out at all but again their bheja fry their iguru their kheema and the meats that they have are amazing their bagara rice along with the kheema and mutton iguru was too too good

i will definitely give them a try again at least to check out the daily specials",4,
"it amazes me to see the current rating of the restaurant on zomato the taste of food service and unhygienic foodambience describes a holistic and gloomy conditions of the restaurant
the food quality has degraded with time i would never visit it again",1,
"restaurant food ambience weather was sexy it was drizzling when i visited drizzle made more exciting  all were good except staff i almost waited 30 mins for food
though i liked the place ",3,
"ordered a nice dinner for two from t grill the prices are mediocre and i placed my order late night via uber eats following is my experience

service the parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated the delivery boy called once he was outside our society 35

presentationpackaging it was a usual packing nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it 35

food food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added we tried the following

paneer pulao it had a nice quantity sufficient for two there were average number of paneer pieces it tasted quite yum the masala was ample inside too spicy which killed it is essence 355

gobi 65 a good quantity for two it tasted like a typical fried gobi nothing extraordinary the usual 35

will i order from here again i will only if they decrease the spice level despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water",3,
"nice place for lunch around financial district
i visited with my team and tried their biryani and kebab both were good
food here is spicy and tasty but do not expect much on the ambiance

nice place to eat around it hub",4,
awesome place to be during evenings must try kunda biryani it was well cooked nonveg starters and this place has a good ambience outdoor seating is nice,4.5,
food was good  tried biryani and prawns dishes both are good  nice garden ambiance  service was good but waiting time wasnbit high compare to other restaurants,4,
one word yukk  uncooked smelly grilled prawns  tasteless chicken biriyani  both kunda  dum served by dumbest waiter b narasimha  when reported the quality gave irresponsible responses that he only serves and does not bother about anything else,1,
"great place to have lunch or dinner with a group great atmosphere and you get a feeling of being close to nature as everything has a triballike theme also indoor seating is available but the outdoor one is the real deal here

though the food is pretty much average nothing great do note that waiting times are huge and it is better for groups than just 23 people",4,
this place is the best bet for authentic telengana house old favourite bheha fry kodivepudu and kheema pulaov why do you need posh indoor ambience when you can munch on tasty bites under the moon this was one of them were we dint have to wait for the serving and friendly staffloved food and the quiet and pretty decent setting if you dont mind spending a few bucks its a must for quick bite,5,
"as far as i can remember this is the best chicken pulao i ever had
the sole reason im stll writing is because zomato wouldnt let me finish in 60 words",5,
average food bad service open place and good to sit outside and eat on a breezy night but not enough to visit again due to the food quality and service,2,
really amazing place to hang out with friends and family ambience is perfect for clicking decent pictures definitely a treat to the taste buds,5,
bad ambience ok food  soups were great had some non veg starters which were not very tasty and felt a bit raw  naans and curry was nice horrible biryani roaches in sink  x,2,
nice food had here nice biryani nice service nice ambiance can be improve the air contionerrest every thing is good looking forward to come again,4.5,
"average food had here only the part is price reasonable but did not liked the taste of food  had chicken biryani and other starterswhich not like last time visit  ",3,
"open sitting arrangement good to go in the evening
tasty food with decent price try the cocktails or mocktail its nice 
good service
have large area for parking
can improve the ambiance by keep it more clean and decorative",4,
it used to be good since last few months food quality and quantity changed they will serve any grass in the name of palak not suggestable at all,1,
a decent place to get away from the crowded restaurants this restaurant is an open type one on a sprawling area  i would suggest going for dinner and not for lunch as these are hot summers we were 4 of us our family ordered natu kodi biryani butter nan and paneer butter masala  the taste was good portion size ok food is expensive relatively but the cool breeze and the ambience made up for it and we enjoyed the night,4,

went there the other night with a couple of friends for dinner and i was truly disappointed the food did not taste really well and the ambiance was not great too the rice was polished a bit too much and the pulkas felt like papad had good expectations from kothimeera chicken but it was all bland on top of all of these the waiters demanded for tip yes they demanded how much tip we leave,2,
"i could have given a 5 but then cleanliness could be improved especially in lunch timings  a regular visitor only because they have the best ribs in town  ummmm they just melt in your mouth  awesome spicy food a good ambience place has potential ",4,
"recently had chicken biryaniand natukodi vepud  it is horrible experience food was ok ok m but coming to hygiene level it was totally disappointed  table was not at clear asked the two times for clean plate ",1,
we went to tgrill yesterday for lunch overall experience was very nice food  service ambience and location everything was very good nice place to hangout with friends  family,5,
star is only for ambience and average food  here they also serve food which is cooked one day before i got served raw biryani and kababs  food is not fresh,1,
the food quality is not that greay but a good place to go and hangout with friends they have a good area for kids to play the food can be improved and the service needs to be improved,3,
"best mutton biriyani i ever had also try fish its the best from the first time i tried biriyani here i always ask when people suggest restaurants is it better than tgrill or not

regularly order from here",5,
"a randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave but the moment i opened what seemed like a kitchen door i was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some south indian meat man this place is an oasis in the puppalguda desert
we being mutton lovers ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli our eyes shone the nalli did not disappoint us we then dug into the chops all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on youtube were redeemed this mutton chops did the deed the meat was not the slimy fatty kind melting off the bones but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies then came the main course  rotis mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour  a bit more sour and i wouldnt have cared to write this review the meat was invisible we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton it was just mystically omni present in the meat i guess this is what you would call divine food
amen",5,
been here multiple times and the food is always goodvery good ambience in the eveningsonly issue is their food is spicy even after u mention it to be low spicy,4,
"on the way back home from mrugavani national park had a stop here for lunch i really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing first impression no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it all were parked zigzag welcomed by foul odour at that point
huge place but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further like where to sit or dine especially if it was first time like me initially noticed an outdoor seating organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables felt like scorching sun breeze wouldnt make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread no one cared to guide until i personally asked of any indoor is available
so shifted to inside dining room great relief finding at a corner a place for us our order was veg platter  not worth price taste quantity jumbo chicken biryani  evenly cooked tender chicken not so flavorful mutton biryani is good
service lag may be of huge rush missing fine dine features asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside
village back drop artifact greenery are little bit saviors may be at evening hours outdoor seating could be good choice anyway no thrill at t grill",3,
a different place which used to serve finger licking food service is very slow only instant ice cream is amazing i can give 5 stars to the ice cream,2,
good place to hangout with large number of peopleservice was good and fastfine and nice dining placemenu has the regular cuisine and which has a great taste as well,4,
good place to pass time with buddies in the open air varandah restaurant ulavacharu veg pulao and kaju masala are my favourites here service takes time during daytime as it is the most happening place around the it corridor,4,
a different kind of taste for chicken loversveg is not that goodone time visit is not bad idea and it has huge open space for dining and staff is also co operative,3,
horrible service  tasteless food poor service worst ambience too costlywill never visit again to this restaurantveg and nonveg food both are worst,1,
yesterday we had lunch at tgrill we ordered chicken wings and panner kabab chicken wings were good and panner kabab was just okay naan and panner butter masala is good we ordered chicken biryani and it was substandard and we are disappointed ambience is good for night dinner,2.5,
"firstly this restaurant is very untidy and noisy the ambiance was the worst and it is crowded and untidy place so couples who want to have a good time please stay away

however the food was ok you can visit this restaurant once to just have a taste of the dishes i still wonder why most people prefer tgrill despite all its negatives 

overall rating 25 just ok
taste of food 35 average
ambience and cleanliness 15 worst
service 255 below average

thank you  for reading please follow me so that you will not miss my latest reviews",2,
worst experience in sense of service we came to this place group of 9 people they were taking forever to take the orders we received piece of hair in one of the starter we had to seek the people to take our orders quantity of all the starters was very less every time we needed to ask them to serve they were leaving the starters just like that on table all the dishes were average or can rate them below than that as well none of them was extraordinary waiting for main course was more than 30 mins,2,
"it is situated after icici buildingspread into huge place 
went for lunch here ordered masala kulcha tasted ok murgh malai kebab was good and kheema pulao  which was special dish that day  was good  but it is always crowded due to the offices nearby ",4,
a good place for some telangana taste the grill items are really good the biryani here is tasty and prepared with good ratio of rice meat and spices in perfect proportion a little above budget pace but a good place to hangout with a projector and some bonfire under shacks,3.5,
"i  went with my office team and was disappointed with the cost and food taste

we tried mutton kunda pulav and it costed us 349 inr but was not worth it and taste was not that awesome

ambiance was good though ",2.5,
"located near varun motors
been to this pace for lunch
place is huge with good outdoor seating
ordered chicken corn soup boneless chicken kebab chicken and mutton biryanis
chicken corn soup is ok
chicken kebab soft and tender tastes good which is worth a try
mutton biryani is ok

cons  no proper service and waiting time is more

overall ok",3,
"heyy veggies good ambience
food i should say is not so appealingvery tough to recommend or think of any standoutbutter roti is good in breads
service is good i should say
let is talk about do not trys
manchow soup
mushroom starters as a mushroom fandisappointment
this place would be in my choices with hangouts as priority and not food",2.5,
"great ambience and hut style ragi mudda combo was so tasty and fish is awesome must go with family 




",3.5,
"had heard a lot about the place so finally decided to make a visit specially because it was quite close from our place it is very spacious with lot of fresh air and tables at quite a distance from each other the staff is very courteous and quick

now coming to the food the paya soup was horrible but the staff was quick to replace it and suggest a better option which was really good
nice rotis and tasty biryani the star of the evening was the methi chicken extra ordinary flavour and a very different taste definetly to be tried

one place on my list which i know is reliable",4.5,
"they have the best andhra cuisine in hyderabad i could not try much tasted mutton seekh kebab and mutton biryani mutton was cooked properly you can feel the aroma and softness while eating the ambience is great and prices on menu are reasonable to try once in a time

happy eating",4,
good food value for money we need not wait for much long after the food order it is really fast good place for people how want spicy food if u ask they would less it is as per ur requirement,4.5,
"went here for a team party the food was top notch and tasted quite different from the usual ones if you are looking for a change for your taste buds  go for t grill
the service can be improved a bit otherwise everything is perfect 

ps this place is not for you if you are not a fan of spicy food p",4.5,
very bad restaurant wast of money and worst quality of food especially birney and starters its better to go to buffet abs with that money worst quality of food,1,
"it is a disaster
worst food ever
too costly for the worst food
all the chicken curries are worst and never recommended for anyone
worst experience ever",1,
"great value for money spent natural ambience felt happy spending the time

ambience  5
food  4
photographic location  4

loved it

eat what you can",4,
i can not explain the feeling i felt when i started eating the two most beautiful things that exist in this world butter naan and kothimeera chicken,4.5,
"been here with my team mateschicken kebab chicken drumsticks like tangdi kebabs fish kebab was all very tasty and goodchicken biryani was not that great it was ok 
overall a nice place for starters 
outside sit out place is good than inside ",3.5,
lovely place to dine on my day off i often visit there they serve good briyani their staff know well about their food and portion size good suggestion by staff about food,5,
ordered because i wanted to eat momos so much and dlf area is popular for street food but i am disappointed the momos were undercooked and dry had ordered two veg steamed momos and i felt sad because it neither fulfilled my cravings nor it filled my tummy the closings were hard and uneatable,1,
so it is 1130 on a friday night most of the restaurants are closed and we are hungry we find this restaurant still delivering with ratings more than four we order veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos we get the delivery on time and the food is not bad schezwan sauce is steamy hot and delicious but both the momos on the drier side hence going with 35 for this restaurant,3,
"i ordered the steamed chicken and fried chicken momos
the momos are pretty terrible especially considering how much they are asking for it i have had cheaper and better momos from roadside vendorsthey also made my stomach upset which is a sure sign of them serving old and unhygienic food since even the roadside momos have never done this to me

i would definitely steer clear of this place especially if you have ever had even half decent momos from anywhere else  also this is the first time someone has given mayo with momos and i can confirm that the combination is as disgusting as it soundsif you have poor taste in food or have a stomach made of iron then sure go ahead and order from this farce of a momo joint otherwise learn from my mistake and let it be the only one to have occurred",1,
"all the hyderabadis out here anybody who here who loves street food obviously dlf is out there for you  but do not forget to look out for this shop you would find steamed and fried momos but it is very rare to find kurkure momos have you even heard about those wanna grap a taste  go to dlf right away  
it is mouth smacking",4,
one of the best places to have momos in and around gachibowli located right opposite to dlf this place is over till late night my favourite is the kurkure momo here tastes very different from all the other momos must try,4,
paneer fried momo was yummy thank you the mayo and sauce was good momos could be more softer fried was too crispy taste could also improve much more,3,
"watching ipl and ordred norfest thought of adding some appetizer to my mealordered kurkure momos vegetarian

arrived nice and hot and on time

problem the fried kurkure felt fried on stale oil the coating was really thick tasted more of the oil coating than anything inside

sauce was mayo and red sauce i am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos antways i tried the red sauce  thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it

lessons never order fried momos again ever may try the steamed based on rating",2,
"i am addicted to their chicken kurkure momos

it is so yummy thanks for bringing momos culture to hyderabad hoping to see this culture springs a lot in future",5,
i never had a good momos until before i ordered from here always thght momos were overrated but momos delight proved me wrong i ordered veg kurkure momos through zomato and they were lipsmacking good the redchilli chutney and mayonnaise were good combination with the momos also they were delivered to me when they are still hot zomato is service has never been disappointing,5,
it may appear slightly expensive for momos but they truly taste as amazing if not better than the best momos you had in a north eastern indian city especially the steamed chicken momos with the masala spread and the super spicy chutney perfectly compliments it,5,
"want to enjoy best steamed momos this is a must visit place chicken or veg they got tasty momos here
they provide momos with mayo and red sauce",4,
ordered momos from here many timesthis place is good for momo lovers like mei have tried their kukure chicken momo and steamed chicken momo and both are nicethe price of kukure momo is a bit high but it is crispy and tasty so worth a try,4,
we have been a regular customer of momos delight we usually order kurkure momos its super tasty can give 5 stars for tht couldnt click a pic of tht we finished it fast and the next one is fried chicken momos thts also a must try,5,
i would not recommend this place i tried their steamed momos and kurkure ones too which were not upto the mark they dont serve that spicy red chutney that was a bigger shock for me,2,
"the best in n around gachibowli the best among all no doubt the shop is small btw quality is good and worth the money u pay try it without hessitating
good good good  ",5,
i have been here and had it is momos it was not that great so i had ordered chicken steamed momos on zomato and was disheartened to find that the momos have degraded further in it is taste the outer covering was dry and not well cooked it tasted like it was not freshly made the filling was not satisfying at all moreover the salt was a bit over the top the sauce served was excessively salty and tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chilli paste not good at all i had been in their shop quite e few times but this time it was really disappointing,2,
i have ordered several times from this place and their kurkure momos are simply awesome they taste just how you get them in delhi even the fried and steamed momos are good but can not beat kurkure momos,4,
"one of the best places to have momos had ordered quite a few times from this place through swiggy and zomato delivery was on time and packaging was good
chicken momos were simply awesome liked it chicken fried momos were also good 
mayonnaise was nice momo sauce could be better though",4,
"so on one of the weeknite i craved for momosmost of the delivery points were closed except thisso thot to give it a trydelivery was delayed and that made me lil upseti ordered two things veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos

veg steamed momosthe packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil boxthe filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my moodthe veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good eitherthe schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo
chichen steamed momoall of the above applies though the chicken smelled as if it was day old

highly disappointing 2stars just for the zomato valet",2,
"known for its momos
been to this place couple of times
had fried momos in veg and paneer
momos served with mayonnaise and spicy sauce
tastes good

overall ok",4,
i had ordered veg friend momos and the momo had no filling in it  giving 3 starts because of last time is decent experience please take care while packing the food,3,
every time i am having a good experience with delight momos the taste of the momos is so amazing kurkure momos is outstanding n superb  it is one of the best outlet for momo is lover,5,
misleading outlet for vegetarians owner lied when asked about maintaining separate utensils for veg and nonveg never visit if you are a strict vegetarian,1,
"momos delight
the chicken kurkure momo is were a true delight and so were the chicken momo is which were sprinkled with some special masala the only downer was the red momo chutney as it tasted like tomato sauce i am sure if they can make authentic momosthen they can also make authentic momo is chutney",4,
ordered steamed veg paneer and chicken chicken was okayish paneer was nothing but onion veg is a total no no on a side note who gives out mayo with momos  very pocket friendly though,2,
the best momos in hyderabad i have had so far right on dlf road easy to find their chicken kurkure momos are just wow excellent food at a reasonable price,5,
one of the best momos place in hyderabad i ordered chicken steam momos they were like delhi style momos red momos jauce is spicy and many momos have good amounrlt of filling with thin outer covering packaging is also nice and clean,5,
chicken momos is fine i have tried veg before that is also good but the problem is mayonnaise these people use readymade mayonnaise which tastes really horriblespoiled instead they should start making their own,2,
"food quality is very poortoday i ordered veg momothis quality of food is very worsti can not able eatdont buy from
here such a shameful service",1,
i ordered a home delivery of steamed chicken momos since it was the bestseller the momos tasted old and chicken tasted lemony the sauce was traditional red sauce that had no flavour because of excess water added and other sauce was store bought mayo i had to throw the momos away,2,
5 tiny veg momos is what you get for rs75 hyderabad is paradise for food lover but this place is a blot on hyderabad added a pic this is what you get in momos please avoid,1,
"i loved the concept of kurkure momo is and was lucky enough to savour the last plate of the nightsuper delicious and all time favorite ",5,
"ordered momos from swiggy and this is what i get stinky and broken momos

i have never seen such worst and bad momos ever in my life

i will never order anything from here again",1,
momos here are really tasty and especially the steamed momos are steamed properly with a thin outer layerfried momos and kurkure momos are also good,4,
i did not got the order and i kept calling the delivery guy and he was not receiving my call i do not know what is wrong with the delivery boy literally pathetic service,1,
i orderedered fried veg momos from this place which were pretty good not very spicy filled with veggiesnot too oily but the quantity was disappointing for the price it came for,4,
"if there was minus rating i would have given that
momos were cold",1,
"its one of my favourite places to have momos im addicted to this place perfect steamed momos at affordable pricing they have the fried momos n kurkure momos which are a must try too happy dining yall ",5,
"a small kiosk among the many eateries opposite the dlf building a friend recommended this place as authentic delhi style momos so stopped by

at around 9pm only steamed chicken momos 605 were available they were absolutely steamy hot soft and delicious inside the thin momo skin was a large filling of minced chicken meat minimal veggies just perfect

momos were served with a nice spicy and tangy red chilly chutney and a dollop of mayonnaise that i left somehow the combination of momos and mayo did not work for me

they have crusted kurkure momos that werent available but hope to try them sometime later

here is my overall score
food  55 chicken filling 
ambience  na
service speed  55 instant  but availability 
vfm  55 60 for 5 is very good for taste and quality",4.5,
"i chose veg kurkure momo is from this place after hearing lot of mouth reviews
momo is very perfectly fried and very crispy from out filling was good
accompaniments of mayo and red chuney were sufficient and tasty",4,
excellent momosordered kurkure momo and steamed chicken momothey are just fabulouswould like to order next timelovely food,5,
"the best kurkure momo is in hyderabad
the paneer n the chicken kurkure momo is are just awesome i dint try veg so n also paneer n chicken steam momo is are very good too would love to know the recipe of chicken kurkure momo is from the chef every body loved it in my office too thank you",4,
"best momos till date in hyderabad city  keep up the same work 
stuffing is tasty for both veg and non veg
me and my colleagues liked it a lot",5,
"got delicious streamed veg momoz ",5,
delivery was great,4,
nice taste but chutney quantity needed to improve,4,
found died mosquito in foodyaak such worst taste,1,
"finally some momo joint with consistent taste and quality really love all the variety of momos they offer good price great taste a delightful thumbs up ",4,
i loved it  would have given 5 but giving it rating of 4 as sauce and mayo quantity was very less ordered 2 plates though got sauce and mayo only for 1,4,
"the veg fried momos were so awesome the spicy dip and sweet cream were stars of the savoury dish
looking forward to order multiple times further",5,
mayonnaise was not included,3,
the momo was smelling and tasting really bad like rotten meat i ordered from here regularly but this was the worst experience i had to throw all the momos away zomato needs to have some quality check for the restaurant they include also please do not share my number with the owner i do not want to be contacted,1,
did not find any taste in chicken momos the veg momos were horrible stuff inside the momos were not boiled properlywill never order from them again,1,
taste was good but you provided only one mayo packet and 2 chilli sauce for 3 momo orders and the ones provided dripped onto the package because of loose package,3,
great work aavula,5,
must say the best momos i had in hyderabad is here there fried chicken momos and kurkure chicken momos both are just the best highly recommended,5,
"it is one of our favorite place to have famous tibetan snack momos i have tried almost all the momos that they serve ranging from veg and nonveg steam  fried and paneer kurkure momos
it tastes similar to the ones available in north india i mean delhi however i think the portion size is quiet less as 1 plate has only 6 momos
ambience 15 just a small booth outside dlf gachibowli
location 45
taste 55
service 55
value for money 45 portion size is small",4,
delivered before time in hot condition,5,
got the food delivered on time without delay thanks to zomato delivery person,5,
"a nice place to have momos whatever maybe the variety they offer i have tried all kinds from this place and can now safely say that you get a delicious snack with spicy sauce which makes it the right combo at a very affordable price
i have mostly ordered online multiple times with satisfaction every time",4,
good food but price can be reduced a bit,4,
food was cold and seems like prepared few hours ago,2,
"one best momo stop in town
from do not know how long i have been looking for places that serve good momos in hyderabad and found none recently ordered from this place and turned out they are just the best momos you can have i ordered chicken steam momo and kurkure paneer momo and both of them were very delicious home delivery was very quick",5,
excellent delivery,4,
delicious momos matched expectations,5,
cold,1,
half cooked,1,
nice deliver boy by good behaviour,5,
good delivery and start paying our tips to the delivery boys cz i asked and they saidthey do not get any tips what we pay online as tips,5,
delivery personnel was excellent,5,
"good work
",5,
good service by delivery boy,5,
great service,5,
the food was decent however you should keep pan fried momos i loved the red chilli dip you can also serve chilli mayo dip,3,
it was not hot and no chutney and mynoese,2,
poor service bo chutneys added,1,
big fan of kurkure chicken momos served here i used to like chicken fried momos first but now kurkure momos come to my mind as soon as i think of momos,4,
"fall in love with the momos ",5,
kurkure momos here are yummm they are really veey tasty,5,
great place and yummy momos try chicken steam momos taste great worth the price great people to severe awesome momos to fill an hungry stomach,5,
really good a little spicier coating for the kurkure momos would be nice tho,5,
i asked them to send extra sauces they didnt do it after assuring also food was good,3,
size of the momos could be improvedotherwise taste is fine enough,4,
the chocolate excess cake was awesome it was a completely filled with chocolate ganache it is fairly priced it is not bitter in taste the cake was moist and juicy the ambience of this place is good nice place to hangout with friends,5,
the chocolate brownie and waffles will take you by an awwww for someone who craves for chocolate it is a perfect place the ambience is just decent,4,
"in general my experience with the chocolate room was not up to the mark
i had oreo cookie shake and kitkat shake at two separate visits both tasted bland and i couldnt quite get the crispyness of oreo and flavour of the kitkat
i hope they improve ",2,
went there for morning breakfast but what a disappointment everything out of stock no nachosno stock for their signature chocolate pizzas i seriously wonder was it a way denying customer for using zomato gold privileges or what cz first i placed the order the waiter said it will take 15 mins but when i showed him gold unlock he simply said its out of stock what a shame,1,
"bad service at this place overshadows the good food
they are clearly understaffed and the existing staff seem to not care at all about the customers
the place felt like a heat box when we went there as they did not care to switch the acs on",2,
"the worst experience we told them that we will be unlocking zomato gold and they said yes come the bill without gold benefits then they started arguing with us that we did not tell them about zomato gold
ps do not order pasta here  or maybe do if you like sloppy goo",1,
"chocolate room
a must visit place for all the chocolate lovers
this chain has been around for more than a decade now and they still keep me amused each time i visit

i tried dark chocolate fondue the dark chocolate was flavourful thick and glossy the dips were very well coherent with the chocolate and they are all 100 eggless

potato wedges poutine was another dish that i loved the most and you should not miss this it has white sauce pasta base with well seasoned potato wedges

the pancakes were fulffy and are perfect when paired with hot chocolate

service  was bit slow as we went around 10 pm but the staff is really attentive 

price reasonable price for the quality and the quantity they serve",5,
it is a nice place but i did not have a great experience with their home delivery i had ordered pasta via swiggy and they sent the wrong order i complained and got the order sent again the sent the wrong item for the second time around as well poor experience but decent when you go there and eat,2,
did not really enjoy much here its a dessert place so you go with a mindset to increase some kilos but the desserts were not so good the ambience quiet dull and boring have not gone there since,3,
not worth for money ordered french fries and chocolate milkshakewaited for so much time after ordering waiter forgot about the order and came again for taking the order,3,
nice ambiencefast servingnear to my place enjoyed it ordered shake and brownie it was amazing hest place to visit witg friends it was quite rush on fridays and weekends,5,
"place have good ambience
gold benefits are eligible even on shakes
we ordered shakes on sunny day
service is slow we have to go to service counter and asked twice for taking order
smooties are okish they are not thick shakes
pricing 35
ambience 45
location 55
service 25",3,
it was such an disappointment agent mannan was so rude to me also i ordered 3 kits of from chocolate room although i received only one i would say it was a worst experience i felt so ignored,1,
the food is quite decent here but extremely over priced from the coffees to the cakes everything is over priced and few days back i bought of hand made chocolates for my roommate and they were not upto the mark according to the price,3,
"it is actually quite nice ordered pasta cold coffee waffles
the taste was yummy
it is a cute care like ambience with small television screens that showcases matches and music video
the service is good",4,
"we ordered four different ice creams
1 chocolate ecstasy
2 chocolate chocolate sundae
3 chocolate banana split
4 the chocolate room brownie sundae
and all of them were same",2,
one of the best places for a hangout especially if you are a couple or a group with the rich ambience of a chocolate filled aroma and delightful lighting it would definitely be one of the best place to go they have a variety of hot chocolates and coffees with subtle differences only a true lover would be able to appreciate,4,
this is a good place to hangout as they wont kick you out no matter how long you stay the playlists played are really good food is just up to the mark if you just want to hangout and are not a food critique the ambience and service are good except for the occasional cockroaches that run around,3,
really disappointed after receiving my cappuccino  i had ordered through zomato app only and they delivered the coffee in a disposable juice glass covered with foil worst experience of online ordering never order online anything from here,1,
i am disappointed after last night is dinner i had here i was visiting tcr after a long time and ordered a dark on warm mug salad and a mint mojito while the dark was awesome the other two items disappointed me the salad had very raw cucumber and it gave me a bad stomach pain from which i am still suffering they also gave a plastic fork to eat a salad which has chicken cucumber lettuce capsicum and tomato giving plastic fork to substitute real cutlery is way more disappointing than anything in a place as reputed as tcr the mint mojito was a tad bit less disappointing the syrups flavor dominated all the way till half the glass,2,
to be honest it is an average place to hang out the cold coffee or drinks made by me tastes better than what is served here minimal efforts have been done to maintain customer satisfaction almost all the items tastes average and not worth the money,2,
"first of all very classy ambience you will just love sitting here and pass your time while nibbling on its starters
do have oreo shake
panner and corn sandwich i had to eat this because i went with a vegetarian friend so sorry for that cant tell you what to have in non veg you can connect to free wifi and work peacefully too if you are a workaholic",4,
"the place lost its charm and service things like drinking glass with bottle of water that too 1 glass in the whole restaurant  serving plate with food is something you have to ask for tissue paper on table is missing again ask for it in all my last visit as everything have shelve life  rip chocolate room ",1,
did not like the quality of chocolate ice cream served with the pancakes tasted as if it was laced with some chemical gave a metallic taste to the palette after few bites was also dissatisfied with the waffle very rubbery was difficult to cut lastly the service was poor and rude wont bother going here again,2,
love their sandwiches specially tandoori paneer grilled sandwich the place has a great ambience the prices are little high but quality is good,5,
the one which i always eat here is chocolate sizzlerbut now i feel it is not worth to visit chocolate room for chocolate sizzler as the quality is decreasedsizzler which we got this time is having so much of brownie but they dint think of giving enough chocolate sauce and also the brownie is over cooked,2,
great place for chocolate lovers my kids enjoy it every time the cuddle cup concept is too cute chocolate fondue is to die for the staff is a little untrained could do with some more sophistication,5,
ordered chocolate brownie from online the pic was sooo good but in reality its not that much lol anywaz it was good nice brownie,3,
"the traditional chicken sandwich was amazing but the earl grey tasted like salty water 
will be back to try the pastries environment was pleasant but could have been a bit cleaner",3,
"have been to the chocolate room at other locations so visit to this one was quite awaiting like the ambiance and the aroma of hot chocolate that fills the restaurant a good place to date definitely a little heavy on the pocket staff is friendly 
we ordered

 chicken cheese sandwich

 chocolate walnut sundae

 hot hazelnut

the staff needs to focus on hygiene there were cockroaches around the billing counter which was really disappointing we pointed the same to the staff the washroom was bad no tissues or handwash ",3,
this outlet is the worst i have ever seen  there were cockroaches on table  food quality was bad and no one to take order on time please go to some other outlet do not ever try this outlet,1,
"absolutely love this place best place to visit for a cup of hot chocolate in gachibowli
do try hot chocolate in one of the cuddle cups with someone you wanna cuddle too p  staff is courteous ambience is really nice pocket pinch is totally worth it
i will not get tired of recommending this place do try pancakes and waffles and hot chocolate here",5,
"great place for all the chocolate lovers you will find all varieties of chocos in this shop
ambience is goodservice is also good food items are also good",3,
"tried pizza and spaghetti looking at the reviews not sure how this place has 3 rating

food taste not that great and specially at the price you would expect some quality or effort in it

pizza had an uncooked base and the sauce they used on the base was normal sweet ketchup a few bellpeppers on top and rest was normal cheese not what you will expect after giving 250 bucks for it same with spaghetti came in a tiny box no garlic bread on the name of aglio olio it was just couple of olives and olive oil and nothing else no herbs seasoning or flakes",2,
ordered the chocolate avalanche the quantity is too much that easily 3 people can have it in dessert hence the price is not too costly if you keep the quantity in mind it was a brownie and ice cream kinda mixture which was too chocolaty and perfect for the chocolate craving the waffer became soggy in it and did not taste good they should start serving a smaller size too so that we can order for one person too at a lesser cost,4,
"ordered swiss chocolate cake from here

nice when it arrive packing is good

could have used nice quality ingredients to make it better as the cream was like some powder mix

would try again if they improve the cream of cake

thank you hope the restro improves",3,
bounty milk shake 15we ordered a bounty milk shake and that was the pathetic so called shake i ever had in my life so far and the price was rs 189 which was not even worth if given for free a normal tea from office pantry tastes far better than this drink i dont have an option for giving a negative rating hence forced to give a 1 when its not even worth to have a rating we were so hungry and planned to have some food but we were so tired with the shake given and we packed up without even finishing half glass of the drink i will never prefer this to anyone even the restaurant offer for a free treat,1,
have been a fan of chocolate room since years and this ones really disappointed me  a worst experience an awfull taste and they call walnuts as almond,1,
"the chocolate options at the chocolate room gachibowli are amazing
i personally love their chocolate avalanche 
the ambience of the place was good with friendly staff around ",5,
"the worst ever pancakes i am not even kidding it is a total waste of money and they delivered something way different than what was mentioned in the menu hope they improve ",1,
"this is one old good place to have deserts since years
i have visited many outlets of chocolate room at himayat nagar banjara hills and this
the best i feel is gachibowli chocolate room
they have little app offers too
 oneone on pasta
sandwichthickshake
etc
do checkout
alfredo pasta isna must tryyy 
the paneer tikka sandwich could have been better",4,
"sinful nothing describes this place better 

going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired but the service is so appalling probably you will die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive the place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment i would recommend you do that cause anyway they deliver orders after forever 

as the name goes i have always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar and hence i have never tried the savoury items offered here but i have heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos so that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes 

the toblerone shake and the kitkat shake are the shizzz so full of the taste actually well prepared the chocolate brownie is really a waste of money you have probably had much better brownies all over hyderabad 

nutella waffles and death by chocolate pancakes so good  a heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream make sure to hit the gym soon after p

slightly higher on the price point but worth a try ",3,
"superb place went to fulfill some early morning cravings easy to locate it as it is situated in the busy street of vinayak nagar gachibowli ambiance is nice and calm they have separate kids play area and a party hall for celebrations the place can easily accommodate 50 to 70 people coming to food we ordered 1 garden fresh sandwich it was really loaded with some nice veggies and perfect amount of cheese and toasted to perfection 2 the veg cheese sandwich again it was yummy and had roasted mushrooms to go with onion and cheese 3 oreo cookie shake  sweetness was just adequate and flavour was awesome as well though they can do something with the thickness of it as it was way watery for my liking recommended ",5,
very poor packing,2,
pancakes not cooked properly,3,
"we ordered cakes shakes and hot chocolate the cakes were simply amazing shakes and hot chocolate was alright
the ambience is good we sat there for hours at ease and did not realise time had gone by
good place",4,
"hazelnut coffee 25
poor quality the coffee already had sugar and it was watery
this was my 2nd time here and the place still disappointed me
might not come again",2,
"i ordered hazulnut delight however there was no hazelnut flavour the beverage was all spilled in the plastic bag it was delivered in
not a good experience ",1,
it is just like the other chocolate room outlet i have visited and the only difference i noticed here is the missing cycle service is good but it is unhygienic even though it does not look like one chocizza and sandwich are worth trying here it is accessible to gachibowli residents and it is located midst other leading outlets,4,
food was cold,1,
have been delivered a very bad version of this cult favourite dish of chocolate room did not give ice cream instead it was clearly whipped cream,1,
"nice and subtle environment to hang out with friends with really nice food however the staff can be more cordial
food is really nice do try out their chico brownie sizzler with vanilla ice cream also try out their mushroom and cheese penne pasta if you are a white sauce pasta fan

taste and qulity good packing bad,3,
ordered toblerone and kit kat milk shake from this placeboth looks same and tastes also sameits like boost and bornvita milk without any cream or any icecreamboth are mixed with more water and less milk and chocolate syrupsspoiled our taste buds by ordering from this placewaste of money never order again,1,
amazing food with the sandwich being thr very best being a lover of non veg this veg combo was sooo good,5,
i am totally maaaad about chocolates so when i came across something named chocolate room  you could imagine my happiness as expected i was so confused about what to order because everything on the menu looked delish i ended up ordering a choco crunch mocha the ambience was so cool for hangouts and the service was good too the prices were reasonable i would love to go back there pretty soon,5,
"a nice place to hangout with friends
a lot more to explore about chocolate dishes here
a place with good ambience
a place with late night food  chocolate dishes upto 12 in night",5,
"the chocolate room i think the name itself is a like a bliss for chocoholics well it was around 6 in the evening  i was not even hungry so i had to order something light

i ordered for a kitkat milkshake
it took a little bit of waiting for the order to come the main thing was that it was not chill when served i felt the milkshake would had tasted much better if was more thick it kindof lacked that real chocolaty flavour

the place was fine to sit  talk well nothing much to mention about the ambience",2,
food is not good,2,
taste not good,1,
i got food that was completely different from my order,1,
low quality,1,
the so called cheese dip tasted like peanut chutney had a good experience with this place before but previous delivery was disappointing,1,
good place for celebration with small group of friendsfamily the service need to improve hot chocolate and and paninos are favorite combination for me the crisp of bread and sip of perfect hot chocolate can make your day,4,
taste and quality is good may be a bit more better,4,
provided seasonal fruit as banana which is not expected,2,
"ordered paneer tikka and garden fresh sandwich with oreo shake 
paneer tikka  55
garden fresh  55
oreo shake  45  as it was not so cold 
staff  15 if you request them some changes they would behave like kids and are not flexible at all removing a topping would not cost them anything but they deny to do so something which is terrible out there

overall the ambiance was not so good ac was not working properly and it was a bit dull out there

fab  best chocolate room service food ambience everything was very good best place for chocolate lovers chocolate sizzler was amazing,5,
this is not the one we expect and this is not the brownie shake which doesnt had any flavor of brownie worst shake it has only milk and sugar that is it loss of time and waste of money,1,
i ordered cappuccino and got black coffee read orders correctly first,1,
taste was super but size was small,4,
chocolate quality is very bad considering the high price it tastes similar to an equivalent 30 rupees milkshake you get in cartons i so lodge recommend this to anyone,2,

the gachhibowli chocolate room is a nice placei thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food on all of my three visits so farhowever the quantity as shown in the menu is never the same on ur plateexpect always a half filled stomach once u return back after spending comparatively a higher amount than any other meeting points like ccd,3,
mocachino was not hot,1,

late delivery plastic found in food bad service,1,
found them on zomato website a very interesting to say that this restaurant carved a niche in serving juicy  chicken wings with wide spread of 10 to 12 sauces especially texas bbq spicy garlic too yummy and spicy like original hot and amazon wild comes in to top of mind did ordered their bulk wings of 20 pieces and chicken drum sticks tossed with theses sauces were amazing dyna pasta served here  with white sauce is a perfect balance with a little spicy over all they have apt combination of mojitos like lemonade and strawberry one can have a very good combo biryanis served here us very special like wings biryani and drum sticks have a large quantity matched quality as well over all its a best and only to discover a new taste of their popular chicken wings at a very reasonable place,5,
out of hunger and trust on the restaurant i ordered a chicken burger from american wild wings gachibowli hoping it would be tasty and healthy but the kind of service i recieved was really pathetic at first the restaurant took almost 40 mins to prepare just a small chicken burger i tried calling restaurant about the update and they werent even responsive did not answer any of my call i kept my patience and waited for the order to arrive aftr receiving the order what i saw was really a bad experience the french fries that i used to get always were replaced by some oily smelly rotten potato pakodis not just that i hoped my burger to be nice but it was again a big disappointment the very first bite of it tasted really bad chicken seemed fried to be in very bad oil and smelled filthy i had to throw it after my first three bites and then after sometime i even started having pain in my stomach  this particular experience of mine was very disappointing with american wild wings i did not think of myself to waste money wait for an hour and still get suffer after eating that food,1,
i have ordered from this place a couple of times and i loved the burger and fries but last night the burger i got was undercooked and reeked of vegetable oil it was completely inedible writing this review to bring it to the management is notice so they can fix this and make sure it does not happen again,3,
worst chicken popcorn had ever in my lifestrawberry mojito is goodbut taste of chicken is not at all goodi did not recommend it to order popcorn,3,
"so on my latest visit to this amazing american themed place i had an amazing experience we kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant there were desi and videshi khaana both
we started off with the forte of this place wings we had texas bbq chicken wings amazon wild chicken wings and pattaya thai chicken wings i personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings chicken was rightly done in every single dish preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there the only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified
there were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings

coming to the salad  i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks 

the fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy it was an instant favorite

kuch desi khaana we had in there were gongura chicken and dum biryani combo shocked well hum bhi hue the but lemme tell you it was a delightful combo  gongura chicken being the best  a must try


some snacks we had in there were chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too the nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top  the popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted 

taste wise  455
price 55
ambience 45
allover 485 a sure visit",5,
"visit by invite

located in a buzy spot this joint has definitely some good food to offer

we tried a host of items from the menu starting off with chicken nuggets which were the show stopper next up we had chicken wings which to be honest did not excite us too much apart from the barbeque chicken wings

fried chicken burger had a tender and juicy patty served along some good french fries chicken popcorn were a major disappointment and the raw material used did not look fresh chicken drumsticks gave nice visual as well as taste appeal to keep the show running we had caesar salad on the side which definetly requires a revamp and the joint can play with salad dressings spices rather than having it served just with mayo

in the end we had biryani which gets served under the brand of fireblast biryani this biryani has still a long way to go and in order to beat the best of biryani is in town need some more experiments with flavors

while food here is decent the ambiance requires immideat attention the entrace was cluttered and the back of counter was clogged with unwanted items a bit of touch up in both food and ambiance can turn this into a 5 star rating experience thewandererfoodies

thewandererfoodieswordpresscom",4,
heard through word of mouth that this is best place in gachibowli to taste quality chicken wings  special wings and drum stick biriyani at an economy price been there for a dinner with my family ordered chicken wings hulk comes with bulky wings they did served us with about 10 sauces of american asian and mediterian like paataya thai texas bbq  amazon wild  parmesan garlic  spicy garlic and also with a touch of local flavours like achari  konaseema served  we enjoyed great taste of juicy wings along with fresh lemonade orange and strawberry mojitos ordered main course special wings and drum stick it was so delicious and tasty with perfect dhum flavour along with juicy tender wings and chicken drum sticks would like to visit again,5,

"hello hyderabadmy review of the place comes after multiple visits that have spanned over 4 months and now i can safely say that it is one of the  awesome food court around hitech city and gachibowli it is  located near the dlf signals and beside creamstone gachibowli above thick shakes 
the ambiance is a bit dim after dark and the seating is divided into various options including a pdr section

the menu design with array spans of continental chinese and indian cuisines here is the list of things that i have tried across all my visits

red hot roasted chicken wings    juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with mexican                                                                   jerk suces yummy unforgettable 

crispy chilli corn kernels  the usual favourite this one has a slightly different presentation here

drum stick dum biryani
omg very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it 
drum sticks   nachos topped with red sauce and i just  loved it  
combos   the true fact i have ever seen even in kfc mcdonald is such awesome combi within a convincing budget loved it 

i cannot stress enough on how i have loved all that i tried here i have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far the variety may not be as elaborate as other places but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings it is at least a onetime try but what i really adore here is their mocktails sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight also a fan of coke float

the staff is ever so courteous awesome place to hangout with friends it really fills not only your tummy but also you heart",5,
"it is hard to find places which give delivery upto morning 4am american wild wings is one of them it is just beside creamstone gachibowli they deliver chicken wingssaladpopcornfriesbiriyani and andhra style chicken from evening till morning  they have a decent seating arrangement too for chicken wings you got almost 1012 sauces to choose upon among them my favorite are texas bbq and mexican jerk also tried their strawberry mocktail which was refreshing their biriyani comes with drumsticks  wings tried the drumstick biriyani chicken were well spicy and well with curry leaves  andhra style serviceambience and prices all were decent nothing fancy to be expected
so if you are planning to have something beforig indulging urself in creamstone visit here

"american wild wings is an affordable version of bdubs mainly focused on wings fries and burgers with a touch of desi dishes as well

i was there with my wife for dinner and we had a delightful time as we both love chicken wings the various sauces on offer is amazing we tried pattaya thai texas bbq mexican jerk original hot and amazon wild i liked bbq and original hot both were exceptional we then moved on to chicken nuggets chicken fried burger and grilled chicken salad nuggets were amazing crispy and soft while burger and salad were delicious as well

we had this with a few soft drinks and mocktails namely lemonade and mango both were pretty good but can be improved

service was great we were very well taken care by mr srinivas the branch manager ambience is okay and needs to be worked upon a bit being an upcoming fastfood joint

overall an excellent place for chicken wing lovers and that too at a moderate price range",5,
"i absolutely love chicken wings so i had to try this new place in gachibowli as i have heard about it from a few friends

i have been to this place with a group of foodie friends
this is a small outlet located on the first floor right above dirty burgers
the place can host upto 30 pax max
the place was bright and colourful with good lights all over the place



food
we tried different sauces
the texas bbq spicy garlic pattaya thai original hot mexican jerk and amazon wild
all of the wings were delicious and had varying spiciness
the wings were slightly crispy outside and soft insidejust the way i like them to be

next we were served with chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn
the best munching dish i love till date are the chicken nuggets
they tasted really good and were tastier than expected
the nuggets were my favourite

the chicken popcorn was not that great
the presentation was not at all good and the chicken was very chewy
need to improve this

surprisingly the menu had biryani in it
we tried their wings dim biryani 
the biryani was not that proper hyderabadi biryani but had a good taste 
they served a really good quantity of biryani

the management has to improve in their food presentations
i personally liked this place and recommend everyone to do give it a try",4,
"american wild wings  amazing wings
i happened to visit this place yesterday for dinner well who does not like chicken wings i love wings so wanted to check out this place
it is a small cozy place giving cafe feels interiors are decent and so is the seating there are not any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly they have self service system
coming to food and menu
the menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste so it is value for money the only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes
taste quantity and price are all up to the mark
i tried their signature sauces for the mains texas bbq pattaya thai spicy garlic original hot mexican jerk and amazon wild to my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot loved them
tried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement
the menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani not the authentic one but related to their respective genre like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani the quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu it was the star of the evening though tatse texture everything was perfect
also had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour had fried chicken burger too which was tasty and ya tastier than the kfc burger
overall the place is affordable and nice the hospitality was very nice thanks mr srinivas you were always up your feet and served us well the staff is humble and friendly
recommended",4,
"a great hangout place for the it employees and with with really reasonable prices

peaceful ambience with no much of chaos in the place

order was taken as per our wishlist and made the items accordingly with the required spicyness and etc

we had chicken fry  chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn and then boneless chicken biryani which were served really very hot and tasty

overall a very comfortable place with affordable prices and quality food

would surely drop by sometime whenever possible ",5,
"american wild wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings located in gachibowli main road just beside creamstone it is a place to relish chicken wings

i tried out their chicken nuggets chicken salad chicken fried burger and various chicken wings the sauce i loved the most was bbq chicken wings chicken nuggets were amazing as well

we tried their lemonade and mango mojito they were okay but can be improved the service by mr srinivas is quick and he is very understanding ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance

this place is a must try for their wings and nuggets",5,
"rating  35

visited this place on a friday evening the interiors are okayish they need to work alot upon that

now coming to food

we tried their wings in 89 different sauces most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone

my personal favorite was mexican jerk barbeque and konaseema though the sauces can be reduced a little

also the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved the lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder

we also ordered virgin mojito which was very very sweet for our palate

the chicken caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces the chicken was very chewy

we also ordered chicken biryani and patiala chicken

the biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it meat was fresh and tender

patiala chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it

also the chicken popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement

the white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking

overall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced",4,
"american wild wings is another fast food joint located amidst the cream stone outlet of gachibowli the place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 2030 people went there with my friends to try out their food i found their ambiance quite ordinary and i felt it can get some makeover

starting with their appetizers we first tried out their in house chicken wings so the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types they offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic texas bbq pattaya thai spicy garlic amazon wild etc

my personal favorite of the lot had to be original hot chicken wings and mexican wild chicken wings the wings were super juicy and delicious however i also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect

next up we had their classic chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken the nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets the popcorn chicken was chewy it requires serious attention and changes

for mains the place has also introduced authentic indian dishes such as chicken biryani with salan raita and gongura chicken the gongura chicken was an absolute relish to my surprise the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the biryani

thanks for a wonderful time mr srinivas moreover this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their chicken wings anyday happy eating ",4,
"they say count your chicken before they hatch and this weekend i did almost that hehehe well we were counting them before having it 

our visit was an invite for a complimentary lunch by mr srinivas lanka incharge of the restaurant operations management and marketing this place on a main location of gachibowli hyderabad with a dinein they offer american cuisine for  chicken lovers and as the name suggests they specialise in chicken wings

we got some thirstquenching mojito mocktails lemonade orange and strawberry they also offer slushies but was not available at that time moving on as suggested we ordered the wings with 4 kinds of sauces pattaya thai spicy garlic texas bbq and mexican jerk  this one was my favourite they were slightly crispy on outside and juicy on the inside

pattaya thai spicy sauce with coarse texture
spicy garlic finely chopped garlic and chilli flakes sauce
texas bbq the same old barbecue sauce with sweet and savoury taste and a hit of chilli 
mexican jerk a sweet and spicy smooth textured sauce that won my   

we also ordered for popcorn chicken which was crispy fried but not very impressive original patty burger which was quite simple no veggies in it not even the basic ones like tomato onion rings or lettuce and was served pretty hot with french fries so be careful when you take a bite we also ordered for asian fried chicken salad but was served with caesar chicken salad  which was little disappointing to taste as well

you can definitely visit this place on fridays and saturdays for drinks liquor as well so here is my rating on this  

food 45 this is just for the chicken wings alone
service 355 little slow but courteous staff
ambience 35 nice and decent

overall i would like to rate it 385 as there is lot of scope for improvement in future

"hey reader
american wild wings is located in gachibowli  mallikarjuna towers adjacent to creamstone above dirty burgersthis place serves wild wings burgers combos  rice biryani and also kids snacks 
it has got a very simple ambience with spacious seating which consists of multiple tables with a busy road view 
the walls here are plastered with designer wall papers which adds life to this place 

food 
salad 
caesar salad  this was all with veggies especially cold lettuce  paneer pieces  and others
asian fried chicken salad  it was more of cabbage and fried chicken with fried bread pieces here and there

mojito
orange mojito this tasted bit soothing but was little too sweet  good one for summers to quench your thirst
lemonade  this was minty and cool 
strawberry mojito it tasted more like a strawberry

bean wings  these are the best anyone could have at this place  because the sauces are really apt for their names 
taxas bbq amazon wild  original hot really hot which burns your mouth  pattaya thai it was sweet  all these sauces and even other sauces taste so good with the chicken wings 

veg burger  pattie made with veg  layered the bun with cheese  veggies which tasted good 
mogli nuggets  these were the tiny nuggets which indeed tasted so good  best one to just munch on 


rice 
chicken fried rice  tasted strong yet was tasty
veg corn rice  it was assorted in veggies and the corn in it added more flavour to it
veg biryani  best one to have at this place  tasted mild  the rice was flavoured enough 

chicken biryani  good one to get parcel or even to have at this place  tasted quite good

"we happened to visit american wild wings on a friday evening and the place was desolated the place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept

we started with a lemon mojito though refreshing it was a tad too sweet for my liking we thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately our chicken ceasar salad was drenched in dressing it almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise

then came in an array of wings each with their own signature sauces we tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them all the wings were fried well and had a good crunch of all the sauces my top picks were there barbeque konaseema amd mexican jerk barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper coriander and coconut and the mexican jerk had a garlicky periperi kind of flavor must try sauces while these sauces were good few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing the lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate the original hot did not taste of anything but spice and bitterness they also have a sauce names atomic  the hottest on their menu it was indeed very hot for my liking we also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent chicken nuggets were good nothing out of the ordinary

though their usp is wings they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving biryanis fried rice and a few curries we tried their chicken frypiece biryani and it had a unique flavor the meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well chicken punjabi a sarson ka saag version was actually really good it had the perfect saag flavor again too oily

upon their suggestion we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn both of which were terrible the pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard stay away

another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes the first serving of our wings was dead cold when brought to their notice the second serving was mouthburning hot the biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl the bowl was so hot we could not even pick it to put the food in our plates

overall they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve the quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon they also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds price wise they are pretty pocket friendly

been there for a dinner had a great experience of tasting chicken wings ordered hulk wings so delicious hot served with mind blowing sauces like original hot  amazon wild  lemon pepper and pataya thai at a reasonable price their combos were really superb with unmatched quality of burgers and salads with refreshing lemonade and starwberry mojitos however suggest to  place different flavors of dips to be served with wings to make it more and more tasty,5,
"i was invited by mr srinivas the man in charge at aww for a tasting lunch session the food was complimentary from their side i had a nice afternoon there the restaurant is very well placed in gachibowli just near karachi bakery on old mumbai highway

the best part of the experience beside the wonderful time spent with mr srinivas was the food i tasted their chicken nuggets caesar salad different types of chicken wings and i took a parcel of grilled chicken burger with fries
 i really encourage everyone to try their wings i had texas bbq sauce parmesan and garlic mexican and lemon pepper sauce i thoroughly enjoyed every style the wings were juicy and tender yammm
 caesar salad was very nicely dressed nice chunks of chicken there and the croutons made the dish complete
 the burger was definitely above the average burgers you have in the city the burger patty was a real burger patty not some sweet bun
 nuggets were regular deep fried with mayo nothing special here just a decent starter
more of that i checked their menu and the prices are really reasonable

aside the good food there is some room for improvement the place should be better maintained at the entrance door there was a bit of mess and the cleanliness is not their strongest point the order and cash counter side looks more like a storage area with boxes and bags over there the tables floors and windows should be spotless because this restaurant really has potential and also i would suggest to have a better quality cutlery because the plastic fork given was horrible it bended every each time i tried to pick some food if they will focus a bit more on maintenance and details it can be a busy place because definitely the food is good

overall a reasonable priced restaurant with good food and some room for improvement in the ambiance area but definitely recommended for a least a try

"i have ordered chicken wings and french fries they are legit cold and quality of chicken is absymal also very poor packaging straight into bin 
wouldnt recommend",1,
i ordered french fries instead i received aloo bhartaa literally poor packaging quality all went to the   please improve your quality i wish i knew i would get such soggy not even 1 fried fries,1,
compared to buds we really found the best taste of wings and fires so good that we are getting food delivered deliciously we have found good packing and even burgers is taste is awsome,5,
american wild wings is a restaurant which serves us the better food with a good quality actually ii had ordered the wings they are awesome in taste but should be some what less juicy,5,
very nice place to visit with a good ambiance and the food is very tasty and the staff is also very much friendly and one more suggestion is to change the menu regularly,5,
"it is very rare that the food is so horrible that you have to leave it midway and post a review 

i ordered chicken burger  fries  wings  soft drink combo through zomato and received my order fairly quickly however
1 fries were totally cold and soggy 
2 burger was average  tasted like the lowend 40 rupees burger at mcdonalds
3 wings were either burnt or doublefried there were parts of the thick coating which were burnt black  and they perhaps tried to fix it by adding too much sauce on the top

looking at other reviews it feels like it might be onceinawhile exception but they ruined my monday lunch

wouldnt recommend",1,
"would rate this place 35
the food is good no doubt but they are not professional with the quantity i have ordered ceasar salad twice once the quantity was decent but the next time it was very less please take note before ordering food is good though",3,
"burger combos
ambiance
american wild wings is recently opened restaurant at indiranagar gachibowli they have a large indoor sitting area available and have beautiful lights counter is located at one of the sides of restaurant
food
american wild wings serves burgers chicken wings drumsticks chinese and combos they also serve food with variety of sauces like tandoori sauce chill garlic sauce etc we placed an order for grilled chicken burger fries chicken wings and coke combo burger was very tasty and loaded with cheese and grilled chicken we also placed an for chicken drumsticks which came into three large chicken leg pieces with chilly garlic sauce which was mouth watering
service
service was very quick and the staff was very good",3,
terrible wings not sure if this was just a one off or not but it was inedibly spicy good fries tho choice for sauces would probably be mich more helpful,1,
wings are of very good quality and variety and quality of sauces is very good just keep it up play some light music in the restaurant american theme,5,
i ordered bean wings but all i received was disappointment and bad taste undercooked wings the popcorns were like nuggets but decent each wing tasted different and bad,1,
"ordered ceaser salad it contained lettuce lettuce and more lettuce not to mention couple of tomato slices and some hard chicken meat ignore the sauces it was jus for smell sake  avoid salads from them ",2,
"what a taste it is   it is really american taste of burgers which we tasted in texas earlier we are amazed to see such a american taste really awesome burger and wings
hope i will visit again for same taste",5,
aa we are fond of tasty and healthy food once we have been to american wild wings we have got pretty good taste of biryani we have visited almost three time and bookt in online for our sources,5,

a very nice place to visit to have a super food the staff is also very much friendly we can not find any cons in these restaurant and also a nice place to visit with a family and with friends,5,
the wings were very bad in taste and please rather than packing the cold drinks its better to give cans the cold drink was not packed well and all the drink fell down fries were not well packed hope you guys look into the matters soon,1,
"it is really yummy the best ever burger with slight konaseema chicken taste

"delicious food with pleasant ambiance and good service
especially french fries and chicken popcorn are awesome and tastefull
chicken wings biriyani is delicious",5,
ordered chicken and rice combo the packing was horrible a portion of the coke dripped into the packet leading to make the whole thing sticky even the tissue papers were smeared with coke the rice tasted sour the drumstick smelt foul the only thing met expectations was the fries may be for the first time in my life i had to throw away half of my food would to look forward for the betterment of the quality and taste,2,
"food was good
place was nice
staff were polite
combos were best among the menu
choice of sauces met customer satisfaction with a couple of fries",4,
as it is name suggests the wings are mouth watering you can really enjoy the taste of tenderjuicy and freshly prepared chicken lots of varieties in sauces and different kinds of wings are always pushing me to order from this restaurantquantity of combos are huge i have heard ambience is too good i am looking forward to come for dine too,5,
packaging was really bad sauce was dripping from the packet also ordered sprite can and they delivered in a glass shouldnt like customer this way needs lot of improvement if they want to be in business for long,2,
"hello
i just ordered from your place on zomato i just do not want to comment on food that is up to your standards but the softdrink which you have sent is smelling like bathroom cleaner please let me know are you serving soft drinks or any harpicbathroom cleaner kind of thing",1,
"it is a great place to have food best quality with quantity the ambience is great the services are very fast each item has as great flavour and taste with each being different

thanks for that amazing food of yours and hope to visit it soon and i kindly recommend you to visit the place for having a great food",5,
food was really good but please mention properly about combo offers like burger with chicken wings was expecting a chicken burger other then tht every thing is fine,4,
i would rate it 25 i ordered the original patty burger and wings the burger was quite average or maybe even on the lower side the buns felt dry the patty was not anything special the fries that came with it were too salty the wings however were tasty45,3,
nice food good restaurant and compensate the value for money best north and south indian foods and effortabl prices rich look and maintenance,5,
"they served me burnt food and topped with sauce  it was all smelling burned and the decorated it and served  crazy ppl and on complaining zomato says they need to investigate  woah i would never order from this place and still there is no action taken on it ",1,
staff was polite and friendly but the food and the taste was below par the burgers were decent but their wings are baaaad at the time we went even the power was also not there,2,
"american wild wings as the name tells wings are too wild the blend of sauces to the chicken wings produce a complete new taste

ambience was good enough for families

service was good and polite",4,
i love how they treat the customers i think i will never taste the wings before the taste is really awesome i suggest to open one store in ameerpet too i recommend to have a fine dine in with your friends and family,5,
"a small cute place to visit simple decor love the lighting here the staff are really polite and helpful the service is quick
the menu is really good and pocket friendly it gives you a variety of options
we tried the chicken original patty burger chicken wings in bbq sauce fried chicken burger chicken wings french fries curly fries and coke the quantity and quality are both worth the money
loved the curly fries they were crispy and very tasty must try",4,
loved the wings great environment with great taste best serve wings biryani tastes excellent  i recommend to go with your friends and have a great meal,5,
"i ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato which is 1xfrench fries 6x chicken wings and one coke350ml
quantity was satisfactory
packaging of the food was good i really liked how they packaged the coke which was still a bit cold when it arrived some may call it excessive packaging however
the fries were warm and well salted but they were not crispy this could be the fault of delivery so i am not upset only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently
the wings were covered in brown gravy i was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph while the wings were certainly not bad i did not enjoy it very much
i would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself",4,
"i had wings with mexican jerkit tastes deliciousquantity is more and food is awesome
quantity 55
food55
will visit restaurant soon as the ambience looks very good in the photos",5,
"i have ordered from dominos all my life but no store has ever been this bad
the order arrived in 45 mins all my food had completely cooled down
i asked the delivery boy about their 30 mins policy and he gave a very casual answer saying maam parking me late hogya jaane do i tried to argue saying that its not my problem and he agreed to give me a 300 rs refund i asked him to do it at the moment and he said his manager is busy so it cant be done right now but he assured me that it will be done 

i talked to his manager on the phone and he completely denied my refund 
he did not care about customer service he talked very rudely and he said he is not going to follow the policy he also said i do not care if you accept the order or return it
if this was the case why did the delivery boy ensure my refund and tried to run off

people like this do not deserve to be a part of dominos
they are completely ruining the franchise image",1,
pathetic service  food arrived in 2 hours cold and no apology from the restaurant  very bad customer care service from zomato and dominoes,1,
worst experience at dominos no air conditioner at the store is working out of 5 it was too hot no one cared about it it took too long to get the tables cleaned,1,
i ordered pizza with extra cheese but there is no extra cheese in it i cant imagine dominos can do such a pathetic job i am totally dissatisfied,1,
"domino is does not live up to the standards any more i ordered a pizza and it was late with a delivery time of 1hour with a promised delivery of 30 mins once i got the pizza it was smashed when asked for a refund they said they will give me domino is credits however i did not get the credits as well also i do not want domino is credits i want my money back i will never order from dominos again and would advise that they shut down at least this store since they are not able to live up to the standards
attached images of the smashed pizza",1,
very worst taste i have ever had in my life even compared to others like ks bakers karachi bakery pizza are better than this do not want to refer,1,
i ordered 2 pizza from here via zomato first of all i got my order after 1 and half hour and worst thing is i got the pizza which i have not ordered it was not expected from the dominos,1,
the order delivered was not so satisfying because the pizza was not enough hot to catch up the taste of it hope i get it right next time when i order,3,
"pathetic experience
never order from this outlet
they neither deliver the order nor refund your money
i ordered at around 9pm from this outlet and waited till 11 i never received my food
also all the help line numbers they provide are either wrong or not reachable
highly disappointed",1,
garlic bread was half cooked,2,
"ordered a pizza garlic bread and other stuff on 14th feb at 9 pm through zomato zomato shows order is in the kitchen but no call no delivery even by 1015 pm the branch number on zomato was incorrect called up dominos hotline and they said they will reach out to the branch and they will call back waited for 15 min no call back called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch 5 min later i am disconnected called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money

i anyway do not eat dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience but ordered on my wife is insistence congratulations now even my wife does not want to order dominos ever again 

1 zomato does not have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order the system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order

2 dominos hotline is worthless no clue on if their branch actually has a working phone or not",1,
all time favourite my favourite is pepper barbecue and stuffed garlic bread high quality with reasonable prices no other pizza can dominate domino is pizza,5,
it is waste to order pizza from this restaurant i forgot that i have preferred a cheese burst pizza there is no cheese in pizza and moreover the diameter of uttappam is far better than this pizza i will never prefer this,1,
taste is good,5,
the pizza if eaten at the restaurant is very good home delivered pizza are somehow tasting pale otherwise the pizza is the best out of all the pizzas i have had lately,4,
as always tasty and excellent,5,
according to the message i got from dominos  the delivery executive was supposed to deliver the pizza at the door despite of me mentioning the complete address the man came at the wrong place and called me outside they should never mention door delivery if they wanna deliver it outside,3,
i am still waiting for the pizza,1,
the pizzas were delivered to me after 2 hours of placing the order and they were cold inspite of raising a complain 34 times i did not receive any customer support and was not even contacted by their supervisor needless to say i was not even reimbursed for the late delivery and cold pizzas,1,
i had been waiting 1 hour 26 min to receive my order and i did not get any information from zomato as well as dominos the contact numbers that mentioned in the message did not work at all finally i got a call from delivery guy after 1 hour and he said will be there in 3 min but still waited 26 min infront of my gate to see the delivery guy the worst thing was i could not eat that pizza since it was harder than the packing box,1,
good and polite,5,
less cheese in cheese burst,2,
the delivery was faster than expected i could not believe i got a call just 5 minutes after i placed the order and the guy was at the doorstep,5,
"on time delivery and great pizzas thanks zomato ",5,
in short it was pathetic they will mark the order as delivered from there side only  though it will never get delivered to you not the first time and there contact is always find not reachable and it seems they have open an outlet under water or inside an elevator,1,
"great service quick delivery

"best shawarma served at reasonable price and the mayonnaise is simply awesomerumali shawarma withwithout salad is the best one till date ",4,
"waste restaurant
i ordered special chicken shawarma but there is no cheese  getting rotten smell in it it has happened several times even zomato people unable to help out ",1,
"till now this is the worst shawarma what i tasted
very very bad taste and worst
very dry and oily this is the best in bad taste quality of a chicken is also very bad",1,
"worst shawarma i have ever tasted

i believe they are providing 23 days old shawarmas

iam saying this because when i have ordered here i got a shawarma with soaring smell even chicken was smelling",1,
strong recommendation never ever order from here  it was the worst experience i had attempted by ordering from here i order special chicken shwarma the chicken was spoiled and smelling badly and by having one bite i thrown to garbage bin,1,
plz dont buy this shawarma very cheap quality of food items they used and not fresh if ther is negative maarking i will give them 10000 and very cheap paking,1,
"these guys used to be really good at making delicious falafel and regular shawarma over the time the quality seems to have dropped to an extent that the food smells bad and makes you feel sick

the wrapping paper which they use to wrap these things in sometimes sticks to your food if i were you i wouldnt eat here save your money and skip this place",1,
horrible i ordered 1 special and 2 regular shawarma we got 3 regular shawarma pathetic experience i am satisfied with the person who delivered please let him have the credit for the delivery,1,
i ordered 2 shawarmas but the food was spoiled they gave old stock it was very hard the rumali rotti was sticky my stomach felt uncomfortable i vomitted i do not trust this shop anymore they are cheating the customers why do we pay money is this how they gibe offers and all online buyers are not dumbyards,1,
this is my nth experience ordering the shawarma for a quick bite they are good with quality and taste of the food and i really liked the quick service of this restaurant late at night and even on weekends,5,
worst shawarma ever ordered three times from here and every single time i got yukkiest shawarma ever no mayonnaise chicken smelling like hell and uncooked rumali roti never going to eat at this place,1,
please do not order from this outlet they are delivering late and the taste is not at all goodi just ordered one chicken shawarma they delivered it late and the food is spoiled less chicken more creames and salad not even worth of rs10,1,
"unprofessional and unhygienic shawarma fast food shops have sprang up in every nook and corner of the city but they typically have their setup on roads hygiene is never considered

ordered rumali roti shawarma the bread was half cooked i will avoid this place in future",2,
"i ordered a cheese falafel wrap the wrap had no cheese the falafel was deep fried in oil that was quite old and i could taste it in every bite which made it quite bad apart from that quantity wise it was quite good but tbh quality matters too

would i order again not really",2,
i like this place for the mayonnaise they provide it is really tasty and thick the chicken with salad shawarma is good here though they can try making the rumali roti little more softer,3,
i have ordered shawarmas from this outlet more than a couple of times but today the shawarma which was delivered was very bad  the rumali wrap was hard and the filling had next to no chicken never ever going to order from here again,2,
shawarma is too small,3,
they have mentioned as special chicken shawarma but nothing special in it and surprisingly no chicken in chicken shawarma quantity is also very less do not prefer this place for chicken shawarma it is waste of money to order from this place,1,
bad taste,3,
very poor quality food avoid this restaurant to save your money ordered special chicken shawarma and something arrived like a wrapsandwitch which was even sour in taste ie it was storedrotten,1,
"the place is more a storage room than a shawarma outlet
does not uphold the mohammedia standard
the vegetables in the salad are not fresh and the shawarma is packed sparingly with way too much mayo
supervise your shawarma if visiting",1,
please be advised of the tasteless crap load sold as shawarma filled with vegetable and nothing but tons of vegetables to make sure you will not complain perfect for one on diet or a vegetarian as they do not use much chicken its just roti filled with cucumber and tomato kudos to the chef,1,
i would say it was one of the best shawarma that i have had till date thanks would definitely order again from this place,5,
sorry to say but got rotten tomato and cucumber in salad with rotten chicken was smelling very bad could not eat it waste of money and time,1,
in the previous order chicken shawarma was good but now its horrible mixup it was coming bad smell and chiekcn is getting very worst,1,
food taste was average,3,
no chicken in shawarma only cabbage and tomatowaste of moneyworst shawarmabefore one month shawarma is good now a days waste shawarma,1,
no chicken in chicken shawarma total waste of money worthless,1,
"shawarma tasted so bad and it is not worth the money
it was delivered quickly so i guess haste makes waste
so i guess now i reached the word count",1,
this place serves you one of the worst shawarma in hyderabad neither the chicken is properly roasted nor the roti is properly made one of the worst i have had,1,
i saw a rat roaming around in the outlet i pointed this out to owner and he gave an unaffected expression avoid ordering food from this outlet,1,
"they cancelled my order after 30 mins of payment what kind of bullshit is this i am leaving zomato for sure i am shifting to other apps

very bad service by zomato they do not even have courtesy

this is by far the worst service by any service provider by all means

i have the entire conversation on phone recorded with their support team will give it in fb and fb pages",1,
i just ordered a chicken shawerma  is this what you people call a shawerma it was veg or non veg do you atleast know it it was full of cabbage and nothing else the most horrible  shawerma i ever had i jst threw them in garbage simply its the worst sharwarma i have ever ate do you thik it was a eatable   paid full payment but i am not satisified with the shawarma it was a complete waste of money frust n never going to be order anything from ur is mohammedia shawarma   so please waste our money and time   1 rating is also waste for it,1,
taste should improve as it was not good in taste also everytime i order from here they do not give tomato ketchupthere was an instance happend last time when i ordered they did not gave me extra mayo which i ordered,2,
"i asked for ketchup the packet is empty
i asked for mayonnaise it was not in packet",1,
not as expected,3,
the quantity has been decreased very much we ordered shawarma with extra mayyonise bowl but was not delivered and amount was paid how to react on this  this was not expected from mohammedia shawarma we were not at all happy with this,1,
worst shawarma it is totally waste of money i have never eaten such a worst shawarma and these people are totally fraudi dont know how these people call this as shawarmathe worst thing i have ever aten,1,
below average taste,2,

"yesterday we went to this place

service is very very slow even on a weekday it took so much time for kababs to come

often they say if you arrive late make it grand we hoped the food will be awesome as they might took so much time to prepare it but alas the food is disgusting

not recommended at all go only if you are getting offer like more than 60 off otherwise complete waste of money",1,
"today went to this place i will be brutality true there is a reason why they are giving huge discounts via different bookingtable reservation platforms

service  very very slow even on a weekday seems kitchen is highly understaffed

food pathetic i am living in hyderabad for last 10 years i have not had so pathetic kababs here in hyderabad like what i got at arena eleven

overall a big no please do not waste your money here

1 ordered fish lemon pepper kabab it was too salty

2 ordered chicken tikka kabab you can not even chew the chickn pieces it was so hard  tasteless

3 ordered a mocktail for my wife it was full of water instead",1,
the food here was ok but the service was worst ever if you have 34hrs free time to spend then come here the service is slow as sloth we ordered starters got it after 30min then got lunch after an hour i guess they forget orders after you give them you have to remind them atleast twice or thrice to get it,2,
"arena eleven
this place is all about kebabs beer and sports
located in sln terminus mall
this place has both indoor and outdoor seating
outdoor view is beautiful
and they have around 10 screens
after all this place is about sports


they are serving buffet and alacarte
and they are running 50 off during day time
in food we have tried
chicken kebab platter  12 kebabs and priced at 540 is very economical
and tasted quite good

veg primevara pizza  lots of veggies topped on thin base loaded with cheese
tasted great

veg sheek kebab  
has to be fried properly

honey chilli chicken wings  spicy but not so sweet
served hot 

sizzling chicken tikka biryani  had no expectations on biryani here but it turned out good
and chicken tikka pieces were soft


in mocktails we tried
fruit sangria and mango margarita
fruit sangria is made of cranberry juice and oranges  green apple
mango margarita is the best mango mocktail we ever had
a must try here

in cocktails peach martini was good",4,
"arena eleven sports bar

ipl is here and whats better way to enjoy it than watching it in a sports bar there are not many sports bar around and arena eleven is the swankiest ones in town located in the snl terminal  this is the best destination if you are a sports fan

ambience 45 the seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner they have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place beautifully designed restro arena eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food they have some good tracks playing which i liked as wellthey have indoor as well as outdoor seatingoutdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city

food and beverages  45 

you can opt for either ala carte or buffetthe place has both options

mocktails and cocktails  in mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried this had grape juice  with fresh apple and bartenders mix then we tried mint julep which was fresh otange wedges with mintlime and orange juice it was decentzen zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks brown sugar ginger and fresh mint topped with cola it was nothing special and was too sweetvirgin mojito was as it should be

in cocktails we tried old fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters this one was a little too concentrated and strong for menext we had kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and cinnamon it was a delightfull drinkthen was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix this drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste

food

1 veg manchaow soup  the soup did not appeal my pallate  it was moreovee tasting like rasam than a chinese soup

2 tandoor items  we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good

3 tandoori non veg sizzler  this was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka  fish tikka it was absolutely delighfull

4tandoori veg sizzler  this had paneer tikkaveg seekh kababthe veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour

5 hot wings  the hot wings were sweet to taste where as as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy this was a disappointing one

6tandoori chicken tandri  tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices

7 masala fries  this is a very new concept which i tried for the first time the masala fries were served with chopped onionsit was really good and we could not stop at one or two

8chilli fish  chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style

8 chicken tikka pizza  chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings this was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce the crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked

9 chicken seekh kabab  i absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through

10 veg seekh kabab  the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavourscould be better

11 chicken green curry and steamed rice  the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes the consistency was also creamy the taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour

12 chicken tikka biryani  from the buffet  absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning the hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall

desserts

1 gajar ka halwa  i absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along it felt divine

2 kheer  the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste

the place is really nominal with good food with this rate charged and the sports add on it providesthis place is absolutely recommended",4,

"was here few days back the place was so busy and full had to wait a few minutes to get a table

staff were friendly and patient got a table we requested

coming to the food ordered chicken nasheman tikka stuffed tangdi kebab and fish tikka for starters all tasted good tried pina colada mocktail which was fine but do not go with spicy foodfor maindish we were suggested to take sizzling chicken tikka biryani and was tatsy as suggested
ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating

"arena eleven an sports bar with the theme menu of kebabs and beer with live screening of sports every day located in the sln terminus mall in level 3 cozy ambience well set up of giant screens and led screens all over the restaurant as you cannot miss any single action of your sorts while eating the delicious kebabs and sizzlers a pocket friendly restaurant with awesome food menu

i have been there on multiple times once with a friend and also by a invite both of my experiences are much better then the before one

my favorites at arena eleven are the kebab sizzling platters the assorted sizzling platters are so succulent and tasty with the hot sizzle

i love the chicken pizza the thin crust and the toppings are really good

thai green curry with steam rice are one of my favorite but just they need to be little consistent

chicken tikka biryani is the usp of arena eleven menu it is really too good in taste and the quality

i had the best non alcoholic sangria here it was the best so far must try this

arena eleven has very good and economical lunch buffet the spread is much worth at price of rs 550

rice kheer is my favorite in desserts",5,
"visited arena 11 for a sunday branch it was easter sunday and the place was packed also since the ipl season is on this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list

the have sunday buffet brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious though the presentation can be improved alot

we also tasted their ala carte menu a few of the items were good but their is not much consistency with their dishes

at once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par

lemon pepper fish tikka honey chilli chicken wings and tangri kebab were served

the lemon fish tikka and tangdi kebab were good but honey chilli chicken wings were too sweet for my palate

the sizzling veg tikka platter and masala fries were good

in buffet the chicken curry and murg makhani stood out

also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great

i suggest them to add some more variety for desserts",3,
"arena eleven is a sports bar located at the plush and financial province of hitec city there is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor the menu is extensive there is plenty of waitstaff our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to

"it is during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town but not to worry as arena eleven is here to woo the same crowd with their delightful sportsthemed decor offering bigscreen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience located at level 4 of sln terminus mall in gachibowli the tagline for the place is kebabs beers  sports each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly

the menu for the place is particularly compact serving only a selective few indian and oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the ala carte section we ended up calling for their sizzling veg tikka platter and masala fries both of which turned out to be pretty good the platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice namely veg shami peri peri and lemon pepper paneer tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base veg shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture masala fries was just a indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks

non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the tangri kebab lemon pepper fish tikka and honey chili chicken wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind my personal favourite was their lemon pepper fish however for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination honey chili wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers disappointing was their chili fish however which had no flavour whatsoever  bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning the kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper

running a buffet on weekends the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of indian options to choose from each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice where the non vegetarian sect had chicken curry and murg makhani along with some delectable chicken tikka biryani after the disappointment in the starters it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were chicken curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added going absolutely well with some hot tandoori rotis same was the case with murg makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste trying out their chicken tikka pizza from the ala carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale which definitely did not justify the price tag for the same the dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the gajar ka halwa and rice kheer both of which were plain simple average

the service too was not any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well the kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace they almost always lacked consistency the dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate all in all if the place provides a runofthemill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely

"arena eleven nestled in sln terminus gachibowli is a sportsthemed bar and restaurant with live screenings all around with two large screens and three televisions no matter where your table is you will be able to catch all the sporting action during the day the clarity of the large screens is lower because of the bright light from the glass panes the best part of the outdoor seating section is that it is located just beside the botanical garden with a sumptuous view of the green cover perfect to enjoy the cool breeze watch a match and hang out with friends 
 the bar menu offers an extensive range of classic cocktails with a good variety of imported spirits and liqueur they serve a widespread buffet with an array of mains the starters will be served to the table
in the starters we tried the sizzling tikka platter which consists of chicken tandoori lemon pepper chicken tangdi chicken paneer tikka veg seekh kabab and fish tikka tangdi chicken made a perfect starter soft and succulent chicken legs coated with a host of spices and grilled to perfection fish tikka was melting in the mouth with good flavors in veg do not miss out in paneer tikka it was so soft and properly cooked with the right amount of spices infused veg seekh kebab was good when we had it for the first time but when ordered for the next time it was very dry
apart from the tikka platter we tried chicken 65 honey chili wings salt and pepper prawns chili fish and masala fries i loved all of them

in the main course from the buffet they have two nonveg curries and two veg curries and assorted bread curries tasted delightful with rich gravy and spices on point ordered and tried their thai veg curry which disappointed me as it was too sweet chicken tikka biryani is a hit it was as tasty as it looks it was very different from the regular hyderabadi biryani yet very delicious 
tried the butter chicken masala pizza though the toppings were great the prebaked base which they used dropped the taste

from desserts they have gajar halwa and rice kheer tasted okish  not so great

drinks need some improvements as some are very sweet

if improved on the glitches in the food and drinks its a great place to eat drink socialize and watch your favourite sports live",4,
"rating 35

replacing serafina arena eleven is a new addition to the sln terminus mall with tv screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia the place is a crowdpuller during this ipl season the place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden

our sunday lunch started with a few drinks mint julep virgin mojito virgin sangria virgin pina colada zen zero  a mojito like drink with cola calvados  their version of a hot toddy old fashioned and kentucky apple cinnamon though the cocktails were potent they lacked finesse mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down the better ones of the lot were calvados apple cinnamon and mint julep

in the starters we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken lemon pepper malai nasheman paneer and fish tikkas the stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas we also tried their tangdi kebab salt and pepper prawns chili fish salt and pepper wings chicken 65 honey chili wings chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce masala fries chicken and veg sheek kebabs one thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more the second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless the tangdi kebab was well made soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor the chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious

i visited this place twice during the first visit i tried the chicken peri peri tikka roll chicken rajiala onion kulcha and thai green chicken curry for mains the roll was passable we were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it did not really prove to be it tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry nothing special the thai green chicken curry blew us off with it is flavors each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together it was magic pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons during the second visit we chose to eat the mains from their sunday buffet and it was not a great decision except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani the rest were tasteless we also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a premade base and tasted substandard we ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet

they only had a couple of desserts in both instances  gajar halwa and rice kheer they were just runofthemill kind and did not have any oomph factor

overall one thing that the place needs is consistency their tag reads kebabs beer sports but the kebabs part is not really justified service is decent they need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace they have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset

"arena eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city located inside the sln terminus it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby it hubs

i went over there to try out their weekend buffet first things first their buffet layout was well spread the starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from the drinks offered by them included mojito zen zero and mint julep the drinks were average and needs quite improvement

speaking about their starters i had their chicken tangdi malai paneer tikka salt and pepper prawns lemon pepper chicken tikka mutton seekh kebab and veg seekh kebab

amongst all the starters i loved their chicken tangdi kebab the chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection the use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat next up i also liked their lemon pepper chicken tikka it had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper

for mains the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes two veg main course dishes accompanied by dal assorted breads biryani and salads the chicken dishes were chicken curry and chicken tikka masala i found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken for veg their was mutter paneer and paneer butter masala i liked their mutter paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor

their biryani was a slight disappointment for me it could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken did not really serve justice to the dish apart from this i also had my hands on their veg thai curry it was served with steamed rice to be honest the preparation of thai green curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version maybe they can work upon the use of cocunut cream in the curry

for desserts i had their gajar ka halwa kheer and ice cream the desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together

all in all the place has got a huge potential all they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items happy eating ",4,
"it looks like a sports bar with proper setup but the people around did not seem to be sportive especially on a friday night p service was a bit on the slower side ambiance was good now coming to the main part the food

sizzling nonveg tikka platter with 3 tikkas of your choice
jamaica chicken tikka  the best of the lot and a must try
nasheman chicken tikka  not so appealing but ok ok types taste
malai fish tikka  soft and tasty
bhuna chicken  one of the best i have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious so this is a must try
chicken rajiala  a green gravy with boneless chicken not so tasty
chicken hakka noodles  it was too good especially for chinese lovers
sizzling chicken tikka biryani  look wise it was actually sizzling but not so much taste wise chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked
ginger coke  please do not try this one as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink

overall was a good experience",3,

other than beer i have tried their lit and a classic martini
they have got quite a nice ambience for a sports bar

i have tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu
as per the guy who served us jamaican and nasheman was their speciality
so we ordered that platter with jamaican nasheman and malai fish tikka
jamaican 45 more of a spicy tandoor
nasheman35 lame and tasteless

"i visited this place with my wife on 16 march2019  its located in sln terminus we were looking for a place to dine after our movie at platinum and we decided to give this place a try was it worth it lets find out

ambiance

we entered this place around 10 pm on a saturday night and this place was  literally bustling with crowd they have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge and all of them played sports channel ranging from cricket to premier league football we were promptly seated at the verandah the view from there is quite something we got seated in a semi lit corner the place has a cozy feeling and good vibes liked it ratings  45

service

pathetic needs a lot of improvement they took some time to produce the menu and then the waiter just did not show up for the order for next 15 minutes atleast we ordered food and drinks the food was delayed and drinks just didt come we had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks atleast so that we can end our boredom luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served when asked for the bill they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier saying printer was faulty phew ratings  15

food

did food proved to be the savior for the night read on  we ordered a cranberry breezer virgin mojito and couple of pinacoladasyes we took advantage of gold membership the virgin mojito was pathetic period  the pinacoladas were really good we ordered for sizzling veg tikka platter which was strictly okay  well the service and food really disappointed ratings  35

value for money

we shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks that too have taken the gold membership advantage high pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand so no way its vfm ratings  155

let is calculate

rating  ambiance  service  food  vfm4  2375

final thoughts

this place has all the potential to be nice a sports bar and i feel that their service and food really needs improvement",2,
"experience at arena eleven since it is in sln terminus mall it is not very difficult to find it was a friday when we had dinner here and the experience it was not the best although it could be place was packed by 9930 pm definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better one big minus point is that on a friday evening the washroom was out of order and i had to cross all sln third floor to get to the toilet ups that is really bad

ambiance is vibrant atmosphere is good but the music is too loud usually i do not mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation they have screens and it is a good place to watch some sports there is some kind of terrace too and that is good till the hot summer

service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen they also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order werent available like burgers pizza etc on a friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered

when it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average we had sizzling kebab platter chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose awesome kebabs really juicy and tasty every each one of them we had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious they did not give any mirch ka salaan raitha or onion with the biryani just plain but i asked for some raitha and they brought rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces the let down were the rolls we had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges maximum average on quality and taste
the price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try at least for the kebabs

one of the worst experience i had staff is not trained well and manager onsite is not at all worried for customer experience even though i booked a table i was not provided one service guys are not bothered to ask if customer needs anything even if restaurant was not full one of my ordered food was not even provided and what was provided that was stale and when asked manager was very rude with his replies i left the restaurant in the middle as except bira beer everything was pathetic even in last management guy declined to provide me the bill and was very very rude waited for around 15 minutes after paying the amount just to get the bill avishek and ajit were the two guys handling the overall management the day i went hope you guys have improved now and not giving same experience to others,1,
best place nice ambiance staff so humble specially abhisek and nice best place to hang out with at the week end must visit lots of verifies in cocktails,5,
"went for lunch buffet
ambience was good with very nice choice of music night view would be very nice
choice of starters was limited but the taste was good chicken kebab with a tinge of lemon was the best however fish was undercooked
surprisingly main course was quiet tasty with chicken tikka masala being the best
on the dessert side kheer was a spot on
at the end i would like to tell the worst part of my experience which was the service an utter dissapointment
the waiter is arguing behaviour and careless service ruined my mood i would ask the owner to please teach some basic behaviour to this waiter i dont know his name but i think he is just ruining his fellowmates career as well
because the food n ambience was good overall i would rate this 425",4,
"paneer kebab was yummy
tofu curry was ok
naans were lip smacking
food910
ambiance was good can rate 810
service was too late i rate 510",4,
"was quite skeptical about arena eleven the place being a newbie
chose this over some top restaurants at sln terminus and i must say i was not disappointed

the buffet has a simple menu with nearly 20 items food tasted decent but the desserts should be improved by miles as they create final impressions in any buffet

ambiance is quite good with indoor and outdoor seating the place was fully packed on a weekday afternoon
it has 2 screens and 5 tvs for sports viewing 

service could have been better the staff seemed quite confused and unresponsive sometimes

the buffet offers great value only if you use the offers on dineout

overall a good place for hanging out during cricket and football matches cause of the ambiance the food is good as well we had the kebab platter which was delicious the masala french fries were hot and crispy the egg noodles were a good option for the main course the chicken tikka biryani was disappointing though the air conditioner was not open at 4 30 in the afternoon which made it a humid experience,3,
"visited here during dine out offer period

ambiance the ambiance here is nice and pleasant the restaurant is a sports themed restaurant with live screenings of match there is an outside sitting area as well with the pleasant view of the botanical gardens t

food 

soup chicken hot and spicy soup i have to admit that this is one the items that i loved the most of this place there is no shortage of chicken pieces in the soup unlike other outlets and the soup is also a perfect combination of spiciness and sourness

starters honey baby corn chicken tikka paneer fry fish
a

 dessert loved the gajar ka halwa and it was melting in mouth with the perfect sweet taste garnished with cashew nuts
ice cream was another item",4,
we just had a lunch buffet  awesome food and friendly staff we like baby corn  fish tikka  tangdi kebaband gajar ka halwa great hospitality definitely we will visit again thank you so much,5,

"so it is our first time in hyderabad and we thought of having a great meal at radisson we visited cascade and much to our disappointment we found the food not even close to being great the vegetarian spread was very less with just 4 starters and that too of similar type non vegetarian variety was better than vegetarian but was also not up to the mark thought of making peace with the situation by hoping that the desserts would at least be nice but they too werent nice
one of the worst experiences of all times
to top it all the air conditioner was not working  definitely not going to visit again",1,
"went there for dinner in the weekend and had a very good experience their focus on customer service is highly commendable they made sure we were comfortably seated and also made separate seating arrangement for our 1 year old child

"i had the opportunity to be at cascade for 4 days and i must say the food served here was of top quality and the service rendered by the staff members was very courteous and on time 

on the fourth day i noticed that naan was not available at the counter but when i enquired it they immediately arranged it at my seat promptly 

chef tarunima was checking with all the customers and educating them on the availability of live counters

"sunday brunch experience at cascaderadisson it was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated i will describe in the review

service was really good one of the best mr salim and staff really did a great job to host us plus point for them

ambiance instead was a total let down at least for us floor was dirty as you can see in some pics chairs were dirty even the water bottle was dirty the restaurant itself has nothing special no atmosphere just bland if you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a no no

food was on the good side it had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou starters were average as desserts the best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles all other items are usually like everywhere salad counter pizza and pasta counter etc with some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste

when it comes to the price for the buffet i think is too expensive most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it

thank you so much abhinav you made my day",5,
"one of the most pathetic and tasteless food i ever had this 1 rating is also only because of ambience remaining things just shit i went for buffet here having lots and lots of expectations but all waste i didnot understand still what cuisines or what food they are trying to serve  first of all  all the menu in the buffet were cold i felt like i am eating a day before is food not at all fresh you will find lots and lots of varities in buffet but when it comes to taste disappointed it was completely waste of money services and hospitality was somewhat good but i am not at all happy with this place to the management here is request please change your menu and the way you cook there are many other places which serves far better food i cannt even think to visit this place again

as for the restaurant staff i have to say that pranika was very very polite and she gave me a good feeling anything i wanted she helped me with it i can say that by far she made me feel at home the only thing that was a little bit frustratingwas the fact that the wifi was not working properly everywhere in the hotel maybe a little thing for the hotel management to work on

"we went for the buffet lunch at radisson after a few years the overall experience was very average there were events going on and the place was overcrowded very few staff to helpassist
coming to food some items on the buffet were decent the basics liike paneer curry lacha paratha etc were good
salads and chaats were ok
desserts were below average
the one thing that is usually safe is a pizza they had pasta and pizzas as part of the buffet unfortunately they could not get the pizza to taste decent i had to leave pizza and eat something else which i never do
poor experience overall and unlikely to return again",3,
"been here for a breakfast buffet they have a widespread of north indian and south indian varieties

everything on the spread tasted good 4 varieties of fresh juices are served

worth the amount paid i must say",5,
15days of stay in radisson was so interesting just because of the service what i had from cascade staff parnika ajay vilas chief namru and all the other staff really appreciating for there work dedcation they gave same response from first day to our last day of stay i have been to many other hotels and restaurants but cascade staff rocks keep up the good work guyz all the best for your future keep rocking,5,

"this seemed to me as mainly buffet focussed  breakfast lunch and dinner  staying guests being the main clientele i have had a few meals here and could not complain standard fare with many options laid out which probably will not wow you but you will find a few things that you will like

their service is really good and i find the ambience very relaxed the a la carte section is quite limited and basic but they do make a pretty mean grilled fish dish",3,
"i was staying at the hotel radisson and so got a complimentary buffet breakfast along with my stay this review is about that experience

i went there along with a friend and it proved very tough to find an empty table as the place was crowded with guests after a wait of 10 minutes we found our table

first impressions about the buffet was that the spread was huge and also contained many live counters it had a nice mix of south indian north indian and continental dishes

i tried many of their dishes but the items i liked the most here are palak idly cheese omelette chicken sausages fresh grape juice white chocolate berliner and black currant yogurt

"cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious carlson group of hotels and offers multicuisine dishes

the tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical an addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies cascade is in gachibowli main road

it is located on the second floor of the property while the lobby is inviting it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby as you enter cascade you are greeted by a buddha statue

as soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side we had a few veg and non veg salad sausage with spinach started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems it was reused the chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself

actually none of the salads were any good partly because they werent fresh  something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad  freshness

starters  we had veg and nonveg soups lots of breads  naan roti kulchas veg starters included paneer tikka potatoes veg mix fried nonveg included couple of chicken items and fish they had little variety of but not so tasty starters

anyway rushed towards main course dal makhani which was waste or in another word i was searching for dal makhani flavor and i feel in this level of restaurant at least dal makhani should be right

moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with mutton curry i must appreciate mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better

for desserts it is a good mix of indian including hyderabadi bestseller double ka meetha and european delicacies

i am not much of a dessert being but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet

overall i will not call it astonishing stuff but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot",3,
went there for a dinner buffet highly disappointing firstly they quoted wrong price over the call on top of it there were very limited items in the buffet the ones that were there were mediocre as well we felt a road side dhaba would have been better,2,
"the largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in hyderabad i was surprised by the choices on offer spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast
 cereals breads pastries
 eggs grilled vegetables breakfast smoothies sausages
idli dosasuthappa vada with different condiments
 chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
 poori with bhaji and pav chicken kheema
 cheese and cold cuts
 fresh fruits
i have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more

service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever the food also tasted pretty good i will not hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends loved it",5,
"been there for team lunchi had expected a lil
more from this restaurant but it wasnt upto itthey had lil vareity of not so tasty startersmain course was better thoughthey had good vareity of sweets fr sureoverall it was good but can inprove over the taste",3,
was here with the office team for buffet dinner and drinks and could not find much varieties on table 4 points for taste 45 for service and 2 points for their dismal amount of variety you do not get much brand choice in drinks either,3,
good food and great service they are consistent in their food offering with polite service and the breakfasts are quite busy here on weekdays keep up the efforts,4.5,
"date  14feb2018 930 am 

was staying at this hotel so had breakfast at this diner a decent place  usual breakfast buffet that you find in such a place the service is good but food and ambience is average the good part is that the place is spacious",3,
"we came here for a buffet dinner over the weekend and it was a blast

ambiance well it is radisson so the place looks amazing and one side has huge windows that overlook the gachibowli road on the opposite is a nice glass wall with water running over it the spread is at the end with the soups on one side veg and nonveg starters on one side and main course on the other side live chat breads and icecream counters on the side there are beautiful chandeliers and the lighting the place looks really good

food first of all the spread was amazing we had veg and nonveg soups lots of breads  naan roti kulchas veg starters included paneer tikka potatoes veg mix fried nonveg included couple of chicken items and fish the fish was really good and i enjoyed the chicken starters especially the peri peri chicken 

in main course we had lamb stew jamaican jerk chicken kung pao fish and another fish item with coconut rice steamed rice noodles with veg and nonveg biryani for vegetarians we had paneer tikka masala dal baked veggies and few other options the best item was the jerk chicken followed by the kung pao i also tried the samosa chat which was quite good

finally came the desserts there were cakes halwa macaroons and various other items the macaroons were the best followed by the cheese cake

all in all a very nice meal with a lot of options and great service",4,
"exquisite buffet breakfast spread covering south indian north indian a bit of american and italian cuisine with gouda cheese i had my first pesarattu there and yes i loved it i really wish they would serve pancakes too and most importantly have labels for dishes which are to be made to order you must try their range of english desserts croissants donuts and biscuits they also have an array of unique jams which would melt your heart with the soft bread overall a delightful experience

"during our stay at radisson we had our breakfast here and it was very good experience compared to its peers in the area

breakfast review 

a typical buffet everyday seems very wide spread with options for everyone there are about 10 indian options like idlis wada dosas to order pav bhaji puris parathas to order upma poha etc i could not try everything but the paneer paratha was very good and i totally recommend the bakery counter has multiple selections too that comprises of different bread rolls basic breads butterfilled croissants choices of donuts excellent cupcakes etc they also have several selections of beverages hot and cold and soy drinks too vegan options on request variants of muesli and cereals choice of cheese salads fruits etc they have western cold cuts etc and asian noodles and rice alternatives too

pros widespread buffet most of the spread is very good in taste helpful staff comfortable seating

suggestion  would be nice if the staff smiles and makes it more welcoming

recommended  buffets

good ambience and obvious reasons that it is 4 star hotel food options are good but tastes average starters obviously good in taste and main course is ok according to taste not worth up to the price,3.5,
stayed at radisson hyderabad and got to experience this restuarant the dinner buffet spread was decent it is a multicuisine buffet but the chinese options were real good deserts was pretty decent the breakfast buffet is also a good spread the indian options were were tastier,3.5,
i was here with my colleagues for a formal office dinner the ambience and music is all good and suits the occasion but the food was a disappointment everything tasted just average but the price is too much there were no desserts on the menu either overall i wouldnt recommend it unless you have a formal meeting where you do not care about the food much,2.5,
"the story visited to celebrate my spouse is birthday

ambience the place was too bright for a fine dine the presence of buffet right under the nose of fine diners was not really a good idea

etiquette people were nice and professional expected minor surprise for the birthday girl as it happens in many fine dine restaurant when you book table in advance and mentioned what is the occasion

food moderately priced however they lack variety for a fine dine we expected a few new items on the menu but it was not taste wise food was good however the food does not tickle you taste buds

presentation it was not too great mediocre not too fancy

verdict you may visit there for a fancier place in comparison to standalone restaurant

pros price and location in hyderabad

cons food variety and taste",2.5,
"we went to cascade for birthday dinner and opted for buffet

ambiance very beautiful not clustered and has a relaxed atmosphere to it 
service the moment you go in they had all the details as i had booked through a app and we were escorted to our table the service has been prompt and excellent with polite staff and courteous behavior 
food very good spread lot of options for salad i went for the egg salad and the chicken salad very tasty
starters good spread of veg and non veg very happy with the hong kong fish and zaffrani chicken both were very tasty and must have in veg crispy veg was a must have most of the starters were cold considering we went almost at the beginning not sure how it can be cold so fast moving on to the main course another great spread and good options for veg and non veg fish was very salty so i had to pass that other dishes were very good and mashed potato is a must try chettinad chicken was another must have they had rotis and nans to order live i tried the mongolian rice from the live counter did not excite my taste buds much another problem with the main course some items were cold or lukewarm 
some more options in main course was one veg biryani mutton biryani chicken curry chicken curry was something i would go for again but not so much happy with the biryani but again being a hyderbadi the taste buds for biryani is absolutely different 
desserts another vast variety and i will give it 1010 

overall if not for the food being cold and fish item being salty the rating would have been better overall i would recommend this place for a casual dining if you are looking for a place to have a relaxed atmosphere and have food at leisure away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to be 
suggestion i some how feel the placing of the spread was not apt i mean it was very confusing at time and we had to take help again and again for example soups is placed after the biryani a little more organized would be good",3.5,
"a buffet with a nice spread and value for money pricing is always in demand the spices unlimited buffet at cascade the allday dining restaurant at radisson hitech city is an example of this the newly revamped menu of this buffet on for both lunch and dinner ensures that everyone has something suiting his palate quite a number of live counters make this even more interesting

the buffet is priced at an attractive rs 1255 all taxes included invited for a review of the buffet i first did a recce of the items served i was happy to note that huge spread had something for everybody there were dishes from different cuisines ranging from north indian south indian local hyderabadi panasian to continental live counters included those for dosa ice creams as well as pasta and pizza the dessert counter looked pretty extensive too

among the starters was paniyaram the round batter balls popular as a breakfast or snacks this was served with three types of chutneys  coconut mint and tomato i usually do not try veg starters but this was soft and good and the chutneys were delicious
 

other vegetarian starters included potli samosa kothmir vada and assorted vegetables in chilli sauce veg sushis were also on display but i did not try it

chicken quesadilas filled with a nice stuffing and grilled was one attractive dish in the nonveg section fish tikka was a little bit too spicy for me chicken nuggets pepper fish and shanghai chicken dry were the other nonvegetarian appetizers

the pizzas for the day included a simple margarita as well as chicken pizzai tried a couple of dosas from the live counter  my choice was the kheema dosa though the beetroot dosa was a novelty too for its looks like the coloured burgers which are in vogue these days

the buffet also had an extensive salad bar with highlights such as braised chicken  mushroom salad and roasted lamb with onion  cabbage

over to the main courses continental cuisine seems to be a strong point of the chef team the vegetarian main courses included balsamic grilled vegetables a dish which had babycorn carrots and beans in a balsamic vinegar based sauce the sweet and sour vegetable caponata was another dish of note lamb ossobuco an italian main course of lamb shanks with a dark gravy was one dish that was really good poached fish in a watery gravy did not have much of taste the same applies for the roasted potatoes

the chinese part of the buffet had quite a good collection too fish thai red curry went well with szechuan noodles there was a vegetarian dish mushroom  bamboo shoot in scallion sauce which also attracted my attention

the indian section had biryanis both veg and nonveg which are must for any hyderabadi buffet the other local dish was hyderabadi fish curry from the andhra kitchen kodi koora and ulavacharu made their mark maa ki dal and matar paneer were the punjabi dishes served

i am not much of a dessert person but was happy to see a large number of desserts in the buffet sweets included shrikhand rasmadhuri and hot chocolate brownie with ice cream 
 

overall i will not call it extraordinary stuff but it was a nice spread and a valueformoney buffet the lunch buffet which i attended on a weekday had a huge rush pointing to the popularity of the restaurant the menu changes every day so that the regular clientele is provided with a change of taste

not at all up to the mark disappointed ordered food to the room i am staying in and literally left it after having the first taste the presentation was good but food was bad,3,
"an evening in the radisson itself is one it is kind and when the food is unlimited it is just bliss  a heaven on earth

we had booked a table via nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality variety of dishes and a great ambience but somehow we do not know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it it is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that we do not know

when i retrospect back home i thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there not that they were rude but they did not care much the manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us

well coming to the dishes we had a nice sumptuous dinner the best part was the dessert section if had a variety of spreads it was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes
oh boy i had a ball

had the staff had been a little attentive i would have rated an easy 40 i guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the nearbuy but we have been too many 5star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently

food is not at all good and the staff is not professional parking floors are worstthey are not maintaining upto the markbettrr to avoid the radiason,1,
i have been here for sunday brunch being a fan of large buffets strange i got what ever i want to eat in my plate as there are wide variety of dishes and customized food too one will expect radisson will have continental spread with continental style but nah radisson became a local guy with excellent local tastes too my biggest surprise with vada and bamboo chicken biryani vada with chicken curry bamboo chicken biryani with chicken gravy made my day wide variety of desserts are to a special mention hotel management is very friendly and helped to make our experience much better most recommended place if you are a lover of buffets,4,
i was here for a day and enjoyed the buffet breakfast at cascade on a saturday morning unfortunately i did not take any pics but i must say there was a decent array of foods to satisfy many a palate  south indian north indian continental cuisine the staff stayed attentive throughout clearing plates and serving everything that was ordered promptly a great experience here,4,
cascade is a spacious coffeeshop with an extensive menu we tried the lamb burger club sandwich and spaghetti in tomato sauce food was fine although the chef forgot to add bacon in club sandwich spaghetti was yum there was slight delay in service although staff came and apologised later there were good breads available for sale although noone really encouraged you to buy staff lacks initiative,3,
the place is amazing the food is of huge variety the view and cleanliness are appreciated the live music is very entertaining food of all sorts are available best place for foodies a must try in that area,3.5,
"bymanagementinvite feedmehyderabad

radisson hyderabad hitec city has lauched an allnew buffet at their allday dining restaurant cascade and i was invited to try it out recently

being housed in a star property the place has subtle interior designing a great buffet area and a sprawling dessert counter with a mind blowing array of desserts

while i loved the samosas cheese calzones a couple of indian dishes from the buffet like the butter garlic naan and the curries overall their food does leave a lot to be desired desserts such as black current ice cream and brownies were good

"i regularly order packed box lunch from radisson the food is really tasty  the great part is they prepare the order as specified by us  timely delivery and great support thanks you very much guys  ",4.5,
a food lover would always prefer buffets to have a variety cascade 80 plates buffet is perfect for any such foodie the spread is something to experience such amazing variety that it is virtually impossible to try out everything there starters and desserts too good,4,
"after a long time wish to visit radisson today we got to visit this place with my teambuffet spread was very goodwelcome drink was coconut waterwhich is fantastic idea as this is summer seasoncoming to starters veg i tried sabudana vada which is excellent in tasteother starters of veg was normalkodi vepudu of non veg stater was good and spice level was also goodchicken biryani was also good in taste
as it is ramzan season they also served haleem which is not good in tastedisappointed for haleem
coming to starters kubani ka meeta and semiya was goodoverall a nice experience",4,
"i had been here twice in the last 2 weeks with my teams the food served was good
things which i liked 
 number of starters and deserts are good
 food taste is good and medium spicy
 offers different varieties of parathas
 pizzas were served hot on table on request
 pastas and fresh fries tasted good

things which i did not like
 veg and nonveg items are clubbed every where and there is no demarcation so need to be very careful
 buttermilk served was very bland and can be improved
 items were not hot most of the time
 service was bad they missed the pizzas ordered and had to be reminded again
 mint chutney tasted bad",4,
came here for some late night dinner and my experience can be termed pathetic to say the least they do not believe in serving a glass of water unless specifically asked for after 20 minutes of being there the smell of the cleaning liquid was so strong that i lost my appetite and to top it gave me a splitting headache although they claim it to be open 24 hours they apparently start cleaning up the place around midnight customers be damned i asked them to pack up the food because there was no way i was going to eat from there bearing the mind numbing smell after the food parcel was given they wouldnt give me the cheque unless of course again specifically asked for the kind of experience you would expect from a place that serves biryani for rs 50 and not rs 800 endured the 40 minutes of torture grabbed the takeaway and left,1,
scrumptious buffet which reached my expectations i can just say that best place to have a proper buffet with all the items good for both veg and non veg items great service pleased with their service ambience is simply cool,4,
"good ambiance with wide range food options  people having different taste of food can enjoy the place and good for team dinners
happy dinning",3,
we were there to celebrate our anniversary there was a set menu welcome drinkvery refreshing tomato shorbapassablecrispy paneer chicken tikka both were very yummy  butter chicken paneer butter masala both passable  daal fry yummy roti soft and steamed ricethe pasta in white sauce was good but the absolute let down was the pan seared fish with tomatoes the fish was not done properly no crispy skin and was a bit smelly there was icecream too the service was amazing and so was the ambiance,3,
"mr faraan mr llima mrs piyali is awexome and i love the way this people behave and awesome i prefer again to this place it is an awexome place to visit actually i think to live here again next time i visit ",5,
had a great experience at this place went for the sunday brunch and to enjoy by poolside food was great service amazing and loved the setup and outdoor seating,5,
"i was excited about the team lunch at hyatt however it turned out to be a disaster

1 food variety very less compared to any star rated hotels in similar bracket we were offered only 2 types of veg and non veg starters and without even mentioning the dish name no mutton items what so ever neither in starters nor in main course

2  the service was poor and slow i am not sure whether that is for quantity of staff or the quality of staff
none of the staff was nice or responsive in a way that makes you feel good
3 the quality of food changed with subsequent refill  even the ice creams were too sweet",1,
went for team lunch have been here in the past too but experience this time was not at all good food was not good especially the ones that were refilled it appeared as if chef changed in between breads were too dense desserts too sweet chicken overcooked most disappointing was the service which is not at all expected from a brand like hyatt very slow service with a i do not care attitude had to wait very long for some of the requests the only good thing was probably the decor and no one will come back only for that,2,
"i have been here for breakfast its a huge spread as other 5 star properties usually have but i saw a great variety and different kind of a menu here for me a waffle cart was the best part i just loved the hot and crispy waffles with maple syrup nutella and berries compost do ask for a chef is special the breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread
a few other things which i liked were the baked potatoes just loved them
another good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand you had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you in the juices section i could remember a carrot  ginger tulsi aloevera and many such detox water was another addition apart from these you could chose the fruits and veggies you wanted and they would make a fresh juice right in front of you
find attached photos with this review to describe my experience in a better way",4,
"ambience peaceful place to hangout with a small group especially during late nights

service after two visits i can say the service is consistent just like any other top hotels in the same league

food yes i must say the burger is mediocre i went for the tenderloin burger cooked medium this patty has some herbs mixed in it so if you like some rosemary and thyme in your patty try it out
for 850 rupees including taxes i can say it is on par with other offerings in the city with a different twist to their burger 35 stars for their burger",3,
"i do not expect how people are maintaining the place 

the service here was such pathetic i think irani cafes on the roads have better service and delivery time of the service 

keeping the service aside the food is decent and the ambience and the pricing is decent but service is one of the worst i can expect from a star rated hotel

if someone from the management is reading it kindly improve your service if you think there is a need",2,
"breakfast was great
lot of options for health conscious people
continental and local dishes for foodies
service was average though overall great place",5,
"sunday brunch
experience very bad
food not great but few dishes are good
service worst
management rude
billing brunch prices not mentioned anywhere but only on zomato but they say that price is wrong asked the manager mr maneesh singh and prakash to show the original prices on any menu or booklet or hyatt website they replied with bullshit answers

only thing we liked is the place and ambience

i recommend not to prefer this place with family

this management has shown us how a famous brand like hyatt can also be the worst experience",1,
"prices are 5 star hotel is but food and hospitality is just as normal restaurant
ambience is good
i suggest them to increase the hospitality",2,
"food and managment sucks and this place  there is no kids activity as said the manager is behaving like a regular tiffin center person wrong dish names are placed on many items  i do not suggest at all  they charged 2199 plus taxes but on zomato it shows less and different when we asked abt it they gave all bullshit answers ",1,
very very disappointed had been there for a sunday brunch and experienced a worst and slow service the food is below average nothing organised and well maintained the managers are the worst in collage restaurant very unmannered and impolite many of the dishes nameplates are mismatched the brunch prices do not match the zomato prices,1,
i visited collage with friends and was impressed by the ambiance and the service my server tushar was very patient and attentive tried his suggestion of pasta and it turned out delicious i would definitely recommend this place again,4,
"visited this restaurant thinking to have good food but the efforts were wasted we went on a friday and we started eating the starters after starters when we asked for main course the staff told that on friday they have only street food and no main course is available felt like we wasted our money

though the starters were good but main course should also be there street food should be the add on and not the only food

two stars only for the ambience

shubhamtraveltaleswordpresscom",2,
"i have had the breakfast buffet here quite a number of times and it is really a very good spread they have here
they have 3 main live counters  one which makes fresh dosas and parathas second makes the waffles and pancakes and the third makes all the egg varieties
they also have a huge counter for fruits juices and herbal shots
then there is the indian food counter which has multiple varieties like  chicken curry or keema curry with pav idli and wada with sambhar and 3 types of chutney poha or something similar and few more items
there is also a counter which serves noodles sauteed veggies steamed fish or chicken and chicken sausages congee and miso soup
then there is counter with cheeses cold cuts premade salad some sweet jars etc
then there is obviously the cereal counter and the breads counter which has amazing danish bakery items bread pudding and other baked breads
that is a huge list
to top it all the staff is really courteous and polite and the outside seating is simply serene",5,
"honestly i would not recommend this place to any of my friends or colleagues i had dropped by with my colleagues for lunch buffet and we really had high expectations and were hoping for good food unfortunately all the starters were cold and were not even edible  the biryani
the taste was not even close to the expectations a big no no to food lovers
the only good thing here was the jazzy decor and desserts it was a very poor experience overall",2,
"i went to hyatt on valentine is eve around 12am this place is quiet and comfy but infested with mosquitoes last thing that u will expect from hyatt we ordered north indian food which was quite yummy but the service was painfully slow when u enter hyatt u do not expect this kind of treatment unfortunately my date was ruined
will recommend others not to visit this place just because of hyatt tag",1,
"visited the place at midnight
the best thing is it has constant menu for all 24hours unlike most of the late night restaurants
the place looks really great at night
ordered pastas which were awesome although we got it 40min after ordering which needs to be taken care of
will visit again",4,
"i would have rated a big 0 or 1 here if i can its team lunch outing with 40 members i am reviewing this keeping in mind that we paid 1500 per person
food 
there is no welcome drink even an ordinary restaurant offers at least a grape juice
starters  cold not fresh tasteless and very hard to eat veg potato baby corn nonveg  chicken fish
not even a smell of prawns or mutton in any corner out of whole menu
main course  only 2 biryanis veg n chicken and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts 
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it
no fruits other than papaya n water melon is very disappointing from a 5 star hotel
ambience  only tables and chairs are provided no clothes or spoons or tissues on the table just like a road side dhaba
service  too slow and no up to the expectations",1,
the lunch served at collage was way below our expectations  cold and lousy tasting food  only 2 varieties of items in the main course  the soup served was cold  they had only 2 main course items in veg and nonveg  not many varieties of starters only 2 veg starters  desserts were minimum   ice cream varieties were only 2 strawberry and chocolate flavors when we asked for spoons for desserts the waiters were looking at each other as if they do not know where the spoons are  service was poor,1,
"amid the busy lanes of financial district lies this serene place with lots of greenery and makes one feel pleasant on the outset a little ahead when you walk through the lobby lies this very spacious restaurant very well managed place i must say spacious well lit with the usage of a lot of natural lighting the ac temperature was a tad bit on the higher side which was informed to one the the staff but did not find much difference even after informing

service was slow and a little out of place we asked if they could get milkshakes as we had kids with us the lady who went to check this has never returned or answered the query next we found the glasses a little smelly which we asked to be replaced but was never done the rotis took a lot of time to come clearing the used plates took way too long despite informing multiple times asked for shawarmas and some food from the live counters which never happened or only a part of it was served requested for the dessert section to be extended a little further but again took away without informing

coming to the food there is loads of choice except for a few items on the menu nothing is worth a hyatt standard loved the ariselu live counter shawarmas tasted bland and could not take more than one bite mutton curry was too oily and no meat in it it was filled with bones also liked the varieties of rice available

overall a place that could be so much more than what it currently is if only this was better managed it has the potential to be the best",2,
my worst dinner experience ever the buffet is spread is the smallest you will find any where only 2 starters biriyani was horrible steamed rice was half cooked the limited options of curry were also unpalatable my friends had chicken and even that was half cooked my money wasted would never think of going there ever,1,
wonderful ambience great customer service and excellent food flying sunday brunch is awesome do not miss the indian platters and desserts especially,5,
"went for lunch today and i had high expectations on taste of the food
i ordered murg malai tikka tariwala chicken both werent very much tasty chicken of maki tikka were not much tender as well it was not a good experience wrt food staffs were good and polite as usual one cannot ride on the brand value and compromise on the taste i hope this feedback is taken positively",2,
"great place and ambience bad service from tushar was awesome  keep up the good work  highly recommended this place for a romantic dinner ",5,
food was alright a good 810 but there was almost zero attention given to us in terms of service and we had to wait a good 10 minutes even before we were given the menu and this was at a time when the only table occupied inside the restaurant was us outside there were probably 2 tables occupied surprising that they could not manage 3 tables maybe this is a harsh review and there was an event happening at the hotel and they were understaffed but for a hotel chain like hyatt not acceptable,1,
im a midnight owl and this place is just perfect for people like me good service but a lil slow ordered a woodfire pizza and it was just amazing ambience is just like any other star hotel not impressed but pretty decent,5,
"the ambience food and the service just goes hand in hand one of the best places to be in hyderabad for a nice quiet evening to spend with family and friends ",5,
"loved the food ambience the way they treated us

we had mutton roganjosh with roti  as it is on zomato gold we felt it okiesh with the price the gravy was thick and yummy will have to try their buffet next time

extremely expensive for the food they serve i happen to go there on my birthday night and the food was just pathetic and over priced i wouldnt have mind spending if the food was good however it was not this place is not at all for wine lovers as they serve the worst wines at sky high prices the only reason they are getting 2 stars from me is coz of their staff,2,

high expectations but all waste

if you want to visit this place then do not opt for buffet go for al cart",3,
"i have been there with family for sunday brunch  sushis were pretty good  they have a wide range of deserts that are absolutely delicious  they have got food items from all over the world  starting from sushis to lasagne to biryani and appam with stew and many more good place to spend your weekend ",4,
not so friendly staff very less items in buffet difficult to find a food of your choice in the buffet it is little unorganized the waiter says i ll find out whatever you ask but he never turns back,1,
"sadly our visit to hyatt was not the type one would want to remember we were attempting to use zomato gold  out of the 4 of us 2 had gold and to start with they told us we would need to physically sit on different tables to use both gold memberships note  it was 230 at night and the whole restaurant was completely empty we suggested let is do two bills and create the notion of 2 tables if needed why though i do not know zomato clearly says there is no limit of how many gold is can be used at a table but even that was not agreeable they just kept repeating we would need to physically move to two separate tables needless to say the visit just went down hill from there 

not recommended",1,

"had an amazing brunch at collage hyatt hyderabad

i generally stay away from clicking pics at a buffet unless it is something on our table but we were smitten by the desserts so much that i could not resist clicking them each dessert was an amazing piece of craftsmanship delicately plated and arranged esp for something at a buffet

the food and spread were equally awesome there was sushi  mexican  indian asian and pizza

the mexican spread was plenty with nachos being my favorite as they came with lot of sides like guacamole salsa mango salsa and parmesan did not explore the asian side much but they had steamed veg and chicken momos the live counters consisted of pindi chole several types of paranthas appam  stew

the sushi was good but not great especially the wasabi did not have a strong flavor but being a buffet we were still satisfied with what they had

the ambiance was really pleasant initially when we were seated later when we started sweating though we realized we were seated at a bad table as it was nearer to the door leading to the outside dinning area and that is where they also placed their live counters although they could close the door it was constantly getting opened and no one bothered to close it",4,
"visited this place yesterday after going through some of the very good reviews and i must say it is the worst experience for us we ordered pizza and it smelled very bad  secondly we ordered caesar salad and chicken was rubbery and we ended up eating only salad then we ordered club sandwich and spaghetti pasta  club sandwich was ok but again spaghetti was tasteless and bland and had to leave whole dish did not expected such a bad quality food from brand like hyatt and they ended up spoiling our evening ",1,

only thing i would complain about was staff need more clarity on zomato gold as i was being given wrong bill and it took me sometime to make them understand that there way of deduction does not comply with tc given by zomato hope that is taken care so as no other customer face the inconvenience",4,
below expectations experience for us at sunday brunch last weekend service was extremely slow the pizza arrived after 34 reminders food was very average  not appetising enough to suffer the super slow service all in all a very disappointing experience at hyatt,1,
"the breakfast buffet of collage is one thing i die for they have everything one could ask for from american to indian south and north to various beverages like coffee tea juices and what not it is the perfect place for all those who have their breakfast like a king ",5,
"been here in few days back for lunch buffet 
soup salads chinese were too good  but they have only one biryani tat too veg that is my only complaint not sure it is week dependant
our guy mrjohnson extremely helpful and polite 
would definitely recommend",5,
food is amazing the place is gorgeous but there needs to be better coordination amongst the staff they got royally confused on our booking and made us switch restaurants do try the pizza offerings because trust me they are as close to authentic as it gets,4,
went for a lunch buffet the best item i had from their spread is cut watermelon is this real hyatt or fake more than half of the items were served cold every crispy item was soggy as if it was out in open for 23 days i want to rate this place with no stars i will advise everyone in my circle against visiting here for lunch  choose any other place,1,

lack choices in food
i am never gonna get those 1500 of my life i wasted my money
only chicken was good i expected suhshi but it was not in the buffet",2,

"was here over the weekend this place was not crowded at all the staff was very friendly i thoroughly enjoyed the cream of mushroom soup we also ordered a pizza which was huge and more than filling well pretty much sums up to be a pretty and decent place where i wouldnt mind dining again ",4,
had hot chocolate was not worth trying and camomile tea which was good enough loved the ambiance hospitality is something which i loved the most,4,
visited this place for dinner classy ambience given it is hyatt but i would rate the food a notch lower than it is pricier cousin in banjara hills food  mushroom soup and veg sushi were quite well made tried japanese style udon noodles along with japanese curry and maybe it is a matter of taste but both the dishes had excess soya sauce making them salty and bitter i was later told that the noodles should be paired with yamakazi whiskey and the curry with jasmine rice to counter the soya sauce taste it sounded like a good advice but a little late for this time for dessert brownie with ice cream was ordered and it was easily the best item overall pricing is decent for the quality and ambience worth visiting,4,
i have been a collage frequent visitor not to do much with food but i met hy husband for the first time there so i have tried their brunch many times and i can finally say that for the cost their sunday brunch is good but they need a little more spread and little more taste also the staff is sweet but very slow on brunch days since they expect self service on that day,4,
went for a dinner buffet for a family gathering and the food is just average for the price we paymost of the items are not available on the buffet menu which are served at the table but with lots of delay,3,

i happened to stay in hyatt gachibowli during one of my visits to hyderabad the hotel gives you a feel of a resort by the open space available and the jogging track around the hotel with trees on both sides the sunday brunch that they organize was amazing and had a good variety of dishes from multiple different cuisines the breakfast buffet meets the standard as well the staff here are extremely courteous and proactive although they do not have a wide spread in room service menu the steak and smoked salmon was extremely impressive,4,
"went for a sunday bruch and compared to other places of the same league the staff is definitely the most friendliest  but the food options are the bottom most on my list the food is good definitely but for a sunday brunch the options are extremely limited compared to what is being offered around i am thankful to the staff for pulling together a cheese platter just to accompany my wine and for that i took them to 4 from my initial 3  sometimes the smiles and the courtesy make a lot of difference and might want me to visit again the beverage alcohol  menu is very limited  does not match back to others  i hope they match it up we had to separately order drinks as there was nothing on their selection that we drank   and before i forget  their dessert bar is good ",4,
"service  good
food very bad no taste at all

i had buffet there is no serving on table for starters and there r only two veg starter and two non veg but taste is not at all good",1,
nice ambience but far too less items as options for food in the dinner buffet would suggest the management to improve the spread as we hardly get couple of options per cuisine in this multicuisine spread that hyatt offers,3,
"the buffet meal was worth the price you can have around 14 dishes and around 10 desserts and of every type continental chinese or italian whatever you like you can try anything since it is the combination of all with a pinch of indian dishes also the environment is really nice and the staff is polite and helpful the red velvet pudding was my favourite with other type of pastries the presentation of the dishes was also nice the main attraction was the live kitchen to serve you your noodles and pasta ",5,
visited this place a couple of times i have experienced great service and quality however i felt they have less options in buffet when compared to other restaurants overall a good experience,3,
"friendly staff amazing ambience and fantastic food
went here for breakfast buffet and the experience was amazing
the food spread was wide and delicious lived that options were there to choose from indian continental and american  quality and taste we are amazing
a must visit in my books",5,
my experience with hyatt collage was amazing the exquisite palate of mine consisted of paneer tikka which was soft and succulent and tenderly cooked loved the minestrone soup which had the balanced taste of tanginess and sweet and it is my favorite for its beautiful outdoor seating area,5,
been here for a buffet lunch on weekdays spread was really limited and the food was not that great do not recommend to anybody else these guys being a costly place should have atleast taken care of their spread and taste,3,
"i came here for a buffetthe overall experience was averagethey have a huge spread to choose from only in the salads and when it comes down to starters and main course i was pretty disappointed because of pretty limited options i had to choose from even from which there was just a single starter that made me even think about secondsthe deserts were decent i loved the chocolate icecream

moving on to ambience the seating and the restaurant was pretty decent and i think the true look and feel could be experienced at its best if you were to visit the place for a dinner the service was pretty swift

the ambience was superb being a part of a 5star property the attendant was very well mannered and cooperative the lunch buffet was really delicious and available at an affordable price a definite must visit this was my third visit to collage this time with my better half a must try buffet place because of the variety of starters and desserts also the main course was good but in buffets i only dig the starters and desserts which were in abundance will go again soon,5,
"friday afternoon lunch collage  hyatt gachibowli awesome so being a foodie both me and my wife when we have the option almost every time we will choose the buffet so did today the food was delicious almost every each item was tasteful very few were on the average side they have 3 main counters one with asian food one continental and one with soup salads and desserts the have have live chat counter and they will cook pizza and pasta if you have a request i think that the stars of the day were salami pineapple salad and the blueberry cheese cake
ambiance was peaceful and having the option of eating outside al fresco  italian is always a plus service very good staff was quick and helpful all in all a very good experience

kudos to team collage",5,
"a sheer disappointment on 12th may 2018 at the buffet dinner  the food was served cold  the service was not up to the mark  the only please take thing was the chef guiding us through the course of the meal  the bill was a hand written one with no copy provided  the balance cash was returned after half an hour  even though i am a member of their club at the hyatt  i was not given the membership benefit i was entitled to  utter useless service and truly disappointed  you surely lost a loyal customer ",2,
"we went there for dinner
the place  the ambience specially the outdoor was amazing  the service is good
the food though was oknot that great",3,
"we went there for a buffet breakfast and it is definitely one of the best spreads you think about a breakfast dish and it will be there be north indian south indian or english delicacies it has it all

the fact that there were no mangoes its the season was quite disappointing also there could have been more varieties of paratha as there was only one subz paratha

the ambience is impeccable they have indoor as well as outdoor seating the indoor is very comfortable and the outdoor is fun with great view and kids play area

very courteous and polite staff

will definitely revisit

the place is famous for their lunchdinner buffet so hoping to have that the next time ",4,

"sometimes the most unexpected evenings can turn out to be the best one me and my wife both food lovers do not enjoy 5 star buffets and hence we avoid
we ended up here as someone dear gifted us a couple dinner voucher and with just few weeks left for its validity we decide to give the place a visit on thursday evening
closeby to our office we reached the place located in nanakramguda just near the amazon office and opposite waverock
we presented the voucher and they guided us inside with a preference of outdoor or indoor seating we choose the former
the ambience us very nice dimly lit with slow breeze would be even better during winter months
we ordered for some cold drinks and went onto explore the buffet a fine spread with a good assortment of indian and continental dishes one could take noodles and pasta from live counters
starters
soups  salads  dimsum fried chicken the options for typical indian starters are less when enquired by the staff attending us about the quality we told them about the having less of indian starters  they promptly arranged for some fried fish and chicken

main course
biryani rice wet varieties of chicken mutton and fish one could lean into the continental side too with fried rice and noodles

desserts
the best spread in hyd from my experience it ranged from variety of sweet bakery products to the indians traditional sweets none of them will disappoint you people who have a habit of starting the buffet backwards are in for a treat

overall we spent about 3 hours chit chatting enjoying the food and experience amazing service must recommended for people who want to just unwind after a hectic work day

we went here for dinner and enjoyed the food service and ambience the hotel looks very good bit of resort types in the middle of financial district concrete jungle we had pasta and a veg dish along with rice and a dessert flavour was good but the dessert menu was not impressive the lady who attended us was very helpful and warm,4,
"there are two restaurants and they are collage a multi cuisine restaurant and deori authentic india cuisine restaurant i always have my breakfast and dinner at collage except the first day at this hotel
many service staffs take order and serve foods all of them are thorough in the mindset of serving customers especially among these staffs parmeshwar and lalmalsawmi have very good sense of service and are outstanding to understand what customers really want
from the moment of entry to the collage to the exit they really care about my moving path within the restaurant in case of parmeshwar he always greets me with smiley face and guides me to my table he always asks my feeling of the day and recommends the food as per my mood he is always getting me things i ask for and never forgets brings me things whereas others sometimes forgets as they are always busy and be asked by other customers for things on their way to get something i ask for he has very good knowledge and insights of the industry and field in which he work and talk with me the way it needs to be improved for better service as for lalmalsawmi she always keeps an eye on me she brings me chopsticks or kimchi depending on the food i order even though i do not ask she knows how many ice cubes i like in a glass depending on the types of beverages i drink she never forgets to have water bottles frozen in a freezer a day before i play golf because i drink a lot of water while i play golf under the smoking hot weather this is something i even forget myself and that is why i really want to thank her generally the grade of service from this restaurant is excellent but as i mentioned above i specially want to convey a lively sense of gratitude from the bottom of my heart",5,
"i have been staying at hyatt hyderabad gachibowli for seven 7 weeks as of today
first my stay at this hotel could not be any better because of the services and hospitality that this hotel is providing to me especially in terms of food

my first concern in terms of going abroad is about food i usually go on business trips for more than three months staying at one country regardless of your nationality just imagine how hard it would be to have food which you have never had in your life and you have to deal with the food more than one month when you stay at a hotel and the hotel prepares same of similar dishes almost every day you will be easily sick and tired of having the food all the time besides india is a country where it is hard to find restaurants that serve pork or beef dishes furthermore as being a korean cilantro or coriander are something that we are not used to and do not use in the food cooking but most dishes in india are with this herb regardless of the type of food italian japanese thai or chinese however i find foods at this collage restaurant at hyatt hyderabad is not using those herbs for western or asian food and this is what i like this restaurant the best besides for buffet dinner majority of the food are daily changed i personally consider this the most important factor for longterm stay guest just like me

therefore my food life at collage hyatt hyderabad is always happy because of so much efforts the chef prashant chef pushkar chef sankhar and chef santosh are putting into to cater my taste in addition they study korean food or other asian food and cook for me as special treatment to please me sometimes we even talk about food making and recipes and they cook some special food as per my special request

during breakfast and dinnertime these chefs always come to my table and ask if the buffet foods at the collage restaurant fit my taste

i strongly recommend everyone that collage is a place you must have meals during your stay at hyderabad lastly through this review i sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart",5,
came here for a team dinner the restaurant managers prathmesh and kamalika organised the dinner brilliantly the entire staff was very warm in their hospitality and their buffet was top class we had an absolutely fantastic experience,4.5,
great experience nice food enjoy the ambience service 55 mainly the buffet description and menu options is comfortable to all i liked the venue will visit again,5,
absolutely lovedeliciously great combination of yummy crispy crunchy juicey university and divercity and integrity and constancy of love care  honor relativly food bevrages ti serv the nation,5,
amazing food amazing staff loved the buffet spread and the sunday brunch was outstanding one of the best in the city a must try guys go for it,5,
we had dinner at this place last night the spread was quite lavish but we personally felt that nonvegetarian dishes were less when compared to the pricing of the buffet the food was average as compared to the other hyatt at banjara hills the only thing i enjoyed was the fresh ravioli pasta they were serving and also they had no soft drinks included in the buffet which is quite stingy but the service is top notch and the staff always keeps a tap at your table and was eager to serve us which was great,3,
"had lunch buffet today but disappointed  

no choice of our food can not be ordered i mean other than mentioned in food menu  

very less food options compared to others which have same brand level

but ambiance is very good it is a pleasant peaceful
service is also very good they are very polite",3,
"was visiting my in laws for the first time to celebrate the occasion we came here after more than hour long drive and oh boy did this place disappoint not only did they lack the basic services like serving papad and water in the beginning they made blunders like serving long island ice tea to a pregnant woman instead of the lemon ice tea that she ordered we were a group of 11 people and were seated in a private room we had to keep going out of the room to call the waiters only to be responded with an arrogant attitude especially by the restaurant manager parmeshwar from lucknow each order took a long time to come and was served cold and when i say served i do not mean served by them oh no the waiters simply kept all the dishes on one side of the table and left it to us to serve ourselves despite of this on lack of better judgment we made a horrible mistake of ordering the dessert which we just left after a bite because it was that bad needless to say our night was ruined and to end it all just when we thought it can not get any worse they over billed us we spent 20 mins to get it corrected the icing on the cake was the charged us for the long island ice tea as well 
please avoid this place at all costs and you will be saving a lot  you will also save yourselves from mosquito bites because they will refuse to provide you with a mosquito repellent when you ask for it
p s if you are a cheese enthusiast please do not make the same mistake of ordering the cheese platter as we did for 600 they served us stale cheese with few almonds crackers and 2 apricots whoever originally came up with this dish must have shifted somewhere n hisher grave when these people had the audacity to serve something like this to us",1,
"one great place for breakfast  the buffet spread is great and the service is impeccable loved everything on the menu had memorable time here happy eating ",5,
awesome hotel service is state of the art really enjoyed my stay here i was personally received by chef amit patra a wound full chef who made our stay worthwhile,5,
"positive
1 great place for a team outing you get your space
2 nice facilities
3 buffet had a wide variety from north indian to asain to street food

negatives
1 not much choice for vegetarians
2 too costly for its quality",3,
"for a tram dinner on a thursday i listed down few places and finally desided to go to collage  hyatt hyderabad gachibowli i very shorty realized that it was a wrong choice

except the place nothing was good specially the menu and the food was not really good

the items on the buffet were so limited that i hardly had anything to eat multicuisines on the website continental italian north indian chinese asian thai but in reality only continental and asian

that too without a chicken starter in the continental department and the fish served was so salty that it was not at all eatable not even a single indian item was found in the entire menu

so kindly revise your menu on zomato",2,
"my first stay in hyatt and it was just awesome we had our dinner and breakfast at collage food ambience was good and best part of hyatt was their services which made me bowled from room service to dinning they gave their best

i hope in my next visit can find some barbecues ",4,
collage is an absolutely picturesque restaurant set amidst lush green environs of hyatt hyderabad gachi bowli it is an all day dining restaurant with an open italian style kitchen focusing on home style food we tried the lunch buffet and it offered the best of international cuisine including european and oriental and a good variety of local andhra delicacies the biggest plus point is the location and ambience chef is further working on a new menu and look which will be unveiled on 24 june 2017 look forward to that,4,
"went for sunday brunch with a lots of expectations about the food  spread was going over after a very long gap truly disappointed to see the brunch at this level 
very less options of nonveg on the buffet both in indian  western
only a chicken pie  an oriental chicken dish inside in the indian had only biryani  raara gosht
the highlight was in place like hyatt your serving vada pav as part of the sunday brunch come on you must be really kidding me i am sure you can do better than this 
lauki mussalam on the vegetarian spread just to name a few of the not so appetising options there 
pizza was just like an indian papad with some dry chicken and cheese on top
the place has just got some upgrade only in terms of just some artifacts new linen etc but the food quality  buffet spread is so so so disappointing 

sad to see hyatt go down like this",1.5,
"invitedbyrawpressery bloggerhaul 

so buffet breakfasts is something i particularly enjoy and the one i had at collage hyatt hyderabad was quite a decent one at that 

hyatt gachibowli is a beautifully done property and collage is one of its pretty restaurants with a variety of options to choose from the buffet breakfast a quite a steal

from american favorites like muffins donuts waffles and croissants to indian delicacies like masala dosa idli and usal pav most of the things were delectable fresh cut fruits juices and salads live omelet counter tea coffee milk different types of juices a selection of breads different types of jams and cheese well the list is endless 

overall a lovely relaxed sunday morning spent this

instagramcom",4,
"the food is toooooooooo good the interior and the ambiance both are very cozy only the staffs could have been a little more attentive
the wash basin and toilet should have been as neat and clean as the restaurant",4,
the food is too good the place is very cosy and will give you a homely vibe people there just welcome you with a big heart and a broad smile i am in love with this restaurant,4,
"excellent food but the service sucked  the staff there are just not interested and they act as if they do a favour to you i might only go there for the food only ",2,
after so many of goody goody excellent reviews i been there n i was very excited to taste the foodz i was missing northeast taste but sorry to say it was not upto the mark it was ok chalega type  being a northeast i know wat it should taste,2,
this place has always been polite and friendly the lady who has been taking care of this place is like a superwoman who make sure that no one goes unhappyno matter how busy this place is that lady always have a happy to serve expression i always come to this place on my off days,5,
"the best place in hyderabad to have pork and beef together amazing taste  quality of meat a paradise for north eastern cuisine lovers zing is serves large varieties of nonveg dishes in a pocketfriendly budget just a reminder this is not a place to have vegeterian foods i have read many reviews explaining how the vegetarian people were apalled by the smell of raw cooked meat while visiting this restaurant they are very misleading and misinformative first of all you shouldnt be here if you are looking for veg momo or veg fried rice period
i tried almost every pork starters and every mocktails available in their menu not once i have been disappointed every food items is tasty enough to deserve 5 rating
the one little place for improvement could be to increase the number of staffs due to excessive demand they find it difficult to cater to everyone at the same pace hence you would find many reviews telling how their service is slow how people waited for 1 hour after ordering for food to show up personally i have never experienced such delay

ps they cook amazing ramyun noodles",5,
"very authentic food different from what you get elsewhere in hyderabad their dumplings pork ribs beef fry everything was awesome great job ",5,
"this place has been a bookmark for me since very long as there are only few places which can serve pork after seeing all those positive reviews in zomato i decided to give it a try
i along with 3 of my friends went on a friday eve to this place

appetizers 

1 deojikalbi  this is a pork appetizer we loved it very much and repeated the order for the second time we asked the restaurant staff to increase spice levels in the dish which turned out to be really delicious

2 pork ribs  i did not enjoy this dish really much meat was tender but the sauces they used did not satisfy my taste buds i dunno if northeast people love this type of food but it is ok it was my first time

3 pepper chicken  due to unavailability of lemon grass chicken we had to order this appetizer taste was good  nothing fancy

main course 

1 ramyun with pork  we ordered 2 rumyun with pork taste was good but we liked the other dish which we ordered

2 soba noodles with pork and veggies  this dish tops the list luckily i am the one who ordered this dish and my friends were having ramyun
soba noodles have a dark sauce and intense taste compared to ramyun if tasted really delicious i cannot say how perfect this dish is

3 nagachicken rice  when restaurant staff placed this dish on our table i saw chicken was undercooked i asked the same to them they said this is how northeast people like to eat a bit chewy i thought chalo let is try it but chicken was so chewy that it is taking 5 minutes for me to complete a small piece of it
i was disappointed with this dish

overall experience 

food  35  5
service  35  it was too slow
ambience  35  5 cute lil place but gets crowded on weekends

i will definitely recommend this place to everyone sometimes we need to surprise our taste buds with some new cuisine  and this place has got delicious food too",4,
the authentic taste of north east indian delicacies one will find here with mouthwatering dishes good place good location but the quantity of food per dish served is little smaller,4,
"could not resist posting this review has been visiting this place since the time it opened  has been there multiple times never before felt this urge of posting a review since the food always stood out and dominated the service

but nothing changed over the time in terms of service rather it is turned worse over time there can not be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service if food is the only yardstick they fail to beat that as well dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste

as a customer i would rather not visit to wait for two ordered dishes for an hour worse food that can be had sooner is always better than slightly better food with infinitely worse service",2,
food is not bad but not like northeast service are very slow n staff will not response properly i did not understand its northeast food or korean food i ask for northeast food n disappointed,3,
"have been to this place so many times that i have lost count great food especially the beef and pork dishes although at times some of them seem similar
good value for money be patient for the service worth visiting at least once then give it a chance to win you over",5,
"a fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes

drinks

1 berry blast loved it i would say it is my version of a drink the right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour

2 green ice mountain mojito you can find green apples in this drink a little sour although i liked it

i would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course

teriyaki chicken served with flavored rice nothing special about its taste this is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had

beef  pork kimchi bokkum bap i just liked the flavor of the rice both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same they were mixed with the right quantity of porkbeef the piece were eatable and not much chewy

pork  beef naga chilly curry the flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste the taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness the gravy is ravishing as well

service just fine the waiter did not have a pleasant look on taking our orderserving us

overall fine dining experience

ambiance  455

food worth the money  45

service 355",4,
a little understaffed when i visited on a friday evening and while the food lived up to its usual great standards i was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable i have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times i have been here kudos to the team for their effort nonetheless i know it was a busy night for a small 2 person service team,3,
"went there after hearing a lot of buzz about this being a go to north eastern place but such a bummer
ambience  1star the place does not not have exhaust or ventilation and has only 2 acs which seemed to not work it is connected to the kitchen so was smelling of the meat no music we were asked to occupy a table which had used plates still kept
service 1 star the staff did not seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us
not to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktailswe already read about their slow service so was expecting it
non veg food momos were very average like that of zomos may be
veg the ramyum noodles were literally veg maggi very misleading name and price
veg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice",2,
"this place should realise that a dinein restaurant has to provide some basic service and just having decent food is only the starting the place offers good for nothing snobbish service by staff that cannot communicate and who do not give a damn about you you can die asking for something and you will not get it they do not even bother to keep cutlery at the table not even tissue papers the ac does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven

coming to food if you manage to get what you like on the menu it is a miracle they open at 1130 we asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 130 and were told very unapologetic rather rudely that they do not have it finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order now the taste the ingredients are very good and fresh the quality of pork is great the taste does not have much variation everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different after a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice if this is how the food of north eastern india is well i will avoid that geography and i will surely avoid this eatery there is no excuse for bad and rude service",1,
"this was on our list of places to eat in hyderabad for a while but what kept us not going is the popularity with meat i am a vegetarian and wondered what i will get seeing bibimbap on the menu  i had to try it

we ordered fried tofu appetiser and bibimbop and freshlimesquare

drinks were as displayed tofu was bit disappointingit was literally fried tofu with sauce on it and sesame seedscan miss this if you plan to go

do definitely try the bap tasty and filling great portions of the veggies rice saucealthough rice wasnt sticky and i thought dolsot bap always came with hot claypotnevertheless tasty

in the middle of the meal we asked for hot sauce and there came the sauce very tiny quantity we were like wtfthe sauce was hot made from naga chillies yet sooo goodburned my tongue but loved every bit of itso if you have rice remaining give this a try as well

staff were courteous as well

one star less just for the tofu rest was perfect

will definitely visit again",4,
"it is amazing for the people who eat beef  pork the lemon grass chicken was good too

i only eat chicken but i have seen that all the dishes were very well cooked and the texture was nice my friends loved them

must visit for the people who like beef or pork or north east food",4,
the food was delicious but the service was hilarious i am giving 3 star only bcz of the food we have to cll again and again more then 5 times after than finally they come,3,
"amazing amazing amazing
the best place to have all kind of pork dishes they are just cooked to perfection honestly better than the 5 star restaurants in town
amazing food for amazing prices
super budget friendly

so happie to have found this place for my pork fix
added to weekly outing to my schedule",5,
"had heard about this place from a colleague of mine post which i decided to try it myself a quaint little place opposite sln terminus this joint serves authentic tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover is delight we had ordered minty cucumber in mocktails a korean appetizer tangsuyuk kalbi bokum smoked pork fried with bamboo shoots and teriyaki chicken all the dishes tasted good the teriyaki chicken was too sweet though
would love to visit again and try out their other delicacies",5,
"this place came with high recommendations from a food expert in the industry for the last two decades or so

visited zing is northeast kitchen on a saturday afternoon for lunch and i was not disappointed at all we ordered for 

roast chilly lamb  dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli ginger bell pepper and garlic the lamb was sliced thin with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 55

deoji kalbi succulent spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce the pork melted in the mouth beautifully prepared 55

steaky pork ribs available only on weekends  the pork would just come off the bone a weekend special  55

kalbi bokum sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 455

dotsol bibimbap  hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up a special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 55

all downed with nonalcoholic coolberg beer

honest food prepared with a lot of passion absolute value for money i would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations",5,
one of the best places in and around hitech city to have good food price is very decent and main course portions are also very good  would surely come back again,5,
terrible food deeply dissatisfied ramen is just fancy looking maggiliterally which is totally off no sticky rice or special authentic sauces very sad to see such low standards of food nowhere near authentic pan asian food,1,
"delicious food amazing place reminds me of my hometown place would definitely visit again for a scrumptious delicacy of north east and lastly would recommend every beef and pork lover thank you zing kitchen was a lovely evening ",5,
the place is very cosy and neat not many big furniture is or things tiny place but spacious the food is simple and tasty the presentation of the food is great the service is good but i think the communication with the server was a bit of a problem overall a good experience,4,
"every dish is wonderful here at zings great quality and taste fresh meat served with awesome tasting gravy try the teriyaki chicken
the main course as well as the starters in pork and beef dishes are yum especially their naga smoked curry",5,
friend ordered chicken scullent non veg ramyun chicken sobs and square cut along with virgin mojito the food was very good and the bill came upto 627 which was a very decent deal will be visiting place,4,
"a place with an authentic south east asian decor

if you ever happen to be here certainly try their raymun noodles a little bland however seems authentic

they also have good chicken drumsticks to offer and the nonalcoholic beer is good to go with the food they serve

a pocket friendly place for a lazy evening",4,
the kimchi is to die for the momos pork and rice are top notch as well amazing food amazing staff and a cozy place to share a meal with your family,5,
service was too slow due to lack of staff ac was not on hence we were sweating inside as it was conjusted had high hopes of having our fav dishes ie chicken momo  dotsol bibimbap but none was available and the items which we ordered were undercooked ie lemongrass chicken  garlic prawn,1,
"starters
kalbi bokum sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables
butter pepper garlic prawns prawns toasted in fresh herbs lime pepper and chilly flakes

main course
 naga steam fish made with naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes
 teriyaki chicken served with flavoured rice and green vegetables

drinks
summer time and summer lime orange juice served with fresh orange mint and lime commingled with masala
fresh lime soda sweet

of the four dishes listed above the first three were recommended by madcapmanikin and even though i trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food the woman does know good food she hasnt been off with her recos even once but zing is came highly recommended by suchismita chatterjee dutta as well the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point

in all honesty when the starters arrived i felt that the portions were quite small i could not taste the prawns because allergies but the enlightened one felt that they could have been a tad fresher and even though the waiter told me that the kalbibokum was not too sweet i could have lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy

but believe you me when i say that the main courses changed the game completely the first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush the explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic i literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal the raw mango slices the fresh fish the tangy tomatoes oh the side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again and the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish shuntki maachh just slayed this bangal

it was only by the end of the meal that i realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up the quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally

this is comfort food sanely priced impeccably portioned honest food that warms you up from within",5,
"we wouldnt have found this gem of a place if we had not been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch more than a month since we visited but it was such a treat the place is tiny right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it

the menu is pretty extensive but going by our love for pork we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer we ordered soba noodles with pork and veggies naga pork curry which came with rice and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots

the noodles were alright but had sort of a maggi consistency  but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor the naga pork curry was a revelation  spicy but so full of flavor my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit the fried pork was delicious too but an overkill going by how we were already full with the first two dishes 

we had ordered the flavored beer they have which was refreshing but relatively overpriced but just for the food i think we need to visit again highly recommended for the cuisine they have on offer",4,
"this place is definitely worth few visits for any foodie to try different north eastern and asian cuisine
the pork belly dishes were really tasty also appreciate the staff helping us eat the right way",5,
this has to be one of my favorite restaurant it is a tiny cosy place that serves korean and northeastern food i am reviewing it for the second time and how much i appreciate this place being a korean food fan in hyderabad where options are little less in terms of getting koreanne cuisine the owner is super friendly and courteous the kimbap is good in taste serves 10 pieces per plate which is worth the money 180bucks accompanied by wasabi and soya sauce just because of kimbap i can rate this place a 4 happily,4,
"had visited this place after a friends recommendation and what a experience wee visited in the evening hours so we are not that hungry just wanted a quick bite tried their chicken momo and pork ribs both of them were extremely delicious and cooked to perfection we also tried there summer time mocktail but initially it was served under room temperature after requesting them the add on some ice it tastes fine
we would loved the place and would visit again soon
thankyou ",4,
had an amazing time at zings beware place was packed all through out amazing food and drinks to go with it the ambience is nice and their food tastes great,5,
totally welcome change from the regular flavours wonderful choice of pork and beef dishes succulent meat dishes flavours one can not savour in the fanciest of restaurants,5,
"northeast kitchen located right beside pista house has been a good find for me

i have been there more times than i can count on my fingertips

i love the simple ambience and the food
i will not vouch for consistency though service is slow and really slow on a full night

my favourite dishes here are the steaky pork ribs smoked pork with bamboo shoot and bibimbaap momos are decent
soup is canned something i was a little shocked to find out
their mocktails are also very good

although there are fallacies the food still makes me go back again and again",4,
"small but cozy place if you are looking for good north east food or korean food
the place usually packed but you would definitely find a table staff is polite and friendly
coming to food there is so much on the menu to try on
pork ribs are most recommended but they are only available on weekends
beef with onions and chilly is good they come with complimentary rice which is unlike normal indian rice more like how koreans eat
you get non alcoholic beer here which goes well with the food",4,
"having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that is a part of india but different from the other usual cuisines led me and a bunch of my friends to zing is for dinner

first up we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant the starters were quite good spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork
the main course however was disappointing or perhaps we expected something else the ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of top ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them there was not enough broth either which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles the teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally

the best thing would be the prices everything is so resonably priced it is not easy to find nonveg especially pork beef etc at these prices

one major area of feedback would be the service they have an extremely laidback dontreallycare attitude and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time

a little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently maybe even start a franchise 

value for money 355
service 25
ambience 35
overall 35",3,
been here with friends for lunch the moment we entered in to the restaurant you will feel as if your in some eastern states we ordered drumsticks chicken teriyaki and om chicken rice the drumsticks were good with sauce and best part was chicken teriyaki it was delicious and tasty and the om rice was okay overall food was good and service was okay,3,
"i read a lot of reviews about this place before visiting most of them read that the service is very slow i only realised it after i went there
i was so tired waiting for my food that i only had starters here and went to some other place for dinner
food was no wonder very tasty

we ordered drums of heaven and pork belly in chilly sauce it all tasted really nice

i hope the place works on their service",3,
i have been here many timesthe food are really delicious and nice placestaff are good and friendly as wellbut one thing food used to pending and waited for so longso you have to get more improve deliver food on the table and not letting them wait for so longthank you for give us apportunity to have the good food,5,
had been there today with the reviews seen here food was below average we ordered lemon grass chicken  2 pork dishes naga chicken curry butter garlic prawns chicken raymun noodles out of all this lemon grass chicken n pork never came to our table staff are very very slow very dumb very very poor service forgot half of the items even after writing down guys just be prepared each dish takes a minimum of 30mins for it to arrive at your table never going here again,1,
very late orderhe forgot half of the food that i orderedhad to keep remindingthe staffs are not friendly at allthey do not even talk to you straight facenot polite do not visit,1,
"it was a bad experience worst part was when we entered the places and there was this pathetic smell to welcome us another issue you can not just order anything from the menu because maximum number of items were not available

the food was smelling too

i ordered steam naga fish

if u really want to eat get a masksuggestion",2,
best restaurant if you are looking for authentic naga food away from north east i would recommend everyone to try here at least once thanks you guys for bringing this in zomato too,5,
if you live anywhere in hyderabad and you love eating pork and beef then this is a good place to try none of the dishes contains masala and the chutney given as complimentary with the main course is worth trying though it is very very spicy because of the bhoot jolokia happy feasting,5,
"the staff is a little less knowledgeable and understanding when it comes to explaining the dishes they do not have anything for a vegetarian guest  we had one vegetarian friend in a group of 10 who starved 

they restaurant smells for the raw meat from the kitchen

the mocktails are good the pork is mid rare and juicy however the chicken is not that good",3,
"i had a good experience 
this was my first time in zings northeast kitchen
the starters were good 
but i was disappointed when i got two of my orders not available
next time when i visit i would love to have those starters too 
lots of love 
thank you ",5,
the food was excellent i took one star off just because the staff behaviour could be improved if you love north eastern cuisine and southeast asian cuisine a must try,4,
"first of all they dint have main dish for which i went bibimbap and kimbap but still i got teteiyaki chicken and noodles sweet and simple place with pretty cozy ambience people who serve food are very friendly but there were only 2 people who were serving food so our order came really late place is really famous so people were even waiting outside for seats
tip please call them beforehand if you are specially looking for bibimbap",3,
"such a disappointing visit went at around 730 pm menu was given having lot of options to choose from beef pork chicken fish veg i do not eat pork and beef so asked for chicken momo not available veg momo not available mung tang fish item not available full steam fish not available
i walked out of the place without having anything",1,
"first things first
decent food average service affordable pricing big on non vegetarian delicacies

small place with cute interiors serves up some mouth watering momos bruschetta and ramen
good things take time especially if it is a newbie kitchen trying to serve you food be patient the service is slow but the food is good

if you are looking for a bowl of north eastern style of ramen try their version of it simple soupy and well spiced it is a bowl of comfort let is not get your hopes high just yet it is their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic ramen that is usually popular otherwise

the momos are good soft and melt in the mouth must try they run out of the vegetarian ones rather soon


overall it is a small place give it time nurture it go for the experience",3,
"hard to get hold of their attention after a number of visits i now have come to terms that it  usually takes 1015 mins for them to come tend to you heck even a glass of water takes time to come to the table service needs to get better  

anyways coming to the food a great place for most things pork my favorite dish which is something i totally gorge over is the bosam nicely sliced pieces of pork belly kimchi and tender pices of chillies each bite is a bliss the kimchi pork fried rice is good too though i wish they could improve upon the quantity of pork in the dish",3,
"my 1st visit to the place for lunch and i enjoyed their food
we ordered lemongrass chicken it was nice but not strong lemon grass flavor though but the chicken stew with rice was awesome it was very light yet very flavor full i will surely visit this place again to try their korean menu foodlove",4,
"having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place and the 45 rating on zomato it was on my wishlist for ages but i was always skeptical of the taste being too authentic and a totally new cuisine the former proved to be true and was the primary reason i did not have a very pleasing dinner

it is a small and cute little diner like cafe with minimalistic and soothing interiors the sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially but i got used to it in just a few minutes some room freshener would do the trick

the items are priced very cheap i had high expectations but only to learn later the portions are just too small we had

 spicy drums of heaven 1405  the only thing i could properly finish a typical batter fried chicken almost south indian and spicy in taste but the coating was too thick

 chicken succulent yakitori 130  3 skewers with tiny chicken chunks spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle texture was good but taste average sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like

 chicken momos 1305  standard good amount of filling with a very pungent ginger flavor the coating was thick too chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy and went well with the momos

 bosam 170  it was my first time trying pork belly and i can not really judge but it felt fatty and gooey the pieces were drenched in grease served with spicy kimchi which i loved

 chicken ramyum noodles 180  big bowl of noodles what looked like maggi but was only a close resemblance scarce chicken pieces undercooked dry and hard noodles and overall a very bland taste

 naga steam fish 250  this was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant and i could not tolerate it a very very pungent and strong odor the fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection served with steamed white rice

whatever i mentioned about the food was just my impression and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine i did not really like it

however one thing that was disappointing was the service it was slow and just took ages once the food arrived it was fine but again the bill took more than 20 minutes

as many others have already said i guess the strong point of this place is their pork preparations and i would recommend this place purely for that an elaborate menu with lots of options priced well

here is my overall score
food  355 not judging what i tried first timedo not know about
ambience  45 get a room freshener
service  35
vfm  45",4,
i would give a negative star if possible for their hygiene and service we ordered our food at 930pm and after an hour is wait they come and say that what we ordered from the menu is not available we had to order something else and wait for another 30mins and then to my surprise i found hair in the food so in short it a was a terrible experience,1,
"had a lot of expectations after checking out the positive reviews for zing is there was some weird smell when we entered the outlet which was a bummer we asked for momos which were not available so we got lemongrass chicken and the portion size was very disappointing and shocking drums of heaven was another appetizer that we ordered which was below average we then ordered ramyuen noodles which was tasting and looking very similar to maggi we also got ohm fried rice which was very bland and tomato ketchup was used for presentation the waiter who took our order looked disinterested so i really do not understand what the hype is about thumbs down ",1,
"we had a family dinner at zing is with very high expectations considering the ratings we ordered the following 
moroccan eggs  45
chicken satay  255
drums of heaven  355

noodles  05 they were like instant noodles with no tastemaker
fried rice with omelette  25nothing much
pork bimbipop 35 the only decent thing in the main course

all in all it is not worth the price we really wanted to like it but were really disappointed",2,
"had the misfortune of visiting this place on new years day we were given the run around with the table then it took them 30 mins to take our order only to forget all about it after an hour of reaching the place we realise the food is not even ready

not even an apology thoroughly disappointed",1,
the food is amazing their service needs to improve a lot 5 stars for tasty food and elaborate menu the staff was very friendly and can help you with ordering the right dish,5,
"the most amazing naga beef i have ever had the pork ribs are to die for the pork belly melted in our mouth most of the dishes are tasty as hell
portion is kinda small but the price is correct for the portions
service is a bit slow one area they really need to improve is to get more andor better trained staff
but the flavor of the food makes up for everything making me give 5 stars",5,
love for asian food brought me to this place this place would accomodate 30 35 people at once approximately food are well made with almost authentic taste tried pork momos which tasted really good specially the pickle that goes well with momos and you would not find it anywhere else in hyderabad as per my knowledge after that we ordered dotsol bibimbap which was a colorful food which would please your eyes and ofkorse your savory mouth and fill your stomach for sure depends how much you eat p i was full with one bowl  one more dish that we had ordered was ramyun noodle which i felt almost like maggie with a very slight difference but it was soothing and filling only thing that had disaapointed me was the late service we almost had to wait for 40 mins for our food,4,
this tiny joint serves excellent northeastern  east asian food their beef curry with naga peppers is heavenly deojikalbi was excellent as well the beef soba noddles was also good though less so than the other two items the portion sizes are a little small but then again the prices are pretty damn cheap as well the one area where they can improve is the speed  efficiency of service but since it is fairly new  has a very small staff at this point possibly family run  i am optimistic that they will improve as they mature,5,
"i seriously did not understand the buzz around this place decided to have sunday lunch here owing to the good rating of this place the staff did not really give any attention and we had to find a table for ourselves
many items on the menu were not available even on weekend and we settled for veg clear soup mushroom  spinach soup to start with the quantity of soups was a bummer and it was a huge bowl quarter filled with soup if they plan to serve this quantity then they should switch to smaller bowls to atleast give illusion of a filled bowl mushroom  spinach soup tasted like maggi knorr soup and not fresh
for starters we opted butter pepper garlic prawn it was served in a small plate with even smaller portion 5 tiny prawns for starter definitely does not justify the taste was average  better than soup
for main course we decided dotsol bibimbap and naga chicken curry main course was way better in taste and we really liked bibimbap naga chicken was good in taste but had mostly bones
the portion size is major disappointment here and its evident across all courses another point of concern is their service be it taking order suggesting food or even table service the staff is not really helpful and takes forever to respond",2,
visited this place with much expectationsbut got disappointed with the service and the bad smell inside the restaurantwe ordered chicken momo and lemongrass chickenchicken momo was very okayishn after waiting for a long time the owner informed that they need lot more time to make the dishas we could not wait more did not get chance to taste the dishservice needs to be improved,2,
food is awesome and loved the chicken momo and the chicken noodles good authentic food a must visit for any momo and noodle love however expect a delay in service,5,
"one of the very few places that i tried north eastern food the place has a cosy setup with interiors and cutlery that totally go with the theme of the place

we ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl ramyan noodles bruschetta and doenjang jjigae we absolutely loved the jjigae which is similar to a vegetable stew and absolutely rich with flavours the teriyaki bowl and noodles were definitely above average they served the teriyaki bowl with sauted spinach on the sides perhaps more vegetables would have been better all in all a great experience",4,
bad experience when ordered food from here prices looked very reasonable while ordering and literally the quantity was very less they should be mentioning that if we are ordering prawns for starters they are giving exactly 6 pieces of them very disappointed with that even though the taste is good,1,
"i was pretty excited looking at the 46 rating but quite disappointed i would rate the food at 4 though but service is extremely poor the staff is not good at recommending dishes the beef curry with naga chilli is not good probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste the pork belly was good beef fry was not great because meat was undercooked the steam country chicken curry was good

i would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because i really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now",3,
"cute little place with great food and superb presentation the interiors are simple and pleasant the place is very neatly maintained and appears hygienic
this place is just walkable from my office and it has been my go to place since the time i discovered it
i love their garlic prawns chicken yakitori teriyaki chicken and noodles",5,
very low quantity for the price,1,
hello guys this will be honest review we visited yesterday7th dec as we heard a lot about this restaurant we had a mixed experience here when you enter this place you will definitely feel a bad smell inside that was really disgusting we ordered chicken lollipop smoked pork bosam and ramyun noodles food was awesome except bosam we did not like the taste so if you want to try northeast food surely you can give a try,3,
"perfect northeast kitchen in the town
the pork rice is delicious and noodles are gooddo not expect a regular noodlesthe non alcoholic beers are good
and fries are very good",4,
this is my go to place i can never get bored of their food and ambience happy to see them in zomato food is always great love the ramyun noodles and bibimbap best time to visit is on weekdays on weekends there is too much rush and food orders get delayed i would suggest to add more items in their menu,5,
"been here twice in less than a month and i hope i can keep coming back

i absolutely love their food the bibimbap is to die for and the king chilly pork only slightly less so their icecream also manages to be excellent

the service is a bit shifty but we can not have everything unbelievable prices for now as well definitely go here if you love meat

slightly louder music and tea would be great additions but hardly necessary",5,
"this amazing restaurant is not exactly in gachibowli it is located between sarath city capital and sln terminus mall in kondapur

we visited this place when it had just opened and we were surprised with the quality of the food for starters we had pork momos everything including the presentation was perfect beef soba noodles and teriyaki chicken rice alongwith roasted chilly lamb and each one was competing with the other for a place in our hearts the beef had a lovely texture and was well cooked it was a tad on the bland side but tasted great nevertheless

the ambience catches your eye and one fails to control the urge to click pictures of the walls the people are nice so is the food you could keep visiting it",5,
we were soo excited about the place but somehow not satisfied firstly the place was in utter silence the ramyun noodles bosam butter garlic prawns were all just mediocre and purely serves just 1 lack of salt was felt in some dishes yea but the mock tails were good,3,
"finally some korean dishes in a restaurent in the city have tried their
bossumkorean lettuce wraps
dwaenjang jigaesoyabean paste gravy with vegetables
kalkuksuplain noodles with chicken
daeji kalbiporkbelly with ganjang sauce
steam fish naga chili
everything was soo goodloved the soyabean paste gravy and ssam was pretty good tookalkuksu needs more broth to itit was very dry with little brothwish they did not use instant ramenthe serving pots gives life to this placeam visiting this one again for suremy love for asian and authentic cuisines made me visit this one and it did not disappoint",5,
"forget the 4 or 5 rating given for this restaurant this place is crap i will say except plating nothing will please your appetite customer service i will give 10 for 15 tables it a single guy who was taking orders in between all this he is also the one who is at bill desk too believe me they did not served water until we are forced to ask for

customer service  they do not deserve a rating for it
food  1",1,
the restaurant is a nice decent place and pocket friendly too food taste good but i personally think there are too much soya sauce mostly in everything the menu is mainly korean with very few ne food in their main course sectionfor people who really want to experience northeastern food i would suggest that the main course section might be helpful for you over all m happy that i found a place to hop in whenever i feel like having pork or beef,4,
it is a fairly simple restaurant nothing too fancy with some parking available right in front of restaurant however the climb is way too steep has pork and beef on menu a great addition to kondapur food is good portions are small but that is by hyderabad standards otherwise one dish is enough for one adult we went on a sunday and we had to wait for close to one hour to get all items ordered maybe we will try it on a weekday if waiting time still is that long it needs serious improvement overall a new addition for niche crowd,4,
best pocket friendly place in and around gachibowli if you are a fan of south korea and north eastern cuisine and yes there is a lot of love in cooking korean food and every morsel tastes wonderful small place good range of menu and pocket friendly price must try  smoked pork ribs pork bosam  naga steamed fish and chicken ramyun noodles,4,
"i have been waiting to write a review for zing is north east kitchen for a real long time and i love what they cook n create it is a little restaurant on the very opposite side of sln terminus gachibowli the food quality is amazing just feels like home quantity and the price are reasonable and i have lost count of the number of visits i made strong recommendation for pork and beef lovers ",5,
"for all the pork lovers now you have an amazing outlet right at gachibowligreat food  very good staff personal care from the owner just loved it ",5,
"an awesome foodie experience that takes you telepathically to the kitchens of north east india will come here again and again for the taste of their food if not for anything else

food 45 the pork dishes are awesome and the noodles were delicious this is one place where though your stomach is full your heart wants more only thing i do not like is the noodle that they use feels like instant noddles and i feel this could be better

service 35 service is very slow they seem to be a family run restaurant and sometimes which is more often than not when they are busy service can be very slow they have to very soon hire some more helping hand if they continue to experience this much of demand

ambiance   355 simple and minimalist interiors of a north eastern roadside joint

price  45 pretty decently priced for the quality and taste that they offer it is really a steal deal",4,
"an extremely accessible joint situated on the main road with a pretty good variety of north east cuisine and a polite bunch of staff we planned to try anything but options in pork so we ordered pork belly with veggies n kimchi salad the particular dish is supposed to be consumed is a unique fashion the pork belly veggies and kimchi are to be placed on the lettuce leaf and wrapped this combination is delicious and you would love it next we had smoked pork ribs which i assume had barbecue sauce and sesame seeds and tastes pretty soft tender and yum the beef curry and steamed rice was decent but extremely spicy you can specify how spicy you want your dish and they can suggest or customise their dishes
ambience is nothing but ordinary and it draws a decent crowd even on weekdays
but i would definitely go back to try the other delicacies do visit and indulge into their menu",4,
"i have been looking for good porks in hyderabad n finally found it  pocket friendly and delicious food you would find over here right opposite to sln terminus quick service decent interior and courteous manner pork ribs beef curry chicken momothe list goes on do not miss this place ",5,
i visited this place once and oh my oh my lemme tell you this place is ahmaaazing the food was amazing we ordered pork and it tasted so good just melted in my mouth i am salivating just by thinking about it maybe there was just a little extra soy sauce in the food but however it was it was really good highly recommended will visit soon chompchompchomp,5,
though understaffed this place is really a treat for someone who is not used to north eastern food i took few of my friends for a treat and ordered multiple items out of which pork ribs and teriyaki chicken turned out to be amazing keep up the good work,5,
if u wanna try good pork in hyderabad then this is the place love the pork dishes from starters to main course staffs are well behaved  food is not expensive as well a must visit for pork lovers,5,
the food is amazing easily one of the best pork dishes i have had in hyderabad the restaurant set up is like a cozy little shack and this along with the food transports you to another place entirely i am gonna become a regular here,5,
"we went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while

starting of with the pros the decor and ambiance of this place is really good the menu is quite interesting too and includes a variety of chicken pork beef and some fish dishes there are a few vegetarian options but i do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian they have a good choice of mocktails as well and each one was really good the pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too the staff there was good too

moving on to why i chose to give this a bad review first of all the service was really slow took about an hour for my food to arrive moreover my chicken noodles tasted exactly like maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in i had attached a picture of it for reference moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes a small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people even though the taste was good because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined
hence the two stars",2,
"so yeah let is start the reviewing part
1 costly place and not much appreciated for students
2 service is really very slow
3 quantity is not much appreciated but kinda okay but not all dishes
4 they had less staff

so done with the negative part and the positive thing is that you get to have pork there which is rare in this area and the food is not that great but kinda okay if you wanna try something new and also spend some extra bucks then go for it not much of a satisfactory feeling here 2 stars for the delays and less quantity of food in fat ass price happy dining",2,
sad experience at zing is after hearing so raving reviews about this place folks at the restaurant were least bothered in taking our order right since we sat down on an empty table half of the food items on the menu werent available maybe they need to shorten the menu just to include items that are available round the clock we had ordered pork with bamboo shoot which i have had quite a lot of time at my hometown siliguri unfortunately this was not nearly as good as i had before although i will not judge the restaurant based on just this item as chances are it was a one off case but the service and staff attitude was a real put off i had very high hopes but was completely let down something seemed to be very off as a restaurant having 46 rating usually will not come across this way either my bad day or the chef is,1,
"it is authentic
it is delicious
it is a must visit
i visited the place two times and it seems to get better every time the food is very good and the staff is extremely polite and friendly",5,
this is a small joint for those who love north eastern food it is just opposite to sln terminus i usually have chicken momos from this place as i love it but this time i also ordered chicken teriyaki bowl the quantity was a little less and tastewise it was okayish the ambience of this place is quite good but the service is a bit slow i will be trying out other food items as well and accordingly i will update my review overall i liked the place,4,
"tried smoked pork with bamboo shoot and ghost chilly and chicken momos a perfect blend of everything
best chicken momos in all of hyderabad 

affordable price and great food",5,
the taste and quality of the food here is on a slippery slope i used to love the boston creme donut what once used to have a juicy creamy filling is now a miser is dab burgers have also lost their taste and are mostly insincere,2,
i have eaten at this place a couple of times before and the donuts were decent but today we picked a few donuts to take home and when we tasted them they felt so stale and tasteless as if they have been made at least 3 days ago this was definitely not expected from them,1,
the donuts were not fresh it was pathetic in taste worst donuts ever eaten i ordered three donuts in which two was completely uneatable and the third one was also stale and had a bad smellthe smell was like a chemical added,1,
stopped here to have a americano and a boston cream donut the coffee was good but the donut  did have less or no filling at all i am not sure if all these places have the same procedures for hygiene coz i bit into something i did not want at all the staff did apologise but it was not a pleasant experience the place did not look like it was taken care i expected dunkin had the same standards thru out the world,3,
"we have ordered dunkins but it was not fresh and no taste

please do not prefer this outlet

it was not baked properly and taste was not good",1,
"this places always serve one the soft and tasty donuts the verities are very good to look and to taste

they do server other menu items a part from donuts but this is mainly a donut place so expect much from the taste of the other menu",4,
bad service staff does not know english does not know about their work donuts are bad place is also not clean i wish hyderabad opens mod soon not recommended at all,1,
i ordered 3 donuts online and all of them were hard and not fresh and not edible to eat at all i have no option but to throw them in the dust bin very very disappointed,1,
"i love burgers and donuts here
specially eclair donut and big joy veg burger 
staff here really very good
choclate milk shake and fruit berry smoothy are best drinks in cold

can u plzz deliver upto gulmohar colony 
if u extend ur delivery placesdunkin will really get much appreciations",5,
"dunkin donuts has always been a great donut place according to me they serve excellent coffee and burgers as well i particularly love the naughty lucy burger which is an all time favourite
this time i decided to try their new grilled chicken monster burger and i was a little disappointed as a whole the burger tasted fine but why on earth did the chicken burger have a layer of hash browns such a bummer 
however the donut did uplift my mood in the end brining the final rating to 35 man does that death by chocolate slay me everytime pun intended ",3,
"i been to this place on a saturday morning to have a  i was really disappointed with the service in the first place the air conditioning was not working i still compromised to have the donuts after having the donuts the staff was not able to give me the bill saying that billing machine is not working i had to pay the parking fee for my car since i was not having the bill
i had a bad experience",1,
"located in sln terminus on the ground floor this joint has a good seating and decent ambience

the place is a bad maintained one in terms of staff and food a donut shop must have sugar glazed donuts at all times but initially they refused to serve one

finally the donut i had was the caramel vanilla the donut was first served cold despite telling them to heat it the donut anyways turned out to be a good one perfectly sweet and hot the caramel however was not upto the mark

for the drink i had vanilla macchiato the drink was way different from illustration it lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same so there was no vanilla in my coffee

i would suggest skip this place and head somewhere else for the sweet cravings post dinner",2,
loved the ambience of the place also we ordered a box of six classics and all of them were delicious alongwith the popular chocolate ones do try the caramel strawberry and colour pop ones too also do try hot chocolate orange and hot chocolate hazelnut definitely a must try place for me,5,
ordering donuts from this place is a nightmare they always forget to heat the donuts even after insisting we have to call the executive and tell the same just to make sure,2,
very tasty donuts  loved the packaging and also the flavour s were different from each other the donuts were soft and nice  everyone would love to come back and have them,4,
"the donuts were fresh and tasty however these donuts were little small in size compared to donuts served in other outlets the ambience was good but needs a little maintenance like the tables were not clean and there were flies around
overall it was good",4,
"i just came out of this outlet the food is as per dd standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance

the tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it the wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes

for payment too when i decided to pay through the mobile wallet instead of the standard qr code or getting a request for the otp i was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system was not working",3,
just 5 mins from my house and been there hardly a few times because i did not quite soulfully enjoyed their donuts the ugh quotient is missing in the doughnuts here which makes me donot do the dunkin donuts,3,
bit costlybut taste wise its goodalmost the taste of usagood variety of items to choose from good place to visit ambiance is good also,4,
"though the brand is famous for donuts i would have to start the review with their burger after having got bored with mcd kfc and other popular burger places dd is burgers are just stunning also their bun is slightly different which tastes even better over others  the chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in unfortunately it is overpriced

coming to their staple food they are great as well they got tons of options so not possible to review all of them here but i would highly suggest having their death by chocolate

and their packaging is great i loved the boxes they provided",5,
had ordered a pack of 6 donutsmango craze very very strawberryboston creme eclairs2 and a rainbow pop all i got were chocolate donuts never ordering from here again,1,
"food  5
vfm  35
packing  35
service 35

have been to this place multiple times this is located at the bottom floor of sln terminal mall ordered heaven can wait chicken burger double big joy and big joy veg burgers
heaven can wait was awesome with two chicken patties of pepper and spicy flavors along with lettuce cheese and jalapeo sauce packing for delivery can be improved though
the big joy buggers were fine but lacking in sauces",4,
very disappointed with this outlet ordered four donuts all four were not at all fresh the crust had solidified and donut bun lacking any moisture i am not ordering from here ever again,1,
"the air conditioning was not working half of the items in the menu are not available the staff is limited and took more than 10 mins to take the order

my first experience was a memorable one but not for good reasons",2,
"donuts were okay
milkshakes and thick coffee was horrible
ac want working and tables were very dirty
wouldnt recommend anyone to visit",1,
it was quite late in the night when we reached here had opted for veg burger french fries and fruit berry smoothie the service was prompt and the food was good,3,
"to satisfy my donut craving stopped at this place ordered some donuts and hazelnut iced coffee i would give a 5 for the donuts as they were delicious but the hazelnut iced coffee was bad it was very diluted and tasted almost like flavored water
i love their donuts but drinks should be made properly too please look towards it",3,
this place is severely understaffed very hot in the afternoon ac does not work properly tables not cleaned unless asked donuts are tasty though will not visit this place again,2,
"have been there couple of times
1 great ambience and a nice place to hangout with friends spacious and well arranged
2 staff are well managed and kind
3 i had caramel and chocolate donuts veg burger taste was awesome

overall a nice place to spend time with friends over a coffee and a donut",4,
no burgers oven is broken no ac why are you open we usually get takeaway burgers and this is unbelievable very poor management i wish they will improve there service because the location is excellent,1,

the picture says everything how delicious they were best donuts in town for sure little cosy place for chitchat pocket friendly good service and nice location will try something else next time,5,
i made online order for pack of 6 all time favorite donuts the donuts were not fresh waste of money what is the point in having fancy packaging with bad quality food,1,
"landed up here on a saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff following summaries my experience below

ambiance the ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of dunkin the walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the dunkin outlets i have been to in pune and mumbai ample seating for say 30 people 355

service you pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat it is an entirely self service type of mode nothing extraordinary 35

food we tried the following two doughnuts

kit kat doughnut the doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish not exactly of it the chocolate factor was also less the freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 45

mango doughnut literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart just for that 35

will i come here again i like just one here which is ugly strawberry do try that if you like strawberries",3,
"had naughty lucy veg burger meal alive by chocolate lychee litchi donuts and filter coffee dunkin style
the burger was cheesy and tasted good the donuts were excellent  especially the center lychee filling in the lychee litchi donut the coffee had a hint of caramel and is worth a try in all would have rated it at 35 as ac was not functional but will go with 4 for donuts",4,
"as soon as i opened the box i was so excited to eat them the presentation was wonderful but when i had a bite the doughnut was not fresh at all same with every doughnut in the box dissappointed such a waste of precious money on not at all fresh food ",1,
"nice store outlet of dunkin donuts we ordered the packof6 flavours and liked all of them  buns are freshly baked and flavors are refreshing
overall its a nice place to dine onceinawhile to satisfy your sweettooth pangs",4,
no complaints regarding the taste or the quality their timings are terrible they do not serve before 11 even though the opening time is 10,2,
searching for that moist fluffiness and crisp crust that makes you love a donutthen this is the place especially if you are fan of chocolate then break up party eclair is a must to try,5,
you should close the store i had worst experience i was served a stinking chicken burger and had to return the same even though they served a new one it was still having the foul smell the food served is stale here,1,
"ambience  45
very good place to sit and enjoy with friends
food  45
really mouth watering donuts other food and baverages like burgers coffee are good to have other than donuts service  45
really quick service do not make you wait alot",4,
total wastage of money it just bread and creamy flavour on top of it it is not even a bagel what i got was plain bread with creamy flavoured on it this is the first and last i am ordering from here,1,
well it is as good as it gets i personally love sugar glaze classic and honestly it was perfect for me i wish they had blueberry jelly donuts as well,4,
better timings,4,
not all the donors are fresh i got a donut which is hard as a rock,3,
the ambience was fine the chairs were cozy i liked the bengaluru start up coffee death by chocolate donut tasted like chocolate cake and rainbow pop has the right amount of frosting and the donut itself was very soft potato wedges were horrible the pieces were very big and two of them were not cooked properly,3,
good tasteloved it,5,
"donuts were fresh  yummy
love the ambience and variety of donuts they have 
staff was friendly and smiling 
best breakfast place in town ",5,
the yellow mango one was the best of the lot best i have ever had the variety of chocolate flavoured ones added to the sheen full marks for the packaging the eclair could be improved with a tad more chocolate inside also if the box contained descriptions of each donut it would be easier to figure out which one is which swathi muthu,4,
was never ever a fan of donuts untill i tasted at this place each donut in the box of 6 is simply outstanding ambience is great value for money is good too having tasted donuts at few other places undoubtedly this is better of all a must visit place for anyone who loves donuts,5,
favourite cafe for finger food as they have a variety of donuts and burgers surprisingly their burgers are better than their donutsi have tried almost all the donuts and they never disappointed me and so goes with the burgers veg mayo is the best as it is different than routine burgers with a twist of mint mayo in it cool place to hangout with friends,4,
"dunkin was supremely professional both at restaurant and served through zomato the quality of doughnut and hazelnut coffee was quite good and worth a try pls note the manager at the sln terminus was so customer centric that he turned up to deliver to ensure customer satisfaction  kudos to them ",4,
"i went out for evening snacks the place was not clean as it should be as tables were untidy even the floor

i have ordered for a box of 6 assorted delight donuts and one signature burger both the donut as well as the burger was fabulous in taste but they were out of stocks for most of the thing

the service was good and on time

lovely food,5,
"i want to take a moment  praise the bangalore startup coffee as much as possible it is undoubtedly the best coffee i have ever had
donuts are too good
place is nice with cozy sitting arrangements
just that for cool drinks mainly lemonade crushed ice consume 60 of the cup
rest all good nice experience",4,
not even a cover they have given to hold the box but the package cost charged for 25rs that too in rain,2,
"i always stop by while shopping to a have a quick bite of yummy delicious donuts  i have almost tried all of them but the donuts which are my favourite are very very blueberry boston creme  mango dazzle

i always search for very very blueberry but it is hardly available now",4,

"i love the donuts here and have possibly tasted nearly every flavour my absolute favourite is the cinnamon because it has the perfect level of sweetness i prefer

the stuffed donuts are a must try

you will surely become a donut lover if you visit this place once do give it a try",5,
"delivery service is at its worst food is ",1,
some bad donuts and some surprisingly good burgers that pretty much sums up my experience with dunkin donuts if you are bored of the usuals like mcdonald is and burger king do try the burgers at dunkin donuts and give the titular donuts a complete pass they are dry and the toppings too sweet i always remember the burgers from dunkin donuts as crisp tasty and juicy and that is exactly how the big joy veg burger was when i tried it last weekend truly a big joy,3.5,
"2018 is the first time i had chance to eat donuts interesting desert to eat with good amount of chocolate

we also had burger and hot chocolate

burger was good and beverage was perfectly sippable

  ",4,
nice place to have donuts been here multiple times and left this place with a smile as the environment is healthy and staff is nice to you and of course the food is great,4.5,
well what can i say about this place it is nice for killing time but if u plan to have good food it is big no donuts are good but the service here is pathetic a better service and good coffee would make me go back till then it is off the list,3,
"been to this place a few times before known for its donuts also serves burgers smoothies coffee etc had the big joy chicken burger newly introduced today along with iced coffee the burger was pretty decent not so great i would say the iced coffee should have been more properly blended
my favourites at dunkin are
burger  naughty lucy chicken burger  45 and for people who love cheese it is 455 
donut  alive by chocolate 455
finally i would say the ambience is good  45  nice hangout place near gachibowli 
food is decent with an exception for donuts they are very good so on the whole i would say 355
service  45",3.5,
"had a box of 3 donuts post lunch at sln terminus would rate the donuts individually

they run out of coffee regularly the store is very poorly managed it takes at least ten minutes for them to generate the bill even when there is no one else there because their systems are always down,2,
"been there for just chilling
service is very good and located in a good place ambiance also ok
but they need to put attention on food quality",3,
i and my friend went to have burger on a very heavy rainy day the best part is that french fry was so yummy hot spicy feel the fresh potato if you are a fan of french fry like me will recommend to go there,4.5,
"raw potato hash the hash browns were so raw in the middle the burgers sauce was more on the wrapper than the burger the potato wedges were badly seasoned

comparestudiocom",3.5,
the best and one and only place to eat donuts in hyderabad the chocolate donuts make you indulge into it and the sweetest of all,4,
worst burgers i ever ate this place is really bad when compared to other outlets half of the burgers are not available and other burgers are tasteless grilled chicken tasted like boiled chicken burger will never visit again,1.5,
saw the poster of arabian iced coffee at dunkin donuts so thought why dont i try it out in this beautiful rainy weather it was heaven for me when i sipped it chilled with rich creamy flavour with lught kick of brewed coffee thats how i like itso the new addition in dunken donuts family us a cool onewould definitely have it again,4,
simple and sweet outlet i liked the episode outlet with some great graffiti the service counter girl was kind of ride though as we said something for order and she ordered something else and then she argued well for the love of donuts  the chocolate and the mango craze and the rainbow pop were awesome soft spongy and colourful were the words the taste of mango craze could be improved more though the chocolate over the donut was little rough and it meant that way i guess so overall great,3.5,
"i can not say the donuts are too tastyif you are a sweet lover you can once try thiswe ordered a pack of six and i felt no difference in each of these in taste they look similar except the yellow onemango flavoured

i did not even feel it as fresh one as soon as i ordered he bought the one which he has packed it and kept as stockoverall i was disappointed for the first time being there

once you can try this as a snack but it is too sweet
ambience i can rate as 355
food35",3.5,
"unhelpful and rude staff according to zomato they are supposed to be open till 11 but the staff gives excuses to not accept orders at 1045 also probably because they want to leave early on top of that they have the audacity to behave rudely

do not visit this outlet",1,
"it took me so long to pen down this review 6 days to be exact and why you ask well that is because i had to taste 6 donuts in all

yess i decided to try the festive rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini donuts ranging from death by chocolate chocolate filled mango flavored two classics etc all this priced at rs 199 plus taxes this roughly came out to rs 243

so much goodness in one box

now i can not name each of the donuts but i can say that majority were chocolate based of the 6 donuts 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones

the first one was the classic sugar coated simple and goody good

the second one was a chocolate coated classic donut this one was fine

next up the mango flavored one this one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam this was a fresh taste after so much chocolate

the fourth one i think was death by chocolate this one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate

the fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling this one was ok

the last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling this one was good the topping had some sprinkles too

all in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there
definitely a must try

breaking away from my usual style of writing i will come to the location and ambience after the food
so this outlet is located on the ground floor of sln terminus very easy to locate the board is visible from the road

the interiors like other dunkin donuts outlets is quirky with pop colour furniture and interesting wall designs on a sunday afternoon the place was moderately crowded

service was good no issues there would love to visit again",4,
this has been my favourite donut place here i tried almost all the flavours n varities they offer in donuts last week i tried their burgers both chicken n veg the veg burger was horribly bad the other one was okayish so i recommend this place only for donuts,3.5,
"it is a new kinda place for new kinda food which is donuts i liked the donuts but the beverageshot  cold are not upto the mark

food and quality 355 above average
service at the counter 255 below avg
ambience  seating 35 average
overall 35

the service is very bad and the reputation of such shops are going down because they are treating all the customers as those low class business meet holding people in hyderabad

however the taste of the beverages is very bad the below are the beverages we tried

1 tough guy cappuccino
2 mocha chip
3 jamaican rum with almonds

ps just try varieties of donuts or burgers do not go for beverages",3,
"ate ma first donuts here they we are just amazing  the ambience is so good  a perfect evening treat after a tiring shopping spar
mango craze  alive by choco are my favorite ",3.5,
i really liked the donuts specially all the chocolate ones its in spar market in kondapur i really nice place to have donuts apart from donuts they also serve burgers,4,
after reading reviews i was having high expectations from this place so i ordered litthi choka if you are a big big fan of soyabean then only you will be able to eat food otherwise they put lot of soyabean oil in everything which make food taste so bad,1,
"the one star is not for food it is pretty decent

i visited with my friends and the crowd was really less we were there for a short period of time and awaiting our cab the staff was constantly asking aap ka hogaya

we informed that we are waiting for our cab and the one of the staff member pointed out there is your cab

they just wanted to get rid of us was the place crowded no were we eating there for free no

never visiting this place again",1,

"litti chokha lovers missing this delicious dish in hyderabad can definitely give it a try they serve litti with 3 variants of chutneys chokha and salad
chokha was a mixture of potatoes tomatoes brinjal garlic and green chillies
littis were properly baked and had sattu in it overall a healthy dish i also tried mutter panner here it tasted good
the vibe here is happening with good music and they also have birthday celebration space
i would recommend this place",4,
this place is becoming a nice go to place in the recent times live music affordable pocket friendly food and good service litti chokha is one of my favorites here,3,
"ordered litti chokha seing good reviews they sent 2 littis with chokha two chutneys onions and lemon the littis were good enough however the chokha was blandthe only taste i was getting was of mustard no freshmess of coriander flavour of garlic or onion taste both of the chutneys wrre tasting almost the same the only dominating taste was of raw mustard which overpowered everything the food lacked freshness
they need to work on making fresh chokha with fresh flavours",3,
"its an open space eating place famous for their litti chokha although they have a range of options to order

recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha they serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni

the service is very slow so you need to be really active to ensure that your order is through",3,
"from long time was thinking to go this place for litti chowcha today was the day we went for dinner

litti chokha was yummy although delivery took more than displayed time liked them delivering 3 types of chutney as well will order again,4,
not good and my experience is not at all good  the litti chokha is very hyped here but i do not feel the same it was below par  the other food experience is also not good,1,
"best place for hangout and i can say it a saviour for hungry people food quality and quantity both are good
we have order chur chur naan combo in which they give you 2 stuffed naan daal makhani and raita and it was yummy",5,
amazing place to unwind must try chai very live place perfect for late night chai one of the coolest hangout place in kondapur must try,5,
"this is the place for litti chokha drops the mic

food  455 the litti cokha is just amazing sitting in hyderabad and getting such quality food that reminds you of your home town stalls is really something would have been nicer if the chokha was a bit more hotterspicy but understand that such taste would not go well with lot of foodies here i have gone there again and again for litti chokha and have very rarely tried other things this time tried the chinese plate and really liked that too

service  355 it was a self service join which now services your table timely service and good behavior there is very little more to expect

ambiance  35 has a very nicely maintained outdoor sitting beside road

price  45 the place is very reasonably priced for hyderabad standards though 2 litti for 100 bucks might sound expensive to someone from east india    portions are good and taste is impeccable",4,
the litti size was splendid the chokha was perfect and the three chutneys along with lemon and onion was simply too good really loved everything,4,
love litti chokha littis were well stuffed aloo baigan and tomato chokha was awesome they are serving 3 chutneys too along with that if you are a litti chokha lover and living in hyderabad visit them you will definitely love the food,5,
felt like having home made chicken,5,

i am sure i am not going to use zomtato or this restaurant services in future",1,
litti chokha this is actually they are known for  back in patna they are serving on of the tasteist litti in town but if we really see for something mouth watering near me with a budget of 90 bucks  i really do not recommend if you are not in search of litti chokha they are good but they can be much better i hope you will know after tasting it once i do not really believe to spend 90 bucks for a litti chokha when i am hungry and have more options in this price,3,

"this open air restaurant situated right at the mouth of the whitefield turning has branded itself as a chinese and north indian restaurant but the chinese on offer was not good at all the soup we ordered had a weird taste and we did not dare to venture further into the chinese menu the restaurant had to offer
the litti chokha on the other hand was pretty good and they even claim to serve the best litti chokha in town can not say whether it is the best or not but they did get it right",3,
i was passing by that road and was instantly connected with the restaurant is set up and live music its an open air and add to that is the soothing live musici thought of trying a quick snack and the staff helped me choose one litti chokda was the dishit was delicious then i presumed to order some pander makhani and burtter roti it was nothing short of heaven  loved it and would go again,4,

food quality is good with medium level of spice might feel little costly comparatively but must try for everyone had biryani multiple times but never disappointed,4,
a seriously underrated spot in gachibowli i have been here a few times now and experimented a few great dishes they have great afghani and arabian foodtheir a little pricy and the chinese food is too spicy if u have not been here give it a try but avoid the chinese side of the menuunless you are a fan of spicy food,4,
not so expensive place but can definitely give it a try  had patthar ke gosht and the meat was tender  though the taste can be improved a bit  had biryani also and was nice   can be visited with friends,4,

the food served here is delicious and mouthwatering the pictures of the famous dishes served here are displayed in the lcd tv is just the pictures themselves will activate all your taste buds if you are going with a group of 68 members i suggest you order platters instead of individual starters

in the main course we have ordered the famous dish of this restaurant daawat khaas murgh musallam it comes with chicken marinated with ginger garlic paste and stuff with eggs and mutton keema leaving the hyderabad biryani aside this was the best main course item that i have tried in the recent times it easily serves for 34 adults and it is really a must try dish if you are visiting this restaurant apart from that we have ordered paneer pasanda with zafrani roti the paneer pasanda curry tasted little bit sweet and none of us have liked it

and coming to desserts we have ordered kashmiri rabdi and kaddu ki kheer both of them are really good

service

hyderabadi daawat a new place in town located at gachibowli a place know from serving pure authentic hyderabadi cuisine and this has been in my list to visit since this place opened

talking about the ambiance it is gorgeous simple and spacious with beautiful interiors and great flighting

we were here for lunch and since it was our first visit we were confused what to order then we asked the management to send their signature dishes

but before that since it was very hot we ordered for mocktails
strawberry mojito virgin mojito blue hawaii soda fountain and mango mule were among the mocktails we had they are amazing and refreshing

started with yakhni shorba very delicious mutton was cooked properly soup was served very hot

murg sholay kebabs the signature starter of this place very well presented with the mini bbq sizzling grills the chicken was little hard should have cooked for a little longer

wok tossed chicken chicken was soft and tender tossed in sauces little sweet chopped with bell peppers and spring onions of topping absolutely delicious

phuket fish one of the best fishes i had recently very soft perfectly cooked slightly spicy a must try

sikanderi raan the house speciality the most tender meat i have ever had in life probably the best you will get in hyderabad very tender full of masalas and loaded with ghee the marination for the whole raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table highly recommended

chelo kebabs another house speciality the kebabs were tender smokey and delicious served along with mild flavoured rice grilled tomatoes sunny side up and salad  a perfect platter for 2 people

murg musallam i have had this in many places did not really like it but here it was one of the bests i had in the city though it takes 30 minutes to cook it was worth waiting the whole chicken is stuffed with minced meat and boiled eggs chicken is marinated with many spices and curd mainly cooked very perfectly tender and absolute scrumptious served along with flavoured rice highly recommended and the best murg masallam you will ever find

chicken tikka lababdar scrumptious slightly spicy chicken cooked right to perfect no colors added in the gravy just delicious

nihari gosht i usually do not order mutton gravies from restaurants but i had faith in this palace that they serve good meat as their mutton starters were excellent even from the main course this gravy was scrumptious spicy and mutton cooked perfectly we had these 2 delicious curries with hot butter naans i would recommend these 2 curries a must try

mutton biryani very flavourful meat was perfectly rice grains were of a good quality just that they added a lot of cardamom in it with which the biryani gave a strong flavour tasted pretty good

ended the day with desserts hot shahi tukda and matka firni both tasted delicious they werent too sweet perfect to end our day

outstanding and fantastic experience at hyderabadi daawat one of the places to serve authentic hyderabadi cuisine no colors and preservatives hope this place will never disappoint it was worth travelling 25 km is to visit this place the staff was humble and took good care of us",5,
"hyderabadi daawat as the name suggests has some authentic hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in hyderabad ever been to a hyderabadi daawat before no not the hotel we are talking about a function well if you have been to one then you definitely know how much a hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the menu and here at hyderabadi daawat the restaurant you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy the hotel is very easy to locate its on the main roadwhile coming from orr or gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you are coming from miyapur side then it will be on your left the restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors very calm and cozy place they also have banquet hall and a conference hall and they also undertake catering orders for parties and functions and after the dastar was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the yakhni shorba shorba is nothing but the soup yakhni shorba is a dish from kashmirpeople in the north tend to have it more and it is a very good source of protein usually it is mild in spice level but at hyderabadi daawat owing to the spice cravings of hyderabadis it was made a little spicy but the taste was fantastic it was the best way to start off your meal next came the starters in which we were served the wok tossed chicken phuket fish sikandari raan and murgh sholay kebab let is start with what we loved the most the sikandari raan  it is one whole leg from the goat or sheep you know for a fact that mutton and beefs are not usually as tender as chicken but the chefs at hyderabadi daawat changed this notion entirely the mutton from the raan was soo soft tender and juicy that your teeth has no work to docause it just melts and talking about the spicesit was very mild in spice and very well marinated coming to the significance of the name sikandari raan most of you must be knowing that alexander the great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as sikandar e azam after winning one of the battles in 300 bc at takshila he took the ruler called porus as captive and when porus was asked what he wanted he told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo alexander or sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this raan was signature dish and since then it is named as sikandari raan well we think no other name would have justified the size and taste of this dish better than sikandari raan a must must have for you all highly recommended dish if you are here  the next best starter was the phuket fish it is a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions ginger garlic paste and tossed in soya and chilli sauce the taste was of another level next we had the wok tossed chicken wok tossed is an east asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming the taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew soo we recommend the chef to look into that and next came the murgh sholay kebab it was the barbeque styled chicken very nicely marinated and tender to eat and the presentation was amazingly done  after we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called chelo kebab it was extremely well presented chelo kebab is an iranian dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs the chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour after this the main course was started in which we were served the chicken lababdar nihari gosht and murgh musallam with butter naan nihari gosht was love  it was not like the usual nihari that you eat on a regular basis it was different and very thick and spicy and the mutton which they used was really tender do try this dish here chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo  murgh musallam was completely different here when compared to the murgh musallam we had at other places here they serve the murgh musallam with rice and the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs you should definitely try this dish  we were done with all this but how can you even think that a hyderabadi daawat would end without the hyderabadi biryani we had the mutton biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions the aroma of the ghee added to the taste of the biryani  and the daawat came to an end with the desserts you commonly find in a hyderabadi daawatmatka firni and double ka meetha double ka meetha is the very usual dish you see in the functions of hyderabad it is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added and at hyderabadi daawat it was perfectly made and was served hot  overall the lunch here was a terrific experience and we all just loved it and also a special mention to the owner of this place who is a very kind hearted and a humble person he speaks to you related anything and everything you have to ask or tell and takes the feedback whether good or bad with a smile way to go sir ",5,
"this place is only a few months old it is true that hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines mainly there are n number of cafe is bars food joints the new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture
hyderabadi daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends
it excells in real flavours used in hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes
starting with the mocktails section there is a huge variety from the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones the signature mocktails and a must try outs are mango bloom soda fountain and strawberry mojito
coming to the starters it is the best to begin with some soup yakhni shorba is the best try out soup
phucket fish wok tossed chicken and sholay kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu sikandari raan the signature item from the menu is the show stealer the presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately
heading to the main course hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani this place has amazing mutton biryani which is flavoured so well the aroma is literally breathtaking chicken tikka lababdar and nihari ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan the main maincourse is murg massalam a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs this dish was superb in taste as well as presentation after a full on meal desserts are a must matka firni and double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal
the staff here is very polite and friendly the ambience is serene and calmgoes well while having your meal here the place has a huge space of sitting area the indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling
overall its a place you can go to with your family for an amazing lunch or dinner most recommended",4,
just average  i had paya shor a from this place and must its not worth you can have it alongside rice or roti but not all alone like a soup they gave 2 small pieces infact very small and the quantity also too less utne mei kya hoga infact payashorba is an absolute waste from here completely disappointed i have given 2 stars just for the packaging well it was neat rest all i do not prefer to have from this restaurant again,2,
"review is for delivery only
ordered dum la murg asifi with roti and nan
little disappointed with quantity of curry was too less but the taste made it worth the quantity it was fantastic thick rich creamy gravy with almond paste absolutely blown away by the taste only if quantity was improved it would have been a perfect 5",4,
one of the finest dining experience i have ever had absolutely loved the food and staff were very courteous and they really do their job every well,5,
"probably i am having a bad experience with hyderabad food these days so i thought of ordering from a 4 restaurant to be sure

ordered masala kulcha they definitely dont know what a kulcha is and what masala is it was a tandoori roti with a little carrot dressing how can they charge 50 rs for that above all this it was slightly over burnt and had no butter

surely not ordering from this place again",1,
i ordered biryani from this place biryani was very dry rice did not have any taste without salan it was not possible to eat the biryani major part of the rice was white without masala,3,
visited hyderabadi daawat along with 8 friends for dinner surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations the ambience service food were really gr8 was really happy to dine at this hidden gem ordered paya shorba which was deliciously made succulent paya with equally tasty shorba for starters we ordered murgh ke sholay phuket fish rounakhi sheekh kebabs every item was a revelation gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item for mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce it being a persian dish rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs perfect and the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be wondered why we have not visited this place before a definite must visit from me keep it up team hd you rock,4,
"looking at the overall rating  the close promixity to our office visited this place for lunch along with my team today looks like this place is mainly for it people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches  12 nothing great to say about the interiors ambiance it is decent enough i am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food

veg not that great we ordered panneer tikka  palak sheek kebab for starters sabzi nawabi handi  butter naan for mains panneer is rubbery  not soft indicating it is not fresh palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste  not cooked properly as suggested by the staff we opted for sabzi nawabi handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good service wise they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well

non veg sikendari raan is a standout dish whereas the other murg musallam is bland with no tastespiceness to it same is the case with yakhni shorba which tasted like hot gravy water

overall i would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service",3,
"ordered chicken biryani from this place last night and it was delivered within 45 min with good packing

coming to the food biryani was not upto the mark rice was quite plain and do not have masala however it looks amazing but lacks the flavour there is one thing called less masala or spices but rice here was actually more on the bland side rice quality was superb but taste was missing which usually hyderabadi biryani have mirch ka salan was decent so as the raita chicken pieces were having some masala and spices but somewhere some of the pieces were little raw from inside and not completely cooked when eaten with mirch ka salan and pieces then only there was little bit of taste otherwise it was not decent enough also ordered from zomato on special prices otherwise the price tag which they have is high did not found this biryani value for money",2,

"ordered navratan pulao sabz sheek kebab and 250ml colddrink for 545 rupees and review is based on that
quality 55 the food was awesome great taste just they should have given some raita or chutney with pulao eventually i was bored of eating pulao it was less spicy and more sweet
quantity 35  the quantity of pulao was good but sabz sheek kebab was very costly just ten piece for 260 rupees is too much
value for money 45 the quantity was less still it could be considered valuable as the food was very tasty but the cold drink mrp was 20 and they gave it for double price dont know if they added some thing in colddrink from there end that they charged double
overall is recommended if you eat less and have extra money to spend",4,

"i am a huge fan of regional cuisines the diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range india possess it also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it is just a festival of flavors cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the nizams rayalseema to telugu cuisines

hyderabadi dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of nizams from slow cooked raans to delicious biryanis the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and i was really excited to go for it

as i went in for a dinner we started with a serving of a traditional yakhni shorba a great start to the meal with every sip the intense flavor starts to get you then there was an array of appetizers that really got me we had the achaari paneer tikka where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix for the non vegetarians we had murgh kalmi kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix the gosht seekh kebab was wonderful as well it was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the patrani fish the fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste

the restaurant also took the pain to present us their special sikandari rann where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor it was served on a bed of fried onions garlic with some mutton shami kebabs on the side every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day moreover there were also some persian chelo kebabs and murgh mussallum for us to enjoy served along with their range of condiments

 the rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us we had gosht masala achari chicken and nargisi kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot stuffed kulchas and flaky garlic naans the nargisi kofta was my favourite of the night it just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it the gosht masala was spicy but the achari chicken was incredible too desserts like gilefirdaus and fruit salad marked the end of our meal

in a nutshell the true culture and authentic flavors of hyderabad is being exhibited here so hyderabadi dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list go give them a visit",4,
"people say there is nothing called veg biriyani but daawat serves you the best veg biriyani in hyderabad been here 3 times in a month and all the time the taste was same the mixture of rice is masala is very perfect

"the place was in the list when my friends told about that the ambience is awesome everything about the place is design to give a wow feeling
coming to the food part  food is very tasty finger licking the portion size is also good enough",5,
"ask anyone what you like about hyderabad the most the answer is always food hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in india irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors but where to eat in hyderabad as an ardent foodie i get this question asked all the time so to my nonhyderabadi friends i have always been recommending legendary irani restaurants for biryani and or any hyderabadi dish because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes

but that has changed now thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population now a corporate techie does not have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic biryani the legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them in the last 57 years some oldest names have made a neverbefore effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the cyberabad area

one such new entrant is hyderabadi dawat it is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine and its evident in their authentic hyderabadi food

hyderabadi daawat is located at gachibowlikondapur road it is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance just how hyderabadis like it the menu as expected looks as if taken straight out of a nawabi hyderabadi wedding reception

we were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening we started with a mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker

 the starters started with achari paneer tikka which was surprisingly good though not their forte it had perfect taste and softness the veg shami was another great starter the only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected

then came the first nonveg starter the murgh kalmi kebab chicken thighs marinated and then chargrilled to perfection it had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee it was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken

then came seekh kebab something i am very critical about because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors but this one at hyderabadi daawat made me feel like home it had the perfect hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent had a proper seekh kebab after a long time

tandoori jhinga was just good nothing great but then no flaws either

their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies

the first one was the sikandari raan a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then chargrilled and topped with dry fruits it was one hell of a royal dish but the meat could have been cooked more in fact to a falloffthebone level

the second khaas peshkash was chelo kebab platter a persian delicacy that consists of rice a seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter this dish was so beautifully plated we did not want to disturb it and just keep clicking it nevertheless the kebab was soft succulent and full of flavours not very spicy though

finally it was time for the king of them all the murgh musallam a mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat boiled eggs then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled it is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor see the pics and decide for yourself

that was our nawabi hyderabadi daawat at this royal restaurant

i am glad the hyderabadi cuisine is now going fine dine

take my word hyderabadi daawat serves authentic hyderabadi food",5,
"awesome foodfound hidden traditional hyderabadi food at gachibowlilove to go repeatedly for the awesome taste and splendid interiorhad mutton dum biryani with original aroma of spicesvery nice place to gokeep it up guys
you have taste only the requirement is publicity",5,
"went for a casual with my roomie to this place the ambience was nice and looked like a good restaurant ordered chicken shorba which is similar to soup prepared in chicken stew and pepper for starters ordered tandoori murgh adraki it was served hot and really delightful the taste was awesome and chicken was properly tandoored in the same course we ordered the usual tandoori roti and murg tikka lababdar murg tikka was awesome it was not too spicy nor too blunt it was perfect gravy with boneless chicken

only word of advice for the management is please stop applying gst on products sold at mrp such as cold drinks and water bottles gst should not be calculated on those products

we have gone for veg buffet and the starters were not sufficient for even 4 or 5 people no starters were served even after an hour taste wasnt good at all of any item not worth any penny,1,
very delicious,5,
nice little place for lunch parties we were almost 100 people and went for lunch buffet the ambiance is okayish nothing to write about but seating arrangement is quite spacious coming to food we were served with 3 starters chicken malai kebab chicken lollipop and apollo fish all of three were awesome also the vegetarian ones also tasted nice did not try main course much as i was enough but there were enough varieties in chicken mutton and prawn in desert there was one kheer and one gil a firdoos really well made overall a pleasant experience,4,

"we had murgh musallam and it is really awesome the gravy which is prepared is super tasty  chicken was cooked well and tender  if you are a chicken lover can try atleast once the quantity is enough for 2 precheck with them for the availability of the dish before you order

suggestion for team is to add little more rice to the dish",4,
visited this place today we ordered murgh kalmi kebab tawa fish  chk dum biryani kalmi kebab is good fish is a bit smelly and the taste is average we liked the biriyani very much it took more time to prepare the food and the service is very good,4,
food quality is good and hygienic but they dont provide more gravy and raita onions for biryani  need to improve  food orders packing and serving to customers,4,
paid a visit on the occasion of diwali the serving manager was very courteous and humble he suggested some good starters and we finally picked up veg garlic sticks shorba is a must try dal makhni with roomali roti is heaven double ka meetha was way too meetha overall the preparation is sumptuous and pocket friendly must visit,4,
i am a crazy eater this is the best among the best restaurant very beautiful ambiance and so is the food and service highly recommend this restaurant spoke to them they have party hall and party orders i will host my next party here,5,
food does not taste good  zomato delivers spoiled food and they take days long to resolve it  agent has to be assigned he has to take over the issue and then escalate all shit process goes on,1,
"say no more

food  the name itself will get any hyderabadis taste buds jiggle and certainly it stood up to it is name the food here was delectable

i will list out my favorites first in the starters i just fell in love with the murgh kalmi kebab chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture it was delicious and it is a musttry on my list i jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical likewise yakhni shorba indianized mutton soup was a great way to get things started it had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job sabz ki shaami a mashed vegetable mixture fried in oil served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter paneer achari kebab was not the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this otherwise the flavor is pretty good gosht sheekh kebab a classic the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender felt it was a bit dry though patrani fish wrapped inside a banana i am guessing leaf was topped with a layer of mint chutney although the fish was heavenly i would love it to be served without the layering of the chutney tandoori jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second musttry starter

the drinks got mixed reactions well 60 of them being below average and another 40 being extraordinary it was a rollercoaster in this dept we gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us cinderella caramel mint mojito and mint cooler which just blew us all away i hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well

the main course had us dying we were already so full and there was plenty of food left gosht achari murgh achari the former being a lil more spicier were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans there is nothing better than this combination nargisi kofta was another curry could not differentiate much when compared to the other two

special mention goes to sikendari raan for 1490 it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides if you are a lamb lover then it is something that will satisfy all your mutton cravings food gets a solid 1010 need to work on the drinks though

ambiance  it is a huge property just opposite to sln terminus with ground and first floor seating it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once although the place is well lit i did not feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture hyderabadi daawat should incorporate anything and everything hyderabad has to offer in it is culture as nobody else in that area are doing that i had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic lungi have marfa hyderabadi band baaja outside on the weekends but the classy interiors just do not allow this to happen well you never know i am not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy ambiance gets 810

service  it was decent as they are pretty fresh in the market they will have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste the food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then i would like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order the waiters butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have overall service gets 810

why hyderabadi daawat authentic

will i specially go to hd sometimes ",4,
"it is always good to see restaurants which focus on hyderabadi cuisine since it is so diverse and encompasses a lot of different varieties within it hyderabadi daawat does justice to it is name but treating us to good hyderabadi food

the restaurant is located on the gachibowli  kondapur mainroad with convenient parking the interiors are classy and comfortable

the dish that started off the daawat was the yakhni shorbha which was meticulously done  spicy meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone
achari paneer  seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection
sabz ki shami  the textures felt a little strange to me
tandoori aaloo soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exterior
murgh kalmi kebab  marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor
gosht seekh kebab it is extremely easy to dry out a seekh kebab but they nail it here
patrani fish and tandoori jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste
their main course comprised of murgh mussalam nargisi kofta achari murgh shahi paneer dal akbari gosht masala
their sikandari raan and murgh mussalam deserve a special mention
a variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the lemon mint cooler cinderella  slightly on the sweeter side and coco baliney
their service was exceptional where the minutest details were taken care of",4,
"the name is a giveaway here this place specialises in hyderabadi cusinie and we were here for a food review session
ambience decent with ample space it is a fine dine place you can visit with your family
food this place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian my review revolves around their veg food and beverages

the food was well prepared and presented overall i liked the achari paneer tikka in starters shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti basket two of my favourite beverages from the evening were caramel mojito and lemon mint

the menu is vast and really reasonable do not miss this place if you like hyderabadi cusinie even if you are not a fan do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates

"i have always been a fan of regional cuisines of india for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition and its not just the flavours on the taste buds its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization and with the imprint nizams have left on the city of hyderabad in every aspect it does not even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in hyderabadi cuisine

hyderabadi dawaat is one new joint in gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity from slow cooked raans to delicious biryanis the menu for the place is full of culinary delights

coming to the food i went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional yakhni shorba which was a flavourpumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal with every sip the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue

then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg from the vegetarian ones i personally loved the achaari paneer tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it from the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the murgh kalmi kebab  chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection gosht seekh kebab  plain old mutton kebabs with juicy succulent mutton mince and patrani fish  fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor

from among the specialties from the area the restaurant presented us with their sikandari rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves cinnamon pepper and cashew nut finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some mutton shami kebabs on the side each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage  tender juicy and delicious in a similar fashion restaurant also serves specialty big platters like chelo kebabs which is a persion styled serving of mutton and chicken kebabs on a bed of saffron rice and murg mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender served again on a bed of rice

even after the rann the show was not over and we went in for mains trying out their gosht masala achari chicken and nargisi kofta all of which went really well with some hot stuffed kulchas and flaky garlic naans nargisi kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy oniontomato gravy gosht masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the kofta and had flavourful bonein mutton pieces with the achari chicken the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish was not too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be gilefirdaus and fruit salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good

the service here at hyderabadi dawaat was just as good as their food the staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates i was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best in a nutshell if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of hyderabad on a plate hyderabadi dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list

instagramcom",4,
being a big foodie myself i would say this is the best fine dine place for all types of cuisines the ambience and hospitality is great to match up to it is delicious food there are two exclusive dishes over here which were sikendari raan and murg musallam and i have to say that those dishes will keep you wanting to come back to this restaurant again and again,5,
"so the place is named as hyderabadi daawat is actually not just hyderabadi food they have turned this up to a multi cuisne serving hyderabadi  mughlai  oriental and a bit of continental we though here were just to try the mughlai  a bit of hyderabadi and a little north indian style of food lets check them out hyderabadfoodexplorer letsexplorehyderabad

"hyderabadi cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the traditions like any other cuisine generations after generation the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such but there is more than just biryani and kebabs once you get to taste real authentic dishes you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of nizams you always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies wait no more as kondapurgachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while hyderabadi daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebabs and biryani 

my dinner session today had no expectations from it but then the food spoke for itself restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you do not get that easily anywhere in vicinity

dishes like murghmussalam  murghkalmikebab chelokebab patranifish goshtmasala sikanderraan and many more while a few dishes went amiss to excite me all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that is used to typical tandoorkebabs 

must try  acharichicken goshtmasala kalmikebab paneerachari dalakbari and nargasikofta

do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and i am sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich hyderabadi daawat cuisine i am definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service mainly mr dilawar was so gracious

"a newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a sunday afternoon we landed

a quick confirmation via zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff

menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier earned a 12 star

ordered pathargosht and afghan kebab as wanted to start off light as surprising as it can be the afghan kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities pathargosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth another star earned for starters

when in hyd go for biryani so how could not we as we ordered biryanis  chicken and mutton prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time 

taste was good as they took care that the biryani do not fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing the colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the typical hyderabadi style

with tummies full we ordered blue mojito and it too scored as expectedamazing time for a wrap up as the manager mr dilawar greeted us with his hospitality a true gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout

my view an amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with family and friends located conveniently in main road to gachibowli daawat is a must try if you are around or visiting hyd when in daawat do not forget to try their pathargosht and not to forget the amazing raan they boast of being their super speciality

the restaurant ambiance was really spacious and cozy but the food was not so good the starter veg kabab platter the paneer was really hard only the aloo was good we directly went for veg and chicken biryani which was okay but not so good to the service was good i forgot to mention the mocktails that were mojito and ginger peach they were a bit to sweet,2,
"a newly opened daawat restaurant on kondapur road we visited on saturday evening without prior booking the decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting

we ordered mojito and ginger peach mocktails along with daawat khas veg kebab platter mocktails were good but little too sweet veg platter was good but nothing excellent paneer particularly was not so fresh we directly went for veg and chicken dum biryanis again both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary

overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich you can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families",3,
"my husband and i visited zega for their dimsum festival and we were not disappointed
the service started with a delicious bowl of thukpa which had a perfect blend of spice followed by an array of dimsums each being delicious and warm the chicken gyoza was absolutely mind blowing i could eat a zillion of those
the dimsums which we were full after were followed by the main course which included fried ricesoft noodle with chicken and fishwe did not try the vegetarian dishes
the cherry on the cake was the dessert toffee banana with ice cream ugh delicious
our bill was  1700 for 2

"zega is a beautiful pan asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of sheraton hyderabad the restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic pan asian dishes that one could ask for

i went there for their ongoing dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall the dimsum food festival had a variety of thukpa options ranging from chicken mutton pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from china next up there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts

the first thing to try out was their chicken thukpa it was simply delicious the broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet spice and tang into it which was amazing the amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall it was an absolute winner this was something i personally recommend all of you to try

next up we were offered some of their dimsums the showstopper of the day were pan fried chicken gyoza pok choi roasted garlic and napa cabbage crystals prawn crystal wraps and vegetable beijing dumpling the prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try

for mains we ordered for wok tossed chicken in dry chilli cashews crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side vegetable fried rice and vegetable wok tossed soft noodles the chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful it was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef overall the main course was good and had clean authentic flavors

with out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached we decided to go ahead with their toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream this was magical i have been a lover of toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing the creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate

all in all it is a place to sit back relax and enjoy a great layout of pan asian food the staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing happy eating ",4,
it is been a very long desire to taste the pan asian food at zega very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request taste of the food was just ok need to relook into the clasic dishes over all it was a very average dining experience at zega,2,
"was on vacation in shareton hyderabad 18 04 2019 went to zega special occasion on my birthday  ambience was stirringdim light soft music gloomy  we were in celebration mood we requested to taste wine before selecting  one

we ordered thai curry red chicken for main course it was coconut milk curry paste had taste of lime grassbasil some veggie like baby corn beans also used having ting of sweetnessserved with little portion of rice just for one person if your tummy is empty thai curry tasted nicecooked very well

beautiful ambience and great views since this is located at the 10th floor of the sheraton hyderabad hotel food is extremely tasty buttergarliclime crisp fish and classic kung pao chicken with steamed rice were our favourites the staff are very polite and give good suggestions which suit your food palate definitely worth a visit,5,
"it was an ipl sunday evening when we went to this place the food tastes really good unlike other 45 star hotel restaurants where food is average ambience was just ok as it was too dull according to me the highlight of this place is its open till late night 2 am and has an amazing roof top
we order 1 veg and 3 non veg starters and all were perfectly done specially mention for butter garlic fish if u like buttery flavour which was just superb
the only thing which i did not like was the portion size which was too less
and yes you get booze served here even on dry days ",4,
"crazy place with crazy people mad over drinks  a place that is open late in night to havve after party scenes rooftop has a great feeling of its own ambiance is awesome its a party place with great music 
cheers rakshita nath",5,
i had visited zega on weekdays for lunch few times earlier and felt underwhelmed overall last visit for a sunday dinner changed the perception however first of all the ambiance comes alive in the night with a lounge like feel and even the otherwise boring corporate concrete jungle around seems better in the night from a height i am guessing they put their best efforts on a weekend compared to weekdays as the food quality was significantly better food order was two varieties of veg sushis the crispy one was very well made soft noodles and a coconut based thai curry which was neither too sweet nor heavy on the stomach very well made overall and the place was quite packed as well making it lively overall worth visiting,4,
excellent food fast n efficient service grilled pork belly was the best sushi will be memorable can not wait to visit again to try the sushi platter,4,
night life and saturday weekend parties are fun after long busy schedule when it is time for weekend i would suggest my frnds to go to sheraton gachubowli and party all night ambience is gud all the staff and bartenders are respectful and polite and it is my regular hangout location with my frnds,5,

was waiting for longtime to be zega with the rating it possesed bb zega mojitoherbal delightoriental fantasy  blushing dragon were ok but not that great chilli chicken fish paneer were also of subtle taste the lamb starter should have been more soft  in eatable consistency egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt veg thai curry was ok to some extent diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste schezwan veg fried rice was below average somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the servicedisappointing for the price paid and the food we had,3,
i come here often wonderful food lovely ambiance and most amazing staff try their lotus stem appetiser we take red curry for our main course and i love their basil martini their bartender makes it amazingly well special kudos to kyn and pradipto for their most welcoming smiles and their attention to detail they really make our dining experience awesome we will come again,5,

"i have visited this place located on the tenth floor of sheraton hotel for a sunday lunch at 3 pm should i say the service was slightly ignorant they seemed taken aback by having to serve me at that point of time
anyways
the hotel is magnificent and provides a beautifully view of the city if seated in a right place
chicken gyoza was rightfully bland 35
california uramaki  great as always  45
japanese minced prawns  chicken skallion and butter skewers  was impressed by the name but not so mouth watering and very bland 35
everything tasted better with he side chutneys",4,
this luxurious restaurant is located in one of the most posh areas of hyderabad situated on the 10th floor of sheraton the extravaganza starts right from its entrance unlike it is location it is not too economical neither expensive to skint you out of money the ambiance is subtle dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness the menu is sorted right from starters to main course to desserts we ordered slowly cooked lamb freshly prepared chicken and shrimp these were from the chef is menu not a highly preferred place however you can visit for the experience of high end hospitality,5,
"the dining experience at zega was truly splendid every item we ordered was excellent and the stir fried prawns in chef is special sauce in particular deserves a special mention but what set this place apart from almost every other restaurant was the service provided by arjun and kuldeep which can only be described as exquisite their dedication towards customer service is truly remarkable and praiseworthy

marvellous food along with top notch service provided for one of the best dining experiences till date",5,

this is a fantastic place i rated them 1 star on my first visit they were apologetic invited me again immediately and i did not show up until after 10months because of the traumatic first visit they have upped their standards significantly since best hot and sour soup on par with any chinatown joint across the world  bamboo shoots shiitake mushroom and all the works gyoza is good heck everything they served was good on my second visit special shoutout to the lady who mixes the drinks  a true professional her nirvana cocktail is just that  sinful pleasure i went there on consecutive weekends tip  go during the day because it is well lit and has a wonderful view outside i will be there again cost is very reasonable for the place which is a very pleasant surprise i will be there again for some more of the nirvana potion,5,
"chinese cuisine is a comfort food for me and the chef quickly noticed this after a quich talk with him i curse myself for not remembering his name now
chef prepared a special chicken fried rice for me as i was not in a mood to order from their menu and it was pure magic i also ordered the dimsums which recalled me my darjeeling trip",5,

i have been to this place long back with one of my friend never though of writing a review about my visit but when i came across couple of pictures which were captured there made me to write this i would rate this place 45 for food beacuse the fried rice that we have ordered though it was tasty it is oily for the service this would deserve 55 because from the time i have entered i was heartfully welcomed by the hostess and was shown a proper place for seating and the bar man was so interactive with us which actually misses in other bars when i have to write about the ambience this place deserves a bow ambience inside the bar is awesome but the ambience from the rooftop would be mind blowing would love to go there again and again,5,

but if you are a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this

dj plays some really nice music

great ambiance and food hostess barnali is awsm she had helping us in choosing the food and she is so caring overall a wonderful experience,5,
would not like to even give 1 as service was pathetic staff was appearing to be busy and had no courtesy to attend our table in the centre of the restaurant starters were served after main dish though they were ordered much before one of the staff half served a dish to a couple of guests on our table and hopped to other table without finishing her task without any apology we had to keep on asking for a dish sushi which was ordered 90 mins before it was served noisy place,1,
table was not clean and there were stains on it obviously not a 5 start standard food was ok ok not something great with limited variety on menu service was below average as they were not prompt i had to wait every time to get something served on the plate or need to call them and ask to serve on a whole the experience was very poor nothing great when i visited with my wife for dinner,2,
"great place good music and late night hours wanna party after 11pm  zega is the place

"there are places that deserve a 5 star but they are worth a single visit this one is different the restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits the food taste and quality exceeded the expectations the presentation was great nice and courteous waiting with quick service

however the security of the hotel sheraton in which this marvellous diner was in did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called zega also there is no elevator from the underground parking space

it was a 5 star experience for the restaurant the ambience and the food but i cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance

anyway it is a must visit i apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5 but i really had no choice based on the inconvenience at the entrance",4,
wow zega you people are best in city rock ice innovations in cocktails attract me all the time thank you so much for giving me surprise all the time,5,
if there is one place where one can get good food excellent service a beautiful ambience without the snootyness of a 5 star it would be zega we visit this place often esp at night pradeepto the bartender is v creative and makes some excellent drinksbased on your preferences in addition to what is on the menu definitely worth a try,5,
"favorite place
a very good placeto hangout with a late night bar
staffs here are really amazing helpful an very friendly food are delicious",5,
we have been here a few times and quite like the pan asian fare the service is also prompt the view of the financial district is great especially in the evening so go for window seating,4,
nice place it is in 10th floor love it have very less options for indian cuisine had tasty dimsums and chicken chilli as starters wish there was some live music on weekdays,4,
a very modern restaurant with excellent ambience service food and music they take hospitality to the next level by treating every customer like a king no restaurant even comes close to this nothing to complaint really so 5 stars to them,5,
love this place  there food is great  good place to hangout after 1200 am midnight roof top is so peaceful at night i will visit this place again in future,4,
we went for a family dinner on 15th april being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 78 min whereas in any other 5 star a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry however we went inside and opted for a buffet the food spread was very good however few of them were coldroast chkn and fish tikka the fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert the most annoying thing was the on the table service the table wasnt ready when we were seated we had to ask for napkin spoon fork and even for a glass of water multiple times the empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean the taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star,3,
"went to zega for our first wedding anniversarythoroughly loved it the staff is super friendly and the food and drinks were amazing
special shoutout to the cocktails tasty as hell
definitely going back here again",5,
"zega is just the right place if you are a fan of asian food
i keep asking for the kimchi 
nothing can go wrong with your order here just feel free and order whatever your heart permits and your tongue ask for it
everyone offers you great service especially kirti the pretty girl in her suit i hope am recalling her name correctly
namaste from aditi ",5,
had been there for lunch on a friday afternoon they have a very cosy atmosphere with a wonderful view of the gachibowli road from atop the 10th floor their food was something that we thoroughly enjoyed we had their awesome tyangra style hakka fired prawns which was sweet and mildly spicy there were about 6 chunky prawns in a plate their maki salmon sushi was great as well if not the best then we had the chinese barbecue pork belly ribs which was chunky succulent and juicy in short we had a really great meal and look forward to a second visit there soon,4,
beautiful place to hangout with friends and best thing about this place is amazing food and their great service and killer view from roof top,5,
"great place to dine the sushis are awesome and the ambience is the best you can get dj plays some nice tracks staff is corteous deepak helped me in selecting the cocktail believe me nirvana is the best zega cocktail

great place to hangout with friends some of the best asian food you can get in this area i really like the kung pao chicken and their signature lamb chops cost is a little on the higher side but well worth it,4,
"nice place for a dinner date
food is good ambience is good service is good

tried thai taste was good was not click worthy no complaints though",4,
"this place might be good but it is the worst now ordered a chicken keema paratha and got some vegetarian paratha instead
not only was the order incorrect but it was burnt
zomato refused to help on the issue",1,
"a very nice option for paranthas lovers with so many different options the taste is quite good and i love that they provide option to customise each combo so that we can select any combination of paranthas the packing is also really nice totally worth it to have 5 star ",5,
i wish i could have given you a 0 rating the wheat used to made the pranthas did not seem fresh also the green chutney was stinking the paranthas are too dry to be eaten alone except packaging nothing went well,1,
not cooked properly no paneer in paratha,1,
i have ordered chicken shawarma paratha which was smelling worst and tasting bitter money and hunger both went in vain never order food from this place,1,
i ordered the combo of aloo paratha and paneer paratha i really like the quality and quantity that they give in one serving along with the curd green chutney and pickle and a small butter it is really a wholesome and flavorful meal for a person if you are craving for some home style paratas this is a really good place,4,
good ambience great food well i would say best parathas out there in the area served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can not as only one will fill you tummy comes in great packaging if you order online 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time so less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need,5,
my whole order was wrong moreover i received burnt parathas in the order zomato refused to issue refund for my order this is really inconvenient and disappointing,1,
"the parathas actually tastes like an authentic north indian dish  not a big fan of spicy food but liked the parathas a lot for ppl like me who prefer low spice food shall make a special mention ",4,
"ordered garlic cheese paratha and got live cockroach as accompaniment though i got full refund but that is not the solution
triptify is service is getting worse day by day
anyways it was my last order from triptify",1,
food used to be good but live cockroach came out of the food for the second time just apologies from customer service representative is not the enough quality control has to be talen seriously till then no triptify adios,1,
i have ordered two parathas paneer paratha was fine but gobi paratha was over roasted and not edible at all attached pic of over roasted paratha i think rastaurant should take care of this during cooking,1,
"i ordered parathas from this place and i just loved them
alloo and paneer parathas were very good though corn paratha was average in taste
i really liked their garlic chutney",4,
worste quality got hair on the food,1,
mexican corn parantha was rubbish,3,
"not the good onei ordered chicken keema and chicken cheese prantha from the bestseller list the stuffing was lessand the prantha was not soft it was heavy in quantity and very hard no taste in stuffing no salt no spice
what i liked from the triptify is the packaging  no offence  genuine and honest feedback ",1,
great guy and good service and on time delivery,5,
i found dead cockroach in food it ruined everything hygiene needs to be improved a lot cant guarantee about food quality sometimes food is extra salty,1,
"one of the few joints  who specialises in paranthas ordered paneer paranthas and cheese corn paranthas paneer paranthas was awesome and had a very good evenly distributed stuffingthier chutney  which comes with paranthas  enhances the overall flavourskeep up the awesomeness guys ",5,
delicious as always typical punjabi flavour,5,
too spicy parathas  though they were good but they can make it less spicier it would be better,3,
amazing tastealways likeable vareity of paranthas and combos is another advantage pf this place it feels like homely food which makes your mood refreshing,5,
"ordered gobi paratha and aloo paratha
getting used to small parathas delivered we were wondering they would do the same and ordered two items for two people
to our surprise we found the best parathasbiggermore quality and more tastier ones
the packaging is very good and the add ons they provide are too good
truly in love with their parathas",4,
great parathas their food packaging is exquisite do try the chicken and cheese parathas one of the best however corn and cheese aaloo chilly garlic parathas are delicious too,4,
stuffing not upto the mark,3,
as tasted before all good,5,
"always a delight ordering from this place 

the packaging is just so good you get pickle chutney curd and butter with the parathas

i have tried paneer tadka paneer aloo punjabi aloo capsicum corn cheese capsicum chilli cheese
the paneer and cheese options are really yum the parathas are served hot and heavy they are quite filling as the stuffing is pretty amazing

do try them for a laid back sunday lunch for a hearty meal ",4,
"this has become a favourite place to have parathas they serve an excellent quality with ample quantity of food fully paisa wasool place

i ordered paneer and aloo paratha thinking that small paratha will be delivered but what a pleasant surprise two monster size of parathas of each flavour were delivered packing was perfect and it reached my home hot and fresh both the types of parathas were really crumptious even the green chutney they serve with this was awesome those who have complained about less stuffing inside paratha should definitely try this for sure you will not be disappointed undoubtedly full marks to the food

"today i ordered some paratha from this place delivery was on time and packaging was really good

one of the best places quite possibly the best in parathas i hear 13 dhaba and parathas and more to be better in this areai have tried them all and there is no other rather than this i will order i am the biggest fan of alloo and gobi paratha and this restaurant would know i order every 2 or 3 rd day the same usual deal of both above parathas they are delicious absolutely perfect packaging just the way we like it superb delivery time everything perfect do not change be this way,5,
yummy parathai tried a lot of paratha from different places but first time i got the complete north indian tasteneed more chutney next time and no curd,5,
always used to have a craving for chicken parathas we were randomly looking for a place to serve our hunger when we found this one small and a neat place we ordered chicken kheema paratha and butter chicken paratha the taste was so goood will come back here for sure the chutney given as a combo was yum as well cutting one star for the ambience food wise you will love it for sure,4,
"i had heard a lot about this place and their amazing paranthas so i decided to try myself i had ordered the combo of punjabi aloo parantha and cheese corn parantha i loved the food packaging the chutney dahi and pickles came is separate containers and the parantha were packed so well and were piping hot
coming over to the taste i would say i loved it the aloo parantha was excellent the corn cheese parantha was good too but i could not find any cheese in that parantha i guess i would never order corn and cheese parantha again but i would love to try other paranthas by triptify and wpuld definitely recommend others to try this place",4,
ausum parathas good packing faster delivery go for cheese onion capsicum paratha and punjaabi aloo paratha the great one 2 parathas are much heavy for a single person size of parathas is huge and stuffing is really yum seves with pickle butter green chutney and curd this time i didnt get pickle but thats okthe parathas were yum,4,
loved the paranthas and the presentation the delivery was prompt the chutney got spilled but the taste made up for the inconvenience thank you,5,

i ordered paneer paratha combo expecting to get something really delicious but what i received did not meet my expectations the paratha was abundantly stuffed but it is taste was not that good also it was way too thick,3,
it is not goodearlier it was good but today food is not good,2,

"ordered food recently from this place
i think the biggest disappointment while ordering a stuffed paratha would be less stuffing but here is a big thumps up to these people coz evrytime we ordered parathas from here the quality and quantity was maintained",5,
one of my regular food ordering place and added advantage fast delivery cause nearby location they offer high quality stuffed parathas with curd butter and two different chutneys their mexican corn and paneer tadaka are my favorites would recommend this place if you wanna try delicious parathas,4,
food is too oily and chutney is too saltypaneer is not cooked wellraw smell of ginger garlic in paneer parataparata is too denseneed to improve the quality of food,1,
"so i happened to order aloo parathas and mountain dew full marks for packaging and the way they serve you 2 big fat aloo parathas  just the way they should be with pickles butter dhania chutney and curd they actually kept the punjabi paratha feel alive so thank you for doing total justice to the food you serve
a small complaint would be adding more aloo and not make the dough too thick but overall it was wonderful and just like a true punjabi i even burped thrice after having this meal paisa vasool",5,
well served,5,
the food was not at all good i have ordered chicken keema paratha and the chicken was not fresh it was smelling like any thing bad experience with the restaurant,1,
ordered gobi and sattoo paratha as lunch from here this came with dahi  butter  pickle and chutney gobi paratha was soft and flavoured and sattoo paratha stuffing was too much and i dint like the taste much as i could not get the exact flavour of it the packing of this was excellent which came in a box packing using aluminum foil covering for paratha and every other thing well settled in the box overall it was okay with the accompaniments and more than sufficient for one person,3,
"got cheese combo parathas home delivered for lunch i had chosen aalu cheese and garlic cheese options the packaging was really compact and well done the parathas were very yummy and cheesy and went really well with the accompaniments they provided which constituted curd dhaniya chutney butter and pickle
i would highly recommend this place to satiate paratha cravings",4,
"oh my my what great parathas these guys know their game when it comes to parathas

the corn and cheese parathas are brilliant  their sides blend so perfectly with the parathas brilliant packaging too",5,

it is overrated casual chinese food with lot of oil you can call it more of indian chinese ordered wolly chicken average flat noodles very oily thread chicken was oily the captainmanager denied us axis bank card discount because it was not told before no restaurant denied me that discount before quantity is too much and they charged more than what was mentioned in the menu seriously it is an overated indian chinese restaurant one star is for the thread chicken starter oily fried,1,
overrated place it is a disappointment and below par as per taste we had panok prawns you could taste the batter it is basically the deep fried prawns however the taste is not at al upto the mark schewan noddles and chicken garlic sauce is below par nothing great about the place,2,
it is an good place to try out casual chinese dining must try their royal thai prawn soup i got captivated with the flavour of that other things in the menu was good too but could be better service was fast and the place is quite peaceful to enjoy a meal,4,
"we love chinese food and we headed for chinese pavilion to have dinner on a wednesday evening we reached there by 730 and we were the first customers by 830 onwards people started to fill the restaurant it is not difficult to find the place since is on the main road

ambiance is nice the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing decors have chinese items so it is not bad

service was spot on we were attended very it did not take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen

for food we had satay chicken sticks and spicy black bean lamb for starters teppan soba noodles sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts the satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth really good the lamb was good but not wow the noodles tasted awesome it came sizzling buttery and full of flavour usually in india is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience the prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely recommend

although not a big chinese cuisine fan but this place makes you love this cuisine as much as other of your favourite ones service is amazing with very friendly staff i ordered veg manchow soup veg mini dragon rolls in appetiser and in main course water chestnut baby corn broccoli wholly sauce curry with veg fried rice everything was freshly cooked and tasted perfect only thing to work upon was veg mini dragon rolls which were bit too oily and do not forget to try their non alcoholic beer,5,
"kinda of disappointed with the food everything is either drenched in oil or tastes old ambience is quiet butter garlic prawn is good though

dishes tried
butter garlic prawn
roasted lamb
crab on toast",1,
for the first time in my life someone justified to me that burnt noodle tastes as such because the item is a sizzler  regards to the rest please confirm if it is crab or crab meat if it is crab meat  please stay off,2,
very fast service and the food is delicious everyone must try the restaurant is food really loved the food very tasty authentic chinese dishes,5,
"i am from mumbai i ordered it from my hotel in hitech city from swiggy
i ordered chicken pot rice pot rice is usually wet n not dry this one was actually dry and it was not made with the wet gravy how pot rice is actually made and they made chinesee like biryani seriously garam masala in the pot rice was a big turn off
it was actually hydrabadi pot rice lol",1,
i have been to this place in weekend it is really great i had vegetarian food only which include hakka noodles manchow soup and veg szechuan fried rice everything tastes perfect i have never tasted such perfect blend of flavors in any other hyderabad chinese restaurant,5,
the tofu with mushrooms was absolutely wonderful  enjoyed the meal and grateful such establishments that do not modify perapartions for the indian palate exist in hyderabad,5,
i used to love chinese pavilion the banjara hills outlet was synonymous with prawns in chilli oyster sauce i went with those drool filled expectations to the gachibowli outlet for takeout and could barely finish the fried rice prawns in chilli plum sauce felt plasticy sigh,1,
"such good place for chinese food

ambience nice and peaceful

taste very good i had lemon grass soup since i had a sore throat and it helped me more than i wished for lemon coriander and chillies have all added to the flavors the crispy water chestnut starter is sweet but tasty i could not stop myself from finishing the sweet coriander sauce that had a hint of mint
teppan soba noodles a sizzler is just as good all in all a happy experience

will i visit again yes

cost effectiveness average about 700 for a person

experience enhancers the staff who are well aware of how the food is made very nice service",4,
been to this place twice for dinner and have not been disappointed we ordered a lemongrass soup honey potato please lookup exact names in the menu to begin with and proceeded to have veg soft noodles and manchurian the manchurian is not the desi version that you get in most places so the spice levels can be a let down but the noodles were thin and light overall a delicious meal definitely recommend it,4,
"feel good place to dine with your family and friends along with having amazing chinese food and desserts especially cheesecake
sophisticated ambience
very polite staff
great place for chinese food lovers
elegant decor",5,
i have to chinese pavilion many times and has always a very good experience the ambience is very peaceful and calm the interior is really good and unique they also provide baby chair which has become a must for me i ordered everything veg sweet corn soup veg mini dragon rolls and haka noodles the sweet corn soup was good and thick and tastes delicious with all vegetables he veg mini dragons are mini spring rolls that kind of disappointed me as they were very oily may be it is my personal choice but i wish they are less oily the haka noodles were the best i have had and loved them to the core i gave full points because the staff is very friendly and super courteous and the service was also very good,5,
the food is delicious service is excellent i wish the portions were bigger since most of the dishes are for family style dining my favorite chinese place at gachibowli,5,
we book a table at chinese pavilion as name suggest  they specialized in more of chinese or oriantal cousins food n service was good n fast,4,
"not just the food the service in this place is horrible we ordered crab meat soup which according to the menu was supposed to be spicy
they served us a bland soup and when we enquired about it the captain person who took the order said we should taste the soup first before asking
the captain was disrespectful and dismissive also charged us full price for soup that was unpalatable
needless to say we did not try anything else there",1,
the best place for chinese lover the food is very authentic and the service is bit slow but you can comfortably eat staff is very nice always ask for recommendations from the staff and their choices are simple perfect and that makes a foodie try the best they have in their restaurant,4,
"we have been here on weekend afternoon for lunch as we want to have a authentic chinese nice ambience less crowded  peaceful environment warmly welcomed by staff coming to food as we have kid with us so the dishes we ordered were of less spice ordered some veg soup couple of starters i must say veg soup was made to perfection full marks we did not like starters honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be  babycorn starter has no taste no salt no spice but again main course specially egg fried rice was very nice  tasty could have ordered a bit more spicy one bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored so no complaints over all good experience but spicy levels are far less

"visited this place on a friday evening saw good rating on zomato and decided to give this place a try
this place has great ambience and decent staff we ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good but if you see the attached image to this review the cucumber and salad which i got was not fresh and this had disappointed me you would expect fresh food on your table when you pay premium price
we then ordered garlic based noodles cant remember the name mongolian chicken and lime soda the food was great but again we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed
overall i would say the food was great a bit pricey though i could not give a great rating because of the things mentioned above",2,
this is my favourite neighbourhood chinese restaurant love the jade chicken soup here as well as seafood the staff is courteous fast  love the quiet ambience fragrance decent  less crowded a bit expensive costs around 10001500 for 2 pax place considering the locality but its worth the money,4,

"one of the best chinese restaurants in hyderabad 
love their ambience service and obviously the food 
especially their chicken dry red chilli starter with egg fried rice truly amazing keep up the good work guys",5,
ordered tom yum soup prawns pepper chilli fish crispy ginger very good soup do not understand why u have to use barter prawn ok taste however batter was thick fish crispy ginger chilli very disappointing taste less for main course ordered mandarin fish and chicken fried rice below average food over all ok ok place huge difference in taste when compare to banjara hills outlet,3,
"soups were excellent
satay was ok
chopsuey with white sauce was not great
i would recommend it with schezwan sauce
ambience is just fine",3,
"mediocre food 
ordered wanton soup and chicken dimsum
for a crazy dimsum lover  the dish was unappealing as the outer cover was thick  though the chicken portions were decent  the wanton soup was mediocre
what bothered me was the service personnel hurried his way through the order and mentioned that only main course can be served it was still 15 minutes for the closing time
i just feel some personal touch would have been better
will explore some more dishes  before commenting further",3,
a decent restaurant with courteous staff and mouth watering chinese dishesa good place to go by for chinese cuisinesizzler noodles and bamboo rice is a must try for if you can go with less spice,5,
i have been to this place about 67 times i absolutely love this place all dishes are awesomejade chicken soup is a must try staff is very courteous and knowledgable they will advise you on the quantity correctly waiting time is also apt ambience is also very nice prices are a bit on the higher side although it justifies with its quality,4,
"the place is very well set up with chinese decor and comfortable seating everything on the menu is not great but few things are exceptionally good crispy mushroom is a must try and for sure will be a delight for the vegetarians
i tried the american chopseuy and will not be recommending that to anyone tastes really bad and the quality of ingredients used is just not good although the service staff was very courteous and welcoming also they extended their timings for us but food part needs to be worked upon",4,
i was here last night with 2 of my friends we ordered pan fried noodles chinese pavilion noodles pan fried and spicy black bean lamb food was spicy and tasted fine i have had better pan fried however the bestworst part follows all of us had to take a sick leave today as we cannot stop going to the washroom the food quality needs to be definitely checked we do not expect this from a restaurant of your stature never going back and requesting others the same,1,
went to banjara with a couple of friends then to gachibowli with family wrote a review for banjara just now but wanted to give one for this one was as well food is the same great thing i like the decor more here more modern than the banjara place but same great taste and service,5,

i have been to this place last sunday we ordered soup and some tofu dish soup was awesome but tofu was not good at all i felt the price was little high according to the place,3,
"expensive taste

the chineese cuisine served here has a delightful taste to it the pan fried item is are the best and must try in the menu the pricing is costly one would feel it over priced right from the moment of the first sight of menu overall a family restaurant with good chineese cusine and strictly a no friends hangout place",4,
"been looking for chinese food around gachibowli and found this place 
the staff were very courteous and friendly  the menu also had a variety of veg and non veg dishes to try out the ambience of the restaurant was beautiful with chinese pottery and ceiling was full of ceramic bowls",4,
i am amazed at the quality of food and service this place provides being not too opulent in either ambience or location this is a mighty place that would otherwise go unnoticed but you visit once and you want to go again i liked the taste presentation and cleanliness on both of my visits the service was impeccable highly recommended for good chinese cuisine both veg and nonveg,4,
"the food was amazing do not forget to try mouchi kay there amazing sizzlers and very cordial staff you have got t to taste the dragon chicken as well best on town for chinese ",4.5,
"we ordered from here via swiggy

we ordered

stuffed mushrooms they were a little too sweet yet they tasted great and quantity was great

mushroom in shechuan sauce we ordered this dish but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish we opened it very late after we recieved the order so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer or may be it was tofu i have never tasted tofu before so i can not say but we did not really like it

hakka noodles noodles tasted great really tasty and quantity was really good

fresh lime soda it was really good and refreshing

fried rice it was decent with good amount of veggies quality of rice was good

stir fried greens it was really very tasty good amount of different veggies like broccoli pringle etc
although we were disappointed that there was no mushroom",4,
i have been to this place on a sunday with my friends thinking i can have a good meal and spend time with friends but the moment i arrived there it was around 215pm and the manager there started nagging saying that the kitchen is going to close in next 10 minutes can you please place the order this continued even after we placed the main course around 230 pm too the food tasted good but the nagging was annoying,1,
"saturday afternoon we decided to try out this placei liked the ambience this place had ceiling mostly filled up with ceramic bowls very beautiful

overall it was good to taste in winter evening",3,
"food chinese with a touch of indian masalas enjoyed the taste

service messed up our order brought us a different dish that the one we ordered but on the whole polite courteous and helpful in understanding all those foreign looking chinese dish names

"good ambience courteous staff normally not a rush hour during the afternoons 2nd visit during noon hrs
tried green thai curry great but cld be a little spicy
awesome chicken american chopsuey one of the best in town it is supposed to be on a sweeter side  it is bang on
ginger chicken  fried rice is a good bet as well",4,
"i am a regular to chinese pavilion banjara hills but this was my first visit to gachchibowli  i was disappointed

the place is not bad easy to find valet and comfortable seating service was decent as well

food was outrageous the order was chicken corn  manchow soups which were ok prawns and teriyaki chicken which were decent but the killer was pan fried noodles if you cant make it the way it is supposed to be then why keep it in the menu

vegetables  baby corn brocolli appeared stale and they got a wierd mushroom which was yuckyyy to the core i eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible

stay away from pan fried",2.5,
some restaurant is have figured their identity this is one of them bamboo rice and honey glazed chicken all day ask for the blueberry cheesecake and indulge yourself,5,
"no nonsense interiors add an elegant touch to the ambiance
quick feetfriendly and humble staff make your visit a memorable one
we ordered
jade soupthis could seem a lil bland according to manybut for me spinach broth with sliced garlic was packed with oriental touchfor a change shredded meat in soup was not rubbery

sea wars  this appetizer was blend of fried prawnsfish and squid the chilli soy sauce and sweet coriander sauce served on side added a wonderful touch to this delightful dish

fook chook fried rice white sauce not cream based topped fried rice had a subtle flavorit was loaded with vegetables

honey noodles with ice cream  texture of the noodles here was nothing like the ones i tasted earlierfried noodles had a fudgy texture with went along real well with thick creamy ice cream
fruit punch was decentbut pinacolda has to be improved
i recommend you to visit this place if you enjoy oriental cuisine sparcely infused with indian flavors

chinese pavilion is one of the best oriental restaurants in indira nagar to satisfy your cravings for chinese food the decor is blue and subtle and the blue pottery that ornaments the restaurant is breath taking the food is above average but nothing mind blowing it is a good place to satisfy your food cravings but do not expect something new or out of the world,4,
"never have been disappointed when we have been to the restaurant serves some lovely authentic chinese cuisine the server always at hand to help serve  give some good recommendations

good ambience also keep it up",4.5,
your quest for authentic indo chinese food that tastes great and suits your pocket ends here we went on a weekday and were given good attention by the staff we had the manchow soup and chicken drumsticks for the starters and haka noodles and fried rice for mains and were not disappointed overall a great experience,3.5,
"if its chinese then it is this place  no other place in hyderabad has chinese food this good  well at least till now 
let me start of by complementing the service of this place such a homely and warm feel when each waiter was more than willing to make us comfortable the owner mr ali who himself helped us out in deciding what to order based on our pallet the food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself it was way better than what we wanted
our order came in around 15 min  maybe lesser  and it consisted of crispy lamb noodles sauted in this wonderful butter garlic combination mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce the food was exceptionally good  each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream  the best darsaan i have ever had 
food and service was mind blowing i would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone who wishes to have chinese and yes this place is going to become my second house you will see me here way too often from today",5,
"visited this place along with couple of my harley riders the ambience is superb calm and they were very light music which was soothing for your ears the service was pretty quick and the guys were very decent

"i have been here like 34 times and have tried dragon chicken schezwan chicken noodles  chicken soup spring rollsout of all these schezwan chicken noodles is my favourite
must say one of the best place to have chinese food in city

the ambience is good  but one can face problem with the parking as there is very less space outside the restaurantbut otherwise it is good",4,
lust for authentic chinese food takes me to this place and believe me they never let you down we had chicken sweet corn soup and hot and sour soup tasted great for the main course we had fried rice and a chicken side dish good food coupled with okayish service but compared to the place pricing is steep for sure,3.5,
as soon you enter the restaurant you get an all authentic chinese restaurant feeling quite good in ambiance and the decor is apt to the restaurant is menu the food was absolutely delicious and had authentic chinese flavours we had schezwan sauce based noodles with vegetable manchurian and both of them were absolutely delicious you must visit this place if you love chinese,4,
been here multiple times and good food ambience is unique and classy service is prompt and courteous will recommend highly and definitely come back again,4,
recently visited this place decor is simple yet nice ambiance is okayish with some soothing background music good to focus and enjoy your food however food was average we ordered a rice a noodles and a chicken side dish and all were average,3,
"hello 

this place was bookmarked for a long time now so i wanted to pay it a visit and finally the moment came when i was actually able to go there i am a huge fan of indochinese cuisine and i honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment 

i ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there is no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the chinese food 

wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which werent properly fried and rather than giving a good taste it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering 

all in all the food was not enjoyable 

will i visit again probably not i am sorry 

thanks",3,
really loved the ambience staff was very polite very delicious food served quickly though it was busy but very expensive when compared to other restaurants,4,

good ambience and presentation thai flavor is very authentic i really like the way they cooked tofu we asked for mushroom free food but they gave food with mushroomswhen we informed them they apologized and immediately replaced it which was a good gesture,4,
"i was told by one of my colleague about this place i found it amazing first of all its situated at gachibowli above cafe coffee day the ambience is good but the service quality and quantity of food is amazing we had soup which was good and as a part of starters we had ginger chicken which was really amazing
for main course we had hakka noodles with chicken in spicy black bean sauce and mongolian chicken i must say all of them were really amazing and had a great quantity and quality is beyond words
then in desert we had chocolate mousse and chocolate volcano with vanilla ice cream
mousse was good but the volcano was really really good
i would say a must place to go if you are looking for good chinese food and are bored with mainland china ",4.5,
"one of the finest in chinese restaurants this is a perfect blend of a silent quiet dinner ambience with great food wait till the end to try the desert thats the show stealer ",4.5,
i have tried prawn pepper chili  chinese pavilion special veg noodles fried rice and some other chinese cuisines from here the prawn was very good so was the noodles  though it had a plenty of veggies it was overpriced last time i ordered fried rice which did not taste good plus i found something in the food that made question their hygiene  never going to visit place for that,3,
"chinese pavilion in banjara hills used to be a regular and favourite haunt during my business school days and visiting the gachibowli branch brought back all the right memories the spicy crab soup three treasure vegetables shanghai prawns and yong chicken hit all the right spots and made it one of the best chinese meals i have had in a long long time

chinese pavilion is all set to be a regular haunt again",5,
"restaurant serving a chinese cuisine on gachibowli mehdipatnam road the food is not so great and does not have that authentic taste the dishes they serve are different but fails to impress interms of presentation taste and even price
the ambiance is good and does not have anything which will make you feel wow the restaurant is costly so look at the menu on zomato before you enter the restaurant one of the dishes we took was totally burnt the quantity of food is good compared to other restaurants

foodshaukeen chinesepavilion

chinese pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a chinese restaurant and i wasted no time in suggesting this  visited gachibowli branch which is above ccd and is in the same building of up the bistro
their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably
pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250  350  a tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 ai
have ordered manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds red chilli prawns dry bbq chicken three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers prawns teppan yaki pan fried and tossed along with chilli garlic and butter tasted real good bbq chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish a wonderful combo to your taste buds three treasure veggies had broccoli baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces could have done wonders
among main course was schezwan fried rice and cp special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce tasted okish as sauce did not impress me as much as i expected schezwan rice was delicious though right to the spices requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles 

service  though their service is quick staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order something that is important from customer point of view

bottomline  there were few misses and few hits however most of the dishes were towards sweeter side i wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception",3.5,
chinese authenticity in budget loved everything about the place staff was courteous food was amazing and authentic must try veg manchurian gravy and bamboo rice haka potato was amazing as a starter,4.5,

"it is very over rated on zomato went to check based on the rating and my love for chinese food

went there with friendsthe staff was politehad the royal thai soup vegloved itliked the dumplings but the quantity was just 4 tiny pieceswhich was very less the hakka noodles were decentthe bamboo rice was not as good as i had expected itthe chestnut curry was okayoverall everything was okay nothing was bad,3.5,
"my favorite chinese restaurant in hyderabad food is splendid and its never crowded the waiters are connoisseurs

the royal thai soup is what a soup should be
the roasted lamb with superior sauce tastes great with the pepper sauce
the pan fried noodles will make your day
oh and the chocolate mousse will give you sweet dreams",5,
just went due to the zomato rating small place may be 4045 seater restaurant close to offices has valet parking which most of the small restaurants does not have staff is courteous they have a daily course meals round the week good option instead of buffets every item in the platter is good nothing wrong to point out lighter on pockets go for it with bhaskar varada,4,
amazing foodgood ambience  great servicethis is what describes chinese pavilion their chinese is blended in indian flavors  that is what makes it so special the chopsueyall chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fishprawn starters the best part about their food is it is not blandit is mixed with indian flavors ensuring the chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy if you want to try something different within the chinese cuisine this place will not disappoint you and the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice i am going with a 45 because i beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and i request every foodie to visit this place this is honestly one of the few chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an indian touch worth a visit any day,4.5,
"the food was just average staffs were very nice serving time was also nice the taste of food can be betternwith beyyer cooks comparing the price to the taste its not at all worth

as soup is one of my favorite dishes i started with spicy crab soup
it was good but found something was missing in it
i tried to do some modifications and added sugar and venigar which made it awesome
thai basic chicken fried rice was good not that spicy but i the rice was very dry it might tasted better if it was bit wet

"chinese pavilion in banjara hills was the first chinese restaurant in hyderabad for me and i still have fond memories of the great authentic taste so when i heard that they have opened another restaurant in gachibowli which is near to my home i was excited and took my family to dinner first of all the ambience is a huge let down it looked like any budget restaurant and i was thinking whether i should get out or go in finally went in expecting some great food
we ordered noodles fried rice a lamb dish and a brownie first of all the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience they are providing a 3 experience and asking for 45 prices the fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked the desert was a disaster overall please avoid this restaurant i am not sure what is the condition of their banjara hills branch now but there are far better chinese eateries around gchibowli as well",1.5,

now food  jade chicken soup nice spinach based creamy stuff gud way to start the meal accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good fish cakes were good loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome main course was mix xo rice of chicken and prawn well that was the downer nothing exciting abt it maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then nash fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry desert  blue berry cheesecake so here is where me and wifey differ i thght it was worth it she says the base was not crunchy engh so try and rate yourself

last ambience  was warm n eye soothing

oh and i forgot the orange pekoe tea the best i had in lat few months have it",3,
this place has never disappointed us the food the courteous staff the serene ambience we wanted to have something totally rice free and with very little oil they served us steamed fish with chilly garlic noodles with chicken as always it was awesome thanks chinese pavilion it is always a pleasant experience,4.5,
"bad rating is mainly because of chicken bone found in veg food and is not acceptable for a vegetarian

to satiate cravings for chinese food we headed to chinese pavilion and there was also a voucher available in little app for luncheon tray for rs 310 veg well do not bother for the voucher as the price for veg luncheon tray is rs 275  taxes in the restaurant itself

the ambiance is decent and since it was noon not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite

it was thrusday special veg
hot and sour soup was just ok  well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth something different
kimchi  salad personally i am never fond of it
potato in plum sauce  this was very good and well made
brocolli baby corn mushroom in spicy sauce  this dish lived to its name too spicy but was fine with fried rice
veg hakka noodles  was good
veg fried rice

overall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken bone came into my friend is he is pure vegetarian mouth while eating noodles it was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined
well management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely do not want to visit the place again i requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for vegnonveg cooking which manager declined which makes me believe they do not

staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of veg and nonveg as in indian culture it means a lot

uploaded photos with the bone found",1.5,
"i personally love and prefer chinese food had been here couple of times with my husband

the ambiance of the place is very good the entrance has some carvings and the walls were very nicely decorated the server was very polite
