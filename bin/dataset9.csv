one bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time.",4,Positive
"short review: decent breads and starters, bad shaam savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
better ambience at night... and importantly good quantity!
i wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
extensive...
ambience: it's better at night. friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. so if you prefer ambience, go at night!
food! ordered a hara bhara kebab, shaam savera, daal makhni, rotis and raita (yes! i'm a vegetarian üôà)
the good part! quantity üòç
i was excited to see shaam savera on their menu. but take it from me, you do not want to order it. it is no where close to what it should be. they messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
the daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. it wasn't creamy too :(
the breads and raita were decent!
the hara bhara kebabs were decent too, soft! they had an extra outer coating of peanuts. so if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
conclusion: it looked like they had made food in a hurry.
would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. if things change, you'll know!",3,Neutral

"good ambience and great service.we've had buffet for 25 people.the waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.
shoutout to shubro and pradeep ,took care of our entire afternoon.",4,Positive
"my review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. and now i can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
they're located near the biodiversity signal, above fabindia. there's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. the ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a pdr section.
the menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans continental, chinese and indian cuisines. here's the list of things that i have tried, across all my visits

panko crumbed mozzarella sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - cheese sticks that are coated and fried. pure cheese bliss.
veg lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - this place has one of the good lasagne in the town.
crispy chilli corn kernels - the usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
makhmali paneer tikka -
cottage cheese shashlik sizzler
italian nachos - nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
cheese and cheese pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

i cannot stress enough on how i have loved all that i tried here. i have also tried out their lunch buffet. the variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. but what i really adore here is their mocktails. beyond delight is an absolute delight! also a fan of the guava and chilli, and apple and kiwi night drinks.

the staff is ever so courteous. a special mention to papiya and shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. the place has zomato gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. a meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",4,Positive
had lunch today at beyond flavors .the food was very good and delicious and awesome service was provided by soumen das & shuvro. would highly recommend the restaurant .,5,Positive
the reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. we went on friday afternoon. we waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. we lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.i think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.,3,Neutral

"we went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in zomato.

the spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken biryani.
desserts are ice cream and jamun.

the taste was ok and not to expect too much. little disappointing when starters are not hot.

fish fry was decent, schezwan chicken was ok.
veg spring rolls were too good.
big surprise for me is onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
chicken was ok. biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

for the money we pay, we expect some good food. they use much of colour in food item's.

suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",3,Neutral
the place is just beyond beautiful. ambience is excellent and food is good. the service by soumen das is extremely good. highly recommended place.,4,Positive
"i have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes, it never disappoints.

"discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
but. but, the food turned out to be a saviour. and the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. the lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food.",5,Positive
"second time being here it's really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well. very courteous staff and very hospitile.

"ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour... he may suggest great food as he has good experience. the staters and sizzler was too good. the sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome. nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat.
great experience in beyond flavors.",5,Positive

"we happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked..needless to say the ambience and music was really good .we had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat..they served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good.the buffet spread was one of a kind:
strters : veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.they were lil cold but the taste wad good
non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.chicken was fair enuf.
singapore noodles,egg salad and pasta : they were good but it was cold.
main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer all were equally good
biriyani: egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

the staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.we had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

they could improve the above points to stand better!
overall :3.2",3,Neutral
"good ambience with an absolutely delicious food.
i‚Äôve got best company here by ananya (beyond flavours)
the place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff.
great place for friends.",4,Positive
"i have been at this place for dinner a few days back. the ambience was good. the restaurant was almost half occupied. we immediately got a table. but then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. we ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. only the starters could be served in 30 mins. there was no sign of mock drinks! we noticed similar service issues on other tables. noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

the food was just average. dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on zomato.

we finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",2,Negative
"i have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and i loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
because of the good experience i revisited this place with my sister. she orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. and then i asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. it's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu.",3,Neutral

"i would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. if you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. so basically none of the food we ordered had salt. we ordered fries, panko mozzarella sticks, tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""italian"" nachos. not sure how that was nachos or italian. they basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. the beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. the paneer 65 was horrendous. might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. the only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. all these came up to 1300 and odd. thanks to zomato gold, our price went down. this place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. and talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. they really need to clean up more.",1,Very Negative

food quality and taste is not good. super slow service. nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. lot of items not available even if in the menu.,2,Negative
"this was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. first our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. and the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. we figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. i do not recommend this place at all. there are so many better places in gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.",1,Very Negative

chicken masala : 0.1/5 ... lowest rating possible
chicken biryani: 3/5

"here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in gachibowli area. this colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. this place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. the menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(i don't even remember all the names!!!!

starters are mouth watering (as i write), may it be veg or non veg. to begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. this is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

delicious starters are served on your table. the one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! you can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a master chef certificate üòõ( hoping you may use it in your resume). main course also has some delicacies worth trying. i am not naming any because i was having foodgasm that i hardly cared to read names.

desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
you have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. i had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and pan ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

the ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. you will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

i would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... i believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

section wise ratings:

ambience: 3.5/5
staff: 3.5/5
food: 4/5
buffet items: 4.5/5
overall: 4/5",4,Positive

"hi
this time, we are not satisfied in flechazo.. starters are not much hot.. most of them are room temparature or little warm.. we have asked for fish starter.. we got only two pieces.. bbq wings are not good.. tooo hard... mango chilli prawns not much tasty... only maida coating smell.. no flavour nothing... we are not happy with flechazo, gachibowli...",2,Negative
"wide spread buffet, taste is good too, courteous staff very polite. we had a family dinner there and all of us had a lovely time especially kids love the live counters.",5,Positive
"i‚Äôm not going to this place again. though the ambiance is good, flechazo gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. we went there as a family. the first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. the chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. you find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. another unique practice i noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
the place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. the main course buffet has limited choices too.
but for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive i could write about this place.",1,Very Negative
"the starters were good . especially mutton starter , they are many varieties in chicken then other items .
the ambience is so good and the staff is great .
jayanta service was very good and food was on time. thanks to them .",5,Positive
"flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- the mediterranean and asian. it has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. gol gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the diy concept to the table.

starters: stuffed mushroom is a good option and veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
main course: you will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. leave some space for the pasta though.
dessert: this section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

this place is indeed a foodie's delight.",5,Positive
"visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. booked table through zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (pani puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

desserts was a mix of indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though i am not sure if healthy..

i was surprised with a mother's day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!",5,Positive

"i went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato.

good things first, the service is excellent! the waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.

food: nothing great. as am more of a ""starter"" person , i love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. the sushi and pani puri were very okay-ish type
main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. taste of the food was very normal.
in dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

ambience: the place was jammed packed even for a tuesday lunch. couldn't enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter.

all in all a very okay-ish lunch!",3,Neutral

ambiance: 4
food :3

there were many items on list but taste was not so good.

don't be fooled by word unlimited beverages. only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you can't choose the flavour.

totally felt disappointed by taste but customer service was good.",3,Neutral
"good place to hang out with friends , the panipuri on the conveyer belt and making your own pizza are the main highlights for this place....",5,Positive
"oh i had so much hope on this place looking at the descriptions and all, but this just turned out to be an imitator of abs, may be with few concept changes here and there. ok the food is fine and all but it's just the expectation of being different.",3,Neutral
an decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters. the place was crowdy even on a week day. servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying. but the finger food on conveyor belt was cold. the pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment. couldn‚Äôt get to main course but the spread seemed interesting. would love to visit again.,4,Positive

"4 stars:
pros:
1.variety of starters
2.option to make pizza,pasta by your own hands
3.good biryani in main course(a rareity now a days!!!)
4.atleast 8 items in desert(the jalebi was specifically good)
5.staff behaviour

cons:
1.only one soft-drink avialiable,for every day one flavour,so if you are unlucky u have to drink orange juice if you go on tuesday even if u dont like it
2.no hard drinks available

overall a very nice experience, go and enjoy!!!",4,Positive
"i absolutely loved this place. let me begin how comfortable this place is. the sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. we were served with welcome drinks. few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. for a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. for vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. the mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. the food was also good. in sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. even try pan ice cream.
the staff here is courteous and friendly as well.
overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.",5,Positive
loved the food here especially baby potato in harissa and sweet chilli barbeque prawn is must try in starters and smoked paan ice is just wow. mini pizza and pasta is also good here.thankew sabir for your awesome service and helping us pick d best one. had a good dining üòÄ,5,Positive

the fish served as a part of starters was the best i had eaten in a very long time.
mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.
the service is good and the staff is courteous too.
but sadly, despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end, they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide. this was disappointing and could have been avoided.",4,Positive

ambience is awesome especially faijul service is good and friendly :) it is a good place for team outing.. overall we had a good experience and fun,5,Positive
it is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. my friend and i had come with great expectations. but the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. the chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. the starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. in spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. then in aglio olio they used macaroni. the main course had a terrible array of dishes. and none was good. the biriyani had no chicken. the couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. the chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. all in all a very forgettable experience. however to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.,2,Negative
"i visited flechazo today with my family. the ambiance is very pleasant. the service provided by ranjit and ramjan was excellent. food was nice we have several options for starters, especially i liked fish starters very much. main course is also very good. coming to desserts i love the ice cream they made on the spot. this provides several food options in all starters, main and desserts. one the best place to try with family.",5,Positive

tolichowki is the main branch for shah ghouse.",3,Neutral
used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city. to my dismay i ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12pm. tastewise it seemed average but as i was hungry i finished it fast. fell asleep at 2am to wake up at 5am with a severe upset stomach. this went on and when i woke up by 10am my stomach still hurt. i'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. would recommend a place called cafe 555. their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.,5,Positive
"food is good, but for the second time around they didn't send us our complete order. had ordered 4 naans, got only 2. also got daal tadka instead of daal makhani. not sure if its the ramadaan rush, but now twice in a row our online orders thru zomato have been messed up. probably will avoid going forward.",2,Negative

biryani was oily,3,Neutral
"i heard haleem will be so good, etc etc but taste is not that great as others said. just boiled the meat and grinded like paste. nothing special in it",1,Very Negative
"it‚Äôs a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems; shah ghouse.
tip: ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me, it tastes much better. we also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious.",4,Positive
"always the best... the taste of the biryani is so unique that i can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's shah ghouse biryani....

i deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. not pointing towards any specific scenario but i would prefer ordering online from shah ghouse than going there and eating, specially when i am late.

the quality sets it apart from its competition. it is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime ...

i judge a restaurant by its consistency and shah ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality.",4,Positive

"the place to have one of the best biryani‚Äôs in hyderabad. chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome. the food is hygenic and well cooked. chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try. veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at time.

"i have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and i have never been so upset. of course i have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which i ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. yet another incident today where my order was wrong. you can check with my name what i ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th may'19.

hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes i wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. they deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. guess zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right.",1,Very Negative

i suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant(shah ghouse gachibowli)

"i visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on zomato. though the restaurant claims to be authentic original hyderabadi taste the gachibowli branch was open in 2015. given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. it looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
so for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete no...
food was okay we ordered apollo fish starter which was very hard. and spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and paradise or pista house has better taste than it. quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. and it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.

and
apollo fish (the plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

jumbo pack biryani - this delicious biryani is the one to die for. arguably, one of the best hyderabadi biryani, it is served with egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

tandoori family platter: rs. 1300/-
apollo fish: rs. 240/-
jumbo pack biryani: rs.600/-

the likelihood of finding a parking spot during weekends is slim to none.",5,Positive
one of the best biryani restaurant in hyderabad. kebabs and other mughlai dishes are also delicious. highly recommended for all non-veg lovers!,5,Positive
"visited this place on 24 march,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. we went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! such is popularity of this place! lets find out, how the experience was.

ambiance

=========

its a multistoried restaurant. and every floor was full to the brim, with several biriyani crazy people! we got seated at the second floor. the floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. the seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. ratings - 3.5/5.

service

=========

the waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. he paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. overall service was fine. ratings - 4/5.

food

=========

here comes the big deal. lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""family pack"" chicken biriyani along with reshmi kebab and ginger chicken for starters. the starters arrived and they looked yum! the reshmi kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . the kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. the ginger chicken was tasty as well. must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. then came the ""family pack"" biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). the biriyani, here has a very different taste here. its not that spicy but its delicious! no wonder, this place is so famous! ratings - 4.5/5.

value for money

============

all these food, for just thousand bucks! need i say more. pisa vasool. ratings - 5/5.

lets calculate,

rating = (ambiance + service + food + vfm)/4 = 4.25

final thoughts

=============

if you are in hyderabad and looking for biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! highly recommended!",4,Positive

not worth for money. 1star from my side",1,Very Negative
"if trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... this place is a must visit . it's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. one of their best beer would be the otm lager. for starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when i say it's one of the best vegetarian starters i had in a while . the lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. the sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. i would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. the chicken tikka was one of the best tikkas i had. the meat was tender and perfectly cooked.the mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.
if you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ... this would be the perfect place.",4,Positive

"decent place. we went there on a saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. we ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. we couldn't eat anything more! also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. decent enough. also wanted to try the moonlit one. but were sad to know that it wasn't available. service was the best over all things said above! mr sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! the sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. so, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

"actually i struggled between 3 and 4 for this place, where drinks are so good and buffet doesn't last to it. but a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. a little costly. caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though. finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive",4,Positive

"ambience of the place is amazing with good music. they have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. all options are good. book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. hospitality of the place is also very good. they serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.

apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer i have ever tasted. the alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. must to try at this place. froscher is another good brewed beer.

veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. it was served with three different kinds of dips. one of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all north indian food lovers. though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of north india. the best starter was burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. it was extremely good in taste.

"special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare. dinner last night at fisherman‚Äôs wharf was one such memorable experience. spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. we choose to sit in one of the mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.

now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best i have had in recent times. chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  

sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. the setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us. after redemption of the zomato gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child",5,Positive

"on a sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. so the first name that came to my find was ""fisherman's wharf"". on my last trip to goa, i had the opportunity to visit their outlet near mobor beach(south goa). i won't say that i had an awesome food experience, but i was blown away by their ambiance! although they have opened an outlet in hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. so on sunday 19th may, 2019, it was time for redemption. we visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, i could figure out that it was a full house!

ambiance
===========
at the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""panjim"" restaurant. we would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all i could say was that place was lively! the ambiance may not be as good as their south goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! ratings - 4/5.

service
===========
as we were seated indoors at the ""panjim"" restaurant, himanshu was in-charge of our table. he was polite , courteous and efficient.  he was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. top-notch! ratings - 5/5.

food
===========
ta-da, here comes the big deal! my wife had prawn curry rice and i had fish and chips.   the prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and goan spices and tasted yum!  it was served with steamed rice. for the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. it was served with tarter dip! i was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in hyderabad, is a pure bliss! ratings - 4.5/5.

value for money
=============
hmm, its a very important point! is the food served, worth the price? absolutely yes! my bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and i am not complaining! ratings - 4/5.

lets calculate,

rating = (ambiance + service + food + vfm)/4 = 4.375

final thoughts

============= 
if you love live music, goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! probably one of the best place to chill out in hyderabad.",4,Positive
visited this place about a month ago and they weren't very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out asap. they were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food. tried the fish&chips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent.,2,Negative
"one of the best fine dining restaurant in hyderabad . superb ambiance and great service. i personally loved the place and the way they treat .

tried spring roll, tempura squid ,drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. fish tasted awesome. overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and dak bungalow chicken. pulao could have been better. one more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. better to have a reservation during weekends.

ambiance--5/5

taste--4/5

quality and quantity --4/5

service--5/5

presentation--4/5",4,Positive
food is great here. surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. their staff is very coordial too. live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. i believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer.,5,Positive
"great ambiance, its a theme from goa but i'd say its better than goa itself.
the food was amazing, the service was great, and everything was organized.
my favorite dish out of all would be their pasta.

would definitely love to visit again.",5,Positive
"goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. great place to chill all around the day. the price is a bit on the higher side.
ordered zafrani paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
tried thai green chicken curry with jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. loved the thao curry.
they offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. had the best long island ice tea till date.
all in all a great experience.",4,Positive
"i have been there with my family. mainly the ambiance and appetizers are just amazing.
another main asset of the restaurant is the way there are presenting the food.",5,Positive
"excellent ambience, great food and service... there starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. the main course is above average. that's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. they have different sections both open and covered and named under goan beaches. they have a fresh catch section, from where you can choose fishes, crabs and lobsters and ask them to prepare it.",5,Positive
"goan food at its best! this place is as good as it's sister outlet in goa. mimicking the goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.

the food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. the southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! great lighting and courteous staff.

tried the south indian fish curry and rice. probably not the best i've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.

must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)

would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!",4,Positive

"good for a nice sunday brunch. the buffet for two is 1500 inr, and worth the deal, i'd say. the ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options. would recommend.",5,Positive
"this place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. we had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.mushroom tonak and mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. it is the place if u want to try goan cuisine.",5,Positive
"perfect place for corporate dine outs. had a great time with my team dinner. wide variety of goan dishes and other food as well as ""beverages"". a bit expensive but ok. the private space was good at 'margarita lounge'",5,Positive

"ya i started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.this hotel is famous for sea food.thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in india too.i felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.this hotel gave a goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.the waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.

"this place is really good n relaxing because of the ambiance.. loved the place, food was good.. it‚Äôs worth giving a try. live music is an add on to this",4,Positive
went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet. the place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either ac or outside. because of the heat we went inside. the starters and soup were served on the table. there were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. the waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome. next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience.,4,Positive

"the ambience of this place is amazing. as the place is usually away from the city there's a sense of calm. wanted to try seafood in hyderabad and i guess this was the best place available.

"been to this place couple of times but finally found time to share my review.
great ambience with tasty food, more of the chicken was delicious and juicy.
one should also try the fries of this place.

loose prwans was good. crispy chilly pork so yummy .service is good",5,Positive
bad for a sunday lunch..the place might be good for evening ambiance but afternoon inside the closed..most ordinary rooms with no music.. just chatter of other guests is a mood spoiler. extremely slow service. food is tasty and that's the only reason one could visit the place.,2,Negative
all kind of food is good here wrt al a carte. go for famous dishes here e.g. crispy chicken. not a disappointment for experimenting either. dish of the day was not up to the mark sometimes. pricey for regular visits.,5,Positive
"absolutely loved this place. highly recommended.

food: delicious. exotic. hygienic. we tried lobster, prawns and red wine. we wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available. maybe they should keep the menu items in stock. you may not get all the items listed. 10/10

ambiance: beautiful. live music. great lightening. for parties and a nice dinner. 8/10

service: satisfied. they prepare food just like you would like it, asking for instructions. waiters were polite and nice. they served us cake as we went for birthday celebration. it was just a pastry but still nice gesture. 8/10",5,Positive
the ambience tells everything. the place reminds of goa. the must place for dinner. the food is tasty and they should try the goan delicacies.,5,Positive

"#6packfoodie goes the fisherman's wharf!

food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
ambience: 5/5
courtesy and staff: 1/5
zomato gold experience: 1/5

when we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. i booked the table for 2 with seat preference as outdoor seating. the issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". if this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. disappointed.

finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. moving on lets go to food.

ambience: the entire olace has goan vibe to it. the area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. the sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in goa.

drinks: liit, one of the best liits i had in hyderabad. the lime mint juice was also tasty.

food: ordered beef chilly fry. the tenderness of the meat was perfect. spice level, presentation was worth the price. they have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, pomfret. we had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. the spice balance was fantastic.

now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

the guy who served us didn't come with the bill. another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. which means you have to pay for everything!!!

this was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

we had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

if potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. if you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in hyderabad, then thumbs up.

sea food lovers this is the place for you amidst all the hills in hyderabad.
tawa fry fish is a must try.
service is fantastic.
music is mostly great.
ambience is hands down a winner and good food along with a perfect mix of cocktails.
goan style dishes would take your taste buds literally to goa.
special occasions like diwali and holi are also welcomed here like home.
family or friends fits in good for both.
finding a place in the weekend could be time taking so recommend to pre book a table.",5,Positive

you don't need to give a second thought to the ambience at all... its perfect for a date or a group...

friendly staff...

food is awesome veg as well as nonveg...

must try... chilli paneer , nachos, fried rice , chilli chicken, prawn

this is on the list for a long time and checked it off. well it‚Äôs an goan themed restaurant and they nailed the whole decor. coming to food we went at 5:30 pm so not much of a choice in menu. so ordered fish fingers and chicken starter, both turned out good. will definitely try again.",4,Positive
"the place is open seating, gives a good airy feeling. music is good and it had occupancy on a week day.

we ordered catch of the day lobster & pomfret, fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. the star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like palak paneer at the first but had a distinct goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

nice place, i would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!",5,Positive
"this has become my go to place now. we went on a sunday evening, and really had a very good time with some delicious food and the band performing was also very nice. we ordered stuffed crab and i would say it is a must try dish. it was just mouth melting. in main course we had goan prawn curry and rice and it was good. they also have fresh catch counter where you select and customize your sea food",4,Positive

"went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 

during lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. we took an outside seating. 

ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. accompanied with butter naan.

the nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. the chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. the chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. we really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

overall, the dishes were a must try. with a large menu and varieties, i know i'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

in the beginning it was great place to dine. then it started getting local. fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..not so great.
now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
we ordered mutton xacuti and kingfish richado.
fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
mutton was out of the world, with heaps of curry leaves(kadi patta/karia paku) , super high on heat....reminded me of a rayala curry in dindi (godavari distt ). meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. i really thank myself for not ordering more.
fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment.",1,Very Negative
"nice ambience and live band we have been visited with our family delicious food and nice cocktails had enjoyment time with nice sea food verites we like fish starter with spices and indian main course the service was nice by ashish, komal and zamir..the cocktails taste good and boozy. we all are happily enjoyed with our family.",5,Positive
"i had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night, while we were driving along the financial district road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work. as we entered the place, i was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. the place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. the food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. i would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you goa trips.",5,Positive
i went to this place with 7 friends. the ambience is really nice. the staff are polite n friendly. we had good time here. food is really nice .,5,Positive
"surprisingly well versed ambience. the place is massive with a get-away-from-city feel. they serve wonderfully cooked seafoods(goan focused). a tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. i would recommend, to book table before hand; there are variety of sit outs to choose from. i would highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre a seafood lover.",4,Positive

"perfect for date nights!!!

beautiful place, with great food and amazing cocktails. especially there raspberry liit's. great options for both vegetarian and non vegetarians. you can order anything from the menu and i can assure you it will be great. the only set back is the service. really slow, just place your order in one go.",4,Positive
been the place for lunch and i loved the ambiance over there which resembles the same as goa and the person who loves sea food will be attracted to this place ..,4,Positive

sea food cravings. close your eyes and reach this place in hyderabad. a very wide spread variety of sea food. can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. i have always been here for the love for 2 things. crabs and only crabs. it is a must try speciality of the restaurant. the goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied. thats the fun of it. ambience awesome . staff too good. feels homely. love this restaurant more than anything. 5/5 for everything.,5,Positive
"a must visit for sea food lovers, brings in goa to hyderabad. would love to see more seating arrangements in the open area. great food and lovely ambience. a must visit !! don't miss out on the simple yet amazing fish curry rice.",4,Positive
"ambience is really good. lot of space, laid back ambience, mist sprays - perfect for a lazy sunday lunch! coming to food, recommend trying only goan cuisine. didn‚Äôt feel the buffet was special or so but their ala carte is real good. sea devil is a starter that stands out - prawns wrapped in beacon, perfectly grilled. butter garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side. goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice - chicken vindalho if you are looking for spicy or chicken xacuti if you want something less hot!",5,Positive
"great ambience, great food! i would recommend the pan seared fish üëå
it's a little outside the city but the rooftop seating makes up for it.",5,Positive
"visited this place on saturday evening.
had stuffed crab , fish starter, chicken in goan style ( was very spicy),stuffed chicken.

in drinks we had bull frog, drink was strong and tasted good

"till now ordered chef's special veg thali, oat meal, parantha in super breakfast
pros
# calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
# taste, quality are great

now i felt few things can be improved
# delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# price and quantity ratio : i felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
eg: oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140. 
 i strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20% so that they can get more orders and new customers to",4,Positive
"great food. no oil, soft rotis, tasty gravy and juicy chicken. it's a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals.",5,Positive

service was real quick comprising both order acceptence and delivery.

i ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for zomato to deliver. zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but i am never going to order from this restaurant. also the food was below average. i ordered tofu keema roll.,1,Very Negative
ordered a wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset. the quality of food seemed really bad that time. although i tried reaching out to zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eat.fit team will get back. till date i haven't received any response from either zomato or eat.fit,1,Very Negative
hey guys!! i ordered chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasn't a good experience at all...the only plus point can be given for good packaging. but packaging doesn't count as we pay for good food. the biryani didn't even taste like a biryani. it was more like fried rice with chicken dumped. üò£ had a very bad experience...,1,Very Negative

"for the first time tried the light lunch meal from eat.fit which has 450kcal (as mentioned).

decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in hyderabad. a less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. not sure if i would order this again, but could maybe try their salads.",3,Neutral
"why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry. unless the buyers are fools.
terrible pricing and quantity for the money.
2 stars just for decent taste of curry.
all those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can‚Äôt have sufficient food inside.

"we ordered 1 luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees. the taste was okay. strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani. but i haven't had lucknow biryani before, so can't really judge how it exactly supposed to taste.",3,Neutral
ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. by bread omelette i was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. omelette tasted good. bread was plain and hard. there were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. it tasted ok. along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. english style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. this was a major let down. there was rajma type curry which tasted ok. this whole dish was out of the way.,2,Negative
delivery boy was reluctant to the deliver the order and was unable to navigate the maps. he reached to different location and when i was trying to navigate him he said he don‚Äôt know the address which was mentioned,1,Very Negative

"ordered the breakfast combo from zomato. the taste was good and simple. feels just like home made food and healthy too. the breakfast combo had a bread/bun, omelette, grilled tomato and side(curry kinda ) for the bun.",3,Neutral
i ordered from this place from zomato. the amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant. i ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes. the juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml. the potato flakes nothing more than normal haldiram mixture. i am definitely not ordering next time.,1,Very Negative

well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.

so i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their chicken keem paratha wrap. its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. it tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus.

yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. but yes, a nice concept though!",3,Neutral

pomegranate protect was simply amazing. one can feel raw pomegranate, coconut juice. satisfied with quantity for both items(bought on zomato offer)",4,Positive
"fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing. surprisingly it's not what typical oatmeal bowls are. oats, soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear, apple, pomegranate, dates and mint leaves. superb taste enough for a person.
all eatfit drinks/juices are amazing and so was guava glow. could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon. the pepper was unidentifiable in juice.",5,Positive
less quantity,5,Positive

would recommend dal chawal. the sweet they as complimentary are really good. should try to reduce plastic use in packaging as they are heavy on it due to marketing stunts",4,Positive

"ordered chicken thali for two from here. loved the effort they put in packaging and attaching printed labels of your name to the food.
a wholesome meal for two, it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each, daal, chicken gravy, raita, salad, pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar.
a healthy alternative to oustide food if you're working out . enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well.",4,Positive
not valued for money,4,Positive
"i strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories. i would suggest eat.fit to look after the quantity,because i think it's very little with this price tag. apart from this everything is extraordinary like packing ,presentation,quality etc...all the best eat.fit.",4,Positive
"i have ordered kachori & chana chaat for home delivery from zomato. i was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eat.fit ( previously ordered food quality being good). as soon as i opened the box bad smell was coming, then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori's. the chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori's were also smelling bad. i had to throw away everything. i don't think i can order again with trust on their food quality.",1,Very Negative
"dates tea cake was good. i was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates. it was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier.
topped with chia seeds, the lemon tea cake was surprising as i could feel cinnamon. it was slightly oily. at first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake.
these cakes are wheat based just as described which is a good thing.though the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes, i wish it could've been more just as shown in cult fit website.",3,Neutral

if there's one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong, it has to be eat.fit outlets.

if you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free, tasty and with great packing it has to be this place.

eat.fit provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.

"everybody is talking about eat fit these days! i was curious to know what's causing so much buzz? so, i ordered chef's special veg thali.it contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!

i really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. it was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. the paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.

but i would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. the cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.

overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. you get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. you can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.

it's great to see that people are so health conscious now. eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution. hope they keep inspiring us :)",4,Positive

"avoid. this place is a scam. if there is even a place: i cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address. anyway, i ordered a healthy chicken breast dish. they claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. the only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. no wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. there were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. i doubt it was even grilled. it looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. the picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. i should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but i was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. at least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.",1,Very Negative

the food was amazingly delicious. i ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive. they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious. the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious.,5,Positive
"i wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around gachibowli. i did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. this was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in india. few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 

1) they do not use any processed ingredients 
2) they do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( that's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) they use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4) no maida no sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5) daily cooking (they cook a limited number of portions )
and there are various other reasons as well 

the calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the indian meals are very tasty especially their no cream dal makhni, nilgiri chicken, hyderabadi chicken, mangalorean chicken, kashmiri chicken, tawa subzi, paneer gravy in chefs special veg thali to mention a few. not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. the healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, wheat chicken momos, chicken baida roti are filling. these help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.

the only downside for me is that it's a zomato exclusive and zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. they promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. by the time food arrives, it's already cold which i hate personally. this happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. the algorithm being used by zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against zomato. they have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on zomato exclusivity many customers are disappointed

taste 4.5/5
packaging 4/5
vfm 4.5/5
overall 4.5/5
zomato delivery - 1/5",4,Positive

"ordered the paneer-dal combo for 2 people. it comes well packed in a big box. the quantity of the food is great! 3 chapatis for a person, raita, dal makhni, paneer, salad, pickle and super food supplement. we also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake. so in terms of quantity a 5/5. coming to the taste - the paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty. dal was decent, probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind, wasnt high on spices or oil. the curd was fresh and good in taste as well! loved the over all parcel!",5,Positive
"dear eat.fit , what on earth charging you 180/- ? for this 3 rotis, 2 spoons of veg curry, enough dal and little salad with spoon of raita
i am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness.

3 star is for taste and quality. but quantity doesn't even meet expectations.
very poor",3,Neutral
"i ordered from eat.fit and sorry to say the food was at all not good. both taste and quantity were below my expectations.
the food i ordered was masala egg curry with vegetable pulao with order id: 1676056120

zomato delivery guy when delivered i realized that curry was spilling from the box. when enquired he said this is packaging problem.
after zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eat.fit seems to be not bothered. 
after opening the box the food was just half a bowl. rice taste seems to be of very low quality. bad service from eat.it and from zomato.

my first and last order from eat.fit. already uninstalled zomato . overall very unpleasant experience.",1,Very Negative
quality of food and packing is good.. quantity is less in the bowl.. my advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity won't be sufficient for an individual.,5,Positive
"great food came up with neatly packed and the delivery person was handled the package with care and delivered on time, thanks to zomato to be a partner with this kind of great restaurant around us. eat.fit is unbelievable and marvellous food making and packing",5,Positive
"this restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web page
and after a long hard work i found one contact through zomato customer service .....which was also wrong
this shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurant
they have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact number
moreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from them

poor show

i would give a half star

horrible experience with eat.fit",1,Very Negative
"ambience:na

dal makhani is chatpat no other flavour. parata were pure wheat made but they were hard when i received. sweet was not good at all but mix of sounf, sesame....

"i ordered their special chicken shawarma from zomato. first look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. the quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.it is not at all good. the chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. it usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.the quality needs to improve a lot.
stay healthy. keep eating..not from here.

super taste and packing was nice. this is one of my favourite food. and we had with friends everyone gave same rating. we enjoyed a lot. thanks zomato,5,Positive
i bought food from them twice. rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma. both were good and tasty. i liked the libby shawarma more and the rumali was also good but libby better. the rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern i had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. i should have given instructions. the taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. totally; i am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.,5,Positive
"delivery review :

ordered a chicken rumali shawarma.

the chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

overall it was okayish.

had to throw away half of it as both rumali and the chicken were very chewy.

giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city.",2,Negative

"had tried chicken shawarma, lukmi, samosa, veg puff, egg and chicken puff.
chicken shawarma, was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok. it tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark. overall didn't meet my expectations.

both lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation, just the shape was different. better to go for samosa instead of lukmi, the taste was ok though.

comming to the puffs, all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery. not a big fan of these.",3,Neutral

"every foodie i met in hyderabad recommended this shawarma. i had just started loving the one from istah's, but i'm up for a new challenge. my friend ordered one and we shared. it was awesome. it was spicy and tasty. then, i ordered one myself, but i ordered the one with salad. what a slap in the face. i came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). the rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. nevertheless, i liked the shawarma. it's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
edit 1: yesterday i went to shah ghouse again. i really wanted to try the special shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. to be honest, i was blown. it's the best shawarma i've ever had. the meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. i relished every single bite. take a bow, shah ghouse!",4,Positive

lot of crowd and filled with online orders. delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. amidst all this rush, i ordered for a special rumali chicken shawarma for rs 120. got it in a jiffy and i haven't had much shawarmas before.
 
this was absolutely delicious and filled with chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. i guess i checked out the reviews here beforehand and i told them to make it less spicy. don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  a somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack.",4,Positive

really succulent chicken, sweet, flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti. this is a full-sized dinner-replacement wrap that's bang-on with the flavours. the only shawarma in the twin-cities worth craving for. do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life, let it be this and thank me later.
p.s. the chicken is on the spicier side though.",5,Positive

"visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and i must say! one of the best places to party in and around kondapur. the place is huge and divided into 3 sections. interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
if you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. my favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
when it comes to food.
first dish was :
green veg galouti : mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). the kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 achari daal croquette : achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with panko crumbs and deep fried. and the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
moong daal cheese chilla : minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. it was decent.
chole bathure : the chutney was so good. served with potato curry.
 galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and mutton galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
had few mocktails but my pick was kiwi based mocktail. full marks for the presentations.
chicken tikka: this can never go wrong. it was very good.
chicken taco : will make it simple. just loved it.
heard alot about desserts. next visit will be desserts. will keep you posted friends :)
over all the experience was good. interior might not be the best looking one, still looks decent but the balcony i must say. fell in love with that area.",4,Positive

# specifics
party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb dj...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...of course cricket is worshipped in india...but a big screen for ipl (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# food

#honeychilliwings .... # chillychicken
the former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
chilly chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#itsdrinkstime
no jaggerbomb! the only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'no' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to

of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

"i and my friend went here to watch the ipl live screening and have some good time. one good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through zomato gold. the food pretty decent too, but what i didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. we eventually went for masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. we asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. wasn't happy with the service.

also the live music there wasn't great.",3,Neutral

"all services delayed, menu changes, very limited options in snack and food when asked they say it‚Äôs menu from delhi and can‚Äôt help. inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table. asked for french fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in. ok last one came finally when the manager arrived after being aggressive. they want to offer free drinks but it‚Äôs not about money but experience, will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back.",1,Very Negative
"this was my second visit to the place and i am very disappointed for the following reasons:

1) the first time i visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue

i dicided to give it another shot and came again.

2) ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. it's as hard a a rock. cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3) ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4) dj was pathetic. it was supposed to be ""bollywood hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.

ps: if you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good dj. you need feel the pulse of audience.",2,Negative

the only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.

until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.

later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.

will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.

"review :

recently we've received an invitation from hyper local. it's on the 3rd or top floor of sln terminus, gachibowli, just next to platinum cinemas. the place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. and if you go there before sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. the ambiance is pretty good, with:

full bar

nightlife

live music

private dining area available

wi-fi

live sports screening

indoor seating

smoking area

buffet

if you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. i find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

they are serving ipl live screening with bucket bonanza where you can get 4 pints of beer including a veg/non-veg starter. but you need to remember the entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

anyway, yesterday, i went to keep the invitation. it was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. i asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. first, they served lsd, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like gin, vodka, tequila, rum & triple sec. and made with freshly squeezed orange juice. triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. and with the use of fresh orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. i was eagerly waiting for the mocktail. thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. the mocktail was served along with chicken taco.

the mocktail was made with fresh kiwi & mint. the flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

after that i tried their chicken taco. those tacos were made for indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. those tacos were stuffed with indian spiced grilled chicken and topped with mint raita and served in malabar ghee fried parotas. taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the malabar parota. as the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, i suggested to use plain wheat four/maida tortillas, i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken. and yes, the tacos were too filling, i could have only 2 of them.

now it's time for the cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. and believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice orange flavored & very refreshing. i could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

the stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. i left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish chicken sambousek, what is that? that is baharat spiced chicken keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. served with 3 types of dip, mayo, mint raita & sweet tamarind & saffron chutney. i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

now you might be wondering what baharat spice is? as per the chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. in this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. so, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa, but the taste was very different. and that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

i felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

service was a professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

as per my experience, young people have a great option for a bar cum restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",5,Positive
they have worst north indian food i believe. spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food. but other than that chinese and continental was good. their safe sex on beach deink is great just.,3,Neutral
"monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have got being screened then things get better. yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of got. i had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. they are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇ

i ordered for üçÖüç∏ blood diamond bloody mary to start with which was different when they added dijon mustard. you can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. the bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. my next cocktail was thyme of your life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. the üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. i would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time i finally ordered the indianised version of pasta- fusili in kasuri methi and coriander sauce. the name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. it was full of medium size diced veggies like- zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.

it was good experience on my first visit. the staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. overall i would like to rate it 4/5. you should definitely try this place for hangouts.",4,Positive

i visited the place last week. the food was tasty and so was ambience but i have serious concern with the services.

we asked for regular water , and they brought dirty, stinky water just to sell the bottled water. the waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free.

it was highly irresponsible.
also we had to literally beg them to bring the cheque.

"oh my god, what a horrible place. they have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. and in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. they serve cocktails, but i would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. cocktails including lit (a glass of ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this i've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.

all this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!

again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when i implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!

during all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, i guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.

be aware people. avoid this place.",1,Very Negative
"the drunch trend has picked up in hyderabad and hyperlocal has joined in too.
the ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. the utilisation of the limited space is done well. a good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.
moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched drudge menu. priced at rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. however if you are early i.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799.
they had a theme which revolved around delhi street food.
the drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. we tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.

the buffet consisted of golgappe, dahi bhalle, sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, dahi kachori, chole bhature, red thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.

golgappe, sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. dahi kachori was a complete let down.
the bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.
chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.
the red thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a chinese preparation.
noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
the chicken tikka pockets were dry.
the chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.
overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. the idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.
the music was extremely loud for the place.
overall we had a below average experience.

based on the drunch menu i would rate it 2.5/5",3,Neutral

i had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place. we were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation (it separates balcony from the bar). we told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing. you don't have to worry about anything. till that time we had ordered our food. but seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out.,1,Very Negative

chholey calzone: a treat to the taste buds. kulcha pockets filled with chholey.

"visited hyper local for their newly launched drunch buffet. the buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. the place itself is located in a good, open area inside sln terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

my experience with their food was decent. the drunch layout comprised of north indian inspired starters such as dahi bhalle, dahi vade, gol gappe as well as papdi chaat. i would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. my favorite of the lot was their golgappe.

speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of chole bhature, veg hakka noodles, red thai curry, chicken pizza, steamed rice, chicken tikka, chicken wings and chicken pockets. looking at the price of the drunch, i feel a bit more items should have been on offer. their chicken pizza and chicken tikka were simply delicious. however, they need to work upon their thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

the best part about the place was the drinks section. loved the preparation of wet garden cocktail, sangria and cranberry cooler. special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. one can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

all in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. happy eating. :)",3,Neutral
"hyper local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
the place is widely spread evenly with three sections. two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
the first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. the two sections are contrasting with each other. the bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
hyper local has introduced the trending ""drunch"", a sundowner party on sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
it includes unlimited food and drinks in rs 1200/_.
the food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
the drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
coming to food.... the menu is inspired from the delhi region thus has the typical delhi street style starters like gol gappe, papdi chaat, matar kulche,
chole bhature, and dahi vade.
the main course has a subtle style including thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
drinks were amazing here. my personal favourite was pina colada, fall alert and sangria wine from the menu.

i tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 2+2 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well. the waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don‚Äôt speak hindi. of course we left immediately and don‚Äôt think that will ever come back.,1,Very Negative
i went there two times both for lunch.. first time food was very tasty and service was great but second time there was a little rush which detoriated the quality of food and service both a little bit. but overall nice place and a must visit,4,Positive
"situated at the top floor of sln terminus along with food court area.
ambience and decor is pleasing.
buffet doesn't do justice to price paid in terms of variety and service. we had to wait for bowls, spoons and refill of chutney etc.
they serve one veg soup, 2 veg starter, live pasta which was also not upto the mark, 3 curry, rice,biryani and different bread option. gulabjamun and ice cream in dessert.",3,Neutral

"i am wondering if i had ordered thick shake or an ice cream.. thick shake will have better consistency than this.. most of my previous orders were in the same condition, yet i gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand .. not any more. spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. if you guys couldn't provide ice cream in proper way then please stop giving home delivery.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. i wonder if i can actually call this as an ice cream. some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... not satisfied with your ice cream. . not worth spending a single rupee on this one.

i was trying to take a pic and then this happened. i didn't keep pressure while holding. you can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. i didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. both quantity n quality was not good. i understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. i place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes. despite of the distance and presence of dry ice, the ice cream melted completely.",1,Very Negative

i tried the red velvet and willy wonka icecreams. they are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
willy wonka is made from chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. one ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.

must try if you have a sweet tooth!!!",5,Positive

been there for couple of times hoping that they will improve in terms of quality and service but honestly if you really want to eat some dumplings mix with 2or 3 pices of potatoes or paneer or whatever then go there and i bet you you will curse yourself later the funniest thing is that they don‚Äôt even know how to make a proper paratha or kulcha they are just making fool to everyone on the name of ‚Äúnorth indian food‚Äù instead search for another joints in madhapur or gachibowli like ‚Äúparathas and more‚Äù or ‚Äújust paratha‚Äù there you will get the real authentic food.,1,Very Negative
dropped down my expectations. ordered aloo tikki which was worst and palak chat which ended up delivering dhahi chat. that tasted sweet. i regret ordering.,1,Very Negative
i ordered dahi bhalla papdi chaat and this is how they packed. they should pack it in a plastic box. the dahi was spilled over the polythene and hardly 20% of the dahi was left in the container. i paid money for nothing. they should give my money back for it.,4,Positive

"sardaarji's chaats & more serves really good punjabi food. if you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food, this place is a really good option in and around gachibowli. as the name suggests, they have amazing chaats.

i have tried parathas from a lot of places in gachibowli. and found the perfect places for parathas! but this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. the only problem is the packaging. it's not horrible. you can work with it. but comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.

aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. it was delivered hot and fresh! papadi with dahi was delicious! the curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. the papadis were very crispy and crunchy. it was topped with green chutney.
the quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. so, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.
i'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!

since, i never visited this place, can't talk much about the hygiene of this place! but overall, the experience was good.",4,Positive
"in plain simple words overhyped. very greasy and oily and bland taste. order chole bhatire, mix veg kulcha, daal makhani and aloo tikki. everything was very poor in taste. better to put some effort and visit bikanerwala in jubilee hills.",1,Very Negative

nice place to go in the evenings and have something tasty like kachori, pav baji , dahipuri , vada pav etc etc ... i would highly recommend everyone to taste food here üëç",4,Positive
"it was too good. we ordered bhelpuri, dahi papri and aloo tikki with chutney. i must admit three of them were equally good. the dahi papri was sweet n tangy,, bhelpuri was well balanced with spices and lot of shev and finally aloo tikki with dhaniya chutyney was tangy and spicy in a balanced way .with well balanced spices and awesome taste this place stole my heart.

chole bhature was yummy. paneer butter masala was not that great in comparison of chole bhature.",4,Positive
"this restaurant is famous for quick bites and street food. it is located in indra nagar, gachibowli which is the most accessible place for techies in hyderabad. this place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintained.

we get all kinds of street food like chaat, pav bhaji, paratha, chole bhature, rajma chawal etc. we had chole bhature and this was the best that i had in the recent times. if you want, you can get extra chole curry. and the butter milk and lassi here has the punjabi essence in it. you will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with butter milk/lassi.

if you're in search of proper north indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. the cost in this restaurant is very affordable. for the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable.",4,Positive

chole bhatoore (5/5)

chole bhatoore were amazing. do eat those bhatoore at the outlet itself.",5,Positive
"sardarji's gives you a feel of north indian chat and chole bhatoore outlets. they have that similar arrangement outside where everyone have to stand and enjoy their chat,pav bhaji,chole bhatoore on high tables.

i recently visited sardarji's and tried lot of items of it

gol gappe (3.5/5)
gol gappes were good but the paani can be made more tangy.they only have one varieties of paani,and of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in it.

aloo tikki (4/5)
aloo tikki was very good. red and green chutneys were perfect.

samosa (4/5)

chole bhatoore (5/5)
chole bhatoore were amazing.do eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at home.choles are also very tasty.

looking forward to try more of their items.their naan size was huge and other items looked very tempting.

"sardarji's chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over (for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi).

the sandwiches, especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome. the dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. 
however, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.

another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes. i would never recommend anyone ordering paratha's from this place and i tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked. this is the reason i have rated them as 3 out 5.",3,Neutral
better to take away or ask for delivery. cost is fine but the taste is the specialty. north indians can find their taste and dishes being rediscovered here.,5,Positive

yesterday there was leakage of water pipe(possibly drainage pipe)at restaurant .... instead of repairing that they are shamelessly kept counter open .... customer had to stand in line while water is leaking beside and at the same time eat beside that water leaking pipeline .... i would suggest first repair pipe line and then open restaurant....... serving in this condition to customers shows no value of customers,1,Very Negative

i order a veg biryani. it was cold when it reached me. the taste was just bland and they had 1/4th of the biryani filled with half cooked beans. even the cauliflower was not cooked properly. they should just remove the biryani from their menu forever.,1,Very Negative

#reviewmode

bbbq nation has come up with all new dawat -e - ramadan where they've bought in few of the best street foods of ramadan which really makes one visit and satisfying their foodie soul's!

i was pretty excited to try out their ramadan special menu and the moment i enter i see a big raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot mutton chops searing on ghee! that view enticed me and i just walked toward it to see that beauty happening. i couldn't wait to try that super appetising chops and delicious raan!

besides they also got chicken shawarma and mutton haleem which is another different delicacy storyline...
i had to take a big bowl of haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and final touch with two spoons of ghee. yes that's my style! üòâ

i walked to see few more exciting dishes and i found the legendary badami gosht! yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides murgh mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma, that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers...

cannot miss thier gosht biryani üòã one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well. perfectly tender meat and soft and fragrant basmati with a touch of ghee!

only because of the taste and being foodie i had two rounds of everything and was full...
but there's always a another stomach for kulfi!
pan-pista-malai, voila!",5,Positive

"have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013. have been to the restaurant in different cities, and have noticed some significant differences across all locations.
this gachibowli bbq nation has some items missing from its live counter, but have curd rice which wasn‚Äôt available in any other location i have been to.
the staff is extremely courteous. we were served by rajib, who was really warm, quick in his service.
the overall quality of the food was satisfying, just like most of the other outlets i‚Äôve been to.",4,Positive
"as usual it's fab place to have grill in a buffet. non veg is awesome here. chicken, mutton, prawns, fish are served on the grill. some days you also get crab curry. now they opened tawa starters as well.

nice place to go for team lunch/dinner.",5,Positive
"food quality is good. but not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of bn or abs. so, it was really disappointing.

also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. that really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. i think the number of waiters are less.

ac facility was good, very cold.

but i don‚Äôt recommend this place.",2,Negative
"this is an amazing place for veg as well as non veg starters. there are so many varieties in it. as you will be already full, you don't generally go for main course and also it's very average. i really love their service. suppose you don't like item, they will replace it by customising according to your requirement.",5,Positive

"i am a big fan of bbq nation since a decade now. this however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

the only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. i booked a table for 14 from zomato. it was ready for us when we arrived.

everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

the starters took forever to be served. most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. the mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

the chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. when we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. his version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

i would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.",3,Neutral

"we went to this place as a part of corporate outing. it was my first time to barbeque nation. i must admit that i was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. the starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. when it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, i would say. the waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies.",4,Positive
"barbeque is mostly my favorite but if i compare barbeque nation with abs , sahib's barbeque... obviously i have to give one point less to this one...food is good but limited items..but if you have kid go there my son and my friend's kids enjoyed a lot there they were given car and balloon by staff and lots of fruits and french fries...they enjoyed to the core... ambience is gud service excellent...

"friday afternoon, we planned team lunch (veg & non-veg) in gachibowli barbecue nation. we were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food & variety served was average and wasn't upto standard w.r.t taste & variety.

in short, it wasn't value for money. 

i think it would be better to choose absolute barbecue over barbecue nation, as customer you get value for money. seems like now barbecue nation is just riding on its legacy.",3,Neutral

this place is good when you come empty stomach... just kidding . barbeque nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts. has a lag in my order when i had been there last time but i guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine. a very good place with very welcoming staff.,4,Positive
went yesterday to bbq. wonderful service. special thanks to roy who took care of us.he kept checking if everything was fine or need to customize anything. food was yummy. became a big fan of bbq. good going guys!!!!,5,Positive

from the greeting to serving and the host was so nice...i must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service.
the starters were amazing....i love prawns but it's kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned 
but their prawns are the best grilled prawns i ever tasted. they could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course.... my personal favs were grilled prawns and rosemary chicken...mmm..  mmm... mmmmm yummy !!!! 

thank you so much for your excellent service and great food..hope to visit you guys soon..!!!",4,Positive

i would specially like to mention about mr naresh from bbq nation gachiwoli. the way he treats and welcomes you will make you visit this place all over again and again.. he takes care of you from giving you the best seats available to the best of the food you can have. i give him and this place 5 bright stars..",5,Positive

ambiance : good enough
service : the staff were all very polite but a bit slow

the taste of food was very good. they had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, american corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. on the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. the main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. the dessert options were sorted and tasty. they had 2 ice cream flavours, gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi. over all the experience was very good.

would want to visit againüòä",4,Positive
it used to be one of my favourite places and the destination for all family celebrations. however over the time i feel it has lost that touch. there is no more aawww feeling when u eat at this place. they don‚Äôt compromise on the quality of food but i was disappointed with the taste. we tried at both forum mall and gachibowli branches and it felt the same.,3,Neutral
been here with friends on a weekday for dinner and this place never fails to meet expectations...be it any outlet. the food is great...the staff was friendly. only one negative with this outlet is space...it is extremely congested...the tables are too closely placed...hardly any proper aisle space for guests to walk!,4,Positive

"we were here to give our treat to a group of friends. what started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. the grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. as soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. the waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. i am not exaggerating when i say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. i did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. they almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. finally i was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till i did that. feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. the food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.",1,Very Negative
"the best restaurant we have been to, till date.
awesome food and great service. the hospitality shown at the restaurant each and every time that we have visited is at the peaks compared to other restaurants. we treat this restaurant as a family restaurant and make sure we visit this once a month. never disappointed us in any aspect..
not even once..",5,Positive

"have visited this place on 2nd october with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. all the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.

coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. it was really amazing in taste. potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. there was no dish which didnt disappoint.

main course - this is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. all the dishes were really good in taste, usually i skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here i have tried and it was really good. egg curry, chicken, mutton rogan all were good. biryani was also good. noodles with sauce were delicious enough. it wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.

dessert - my favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.

overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. they didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. service was top notch as usual and value for money. this outlet is one the best on in hyderabad hands down.",5,Positive
"we are very satisfied with the food and the service was excellent. ""we want our customers to be fully satisfied"" said the chef and he meant it.",4.5,Positive
"we went to this place on wednesday for dinner. it was difficult to find a table and had to wait for 30 minutes. the ambience of the place is average and its a small place however the starters were really good (crispy corn, panner tikka, mushroom and fruit bbq). coming to the main course, it was average but the desserts were really good especially gulab jamun, rabadi and kulfi.",4,Positive
"really these barbeque nation's outlet is so friendly....i never seen before....we went there last night, total number were 40+...lots of kids were in my gang....they are playing a lot....they are means staffs of barbeque nation, always looking smile....now, foods are just too good...kuch kehene ki baat i nehi hain",5,Positive
"to start with , the complimentary drinks blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. the nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. the veg starters - mushroom is a immediate no , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. coming to desserts : its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section. i can only rate it 3 for food , 5 for service , 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter.",3,Neutral
"we had a fantastic time and loved the service and food both. the serving personnel made extra sure of comfort for the kids, kudos to azaad and team.",5,Positive
"i almost forgot to write the review as i got too busy until i found these pictures in my gallery. i was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. what a bad day it was. when you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. first of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. i was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. i politely asked to replace the drink that was served. but things got too much for me when i found a hair in the crispy corn. when i put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all i got to listen was they will replace it. that‚Äôs what drove me mad. when i demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. but i was done with the food now. no more nonsense. at the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. the team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. the overall experience was bad, something not expected from a bbq nation.",2,Negative
"this place goes and keeps up with the name! amazing starters. the chicken kebabs are wonderful. the crispy corn and the cajun spice potatoes are super duper awesome!! after the rounds of starters,. there wasn't any space for the main course so directly went for desserts. their in house kulfis are the speciality here. paan kulfi tastes the best! gulab jamuns with ice-cream make the perfect combo.",4,Positive

keep it up and thumbs up for barbeque nation , gachibowli.
my birthday went awesome",5,Positive

ice tea served was more proportion of water . ice tea flavour was not there at all. partha served over the counter was pathetic. it was having very bad quality of oil not even ghee. very much upset with the food quality this time.",2,Negative
"awesome place !!!

1. good ambiance,
2. great food ( veg)

"this was my first time at a ""barbeque nation."" i've heard great things about it, people sounded like they serve food from heaven.
now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. the service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. they were serving complimentary drinks, i selected ice tea, worst one i've ever had.
the good thing about this place, their ""manager,"" he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.
i liked the ambience of this place, will definitely give another chance to this outlet ‚úåÔ∏è",3,Neutral

"unlimited bbq food with delicious desserts-
ambiance-
barbeque nation is located near wipro lake exactly beside deli 9 bistro. this outlet of barbeque nation is quite congested. as it is situated at the ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. they play silent english songs in the background.
food-
as we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. they served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. as we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. in the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. we had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. after that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. we requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. in main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, chinese and biryani. finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, gulab jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.
service-
service was very quick and the staff was very good. chef himself came to our table to take the feedback.",4,Positive
the service is too good.. if you are not satisfied with any food item basudev will recook as per your wish and serves it again... the service is just excellent compared to other outlets..,5,Positive
food was tasty. staffs were very friendly. although the options in main course as well as for starters was a bit less and service was relatively slow when compared to other barbeques. still would recommend to visit once.,4,Positive
"visited it along with my friends for lunch today..
most of the staters were served was of same taste n less grilled.fish n chicken n prawn everything tastes same.after repetative reminder also they served the same.also there is not much varieties are available for stater.main course is ok.deserts are pathetic.they are serving it for namesake..it's a horrible experience overall",1,Very Negative
"i visited today . to be honest it's waste of money .... everything that they serve tastes the same ... there is no variety of tastes... fish and chicken almost tastes similar... it's like they have put the same spices on fish .. chicken , mushroom and prawns.. deserts are simply the worst.... it's like just name sake they are serving ...
for those who want to taste something good.. it's not recommended.",1,Very Negative
"i went there with my parents, and it was totally worth it. the service was extremely good and my parents loved every bit of it.
starters and dessert always amazing.
main course have a lot of varities but we always fill ourselves with starters that no place is left in stomach to try main course.
overall it has been one of my favourite place .",5,Positive

"excellent service and food buffet! this place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. the pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.

then best starters are cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. all the starters are lip-smacking. make sure to keep room for the main course.

i haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.

coming to desserts, gal jamuns are literally out of the world. try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. you wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. üòçüò¨ there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.

always up for a barbque grill üçñ",5,Positive
"visited it along with my friend for dinner buffet last week. 

most of the starters were served slowly. even after repetitive reminding no response from the staff. fish starters were not well cooked. chicken starters & crispy corn were good.

mains and desserts were good as usual, not much different from others.",3,Neutral
"more expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place, you will realise why it's worth every penny. from the starters to the main course. everything was rich in flavour and taste. softest mutton sheekh kebab ever i tasted here. the menu didn't include mutton keema, yet our waiter gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan. his hospitality is worth mentioning. the head chef came and took our feedback. very warm ambience, good people and great food. don't miss this place.",5,Positive

"it‚Äôs a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation. i should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish, chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention. the main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package. it‚Äôs a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals, birthday celebrations or friends hangout.",4,Positive
we went here from office. a group of 17 members. we were the first so seating was not an issue. i had veg starters and it was marvellous. for once the spice levels matched my lower than normal hyderabad spice margins. the paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire. the corn fried were very good. food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup. desserts we very good. on the whole a satisfying experience.,4,Positive
"always good , for non veg starters are too good than veg , still overall it's good , always biryani will be same kasmiri flavoured , hope next time i may get new flavoured biryani , rest all staff and service were good",4,Positive
barbeques are one of my favorites. barbeque nation is a perfect blend of good food and ambience. always been best at servicing. would be better if they try something new for birthday wishes.,4,Positive
"quick review points
- slippery floor .. be careful when you good with high heels or children. perhaps they don't have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place
- bathrooms meant for rotten rats... dirty washroom and tiny doors. hefties and jumbo sizes, you can't get in
- service ... ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. for sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.
- advance bookings ... they don't understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in
- pan kulfi... it should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color. pathetic and not worth giving tough time to your taste buds.",2.5,Negative

i liked the way staff took my concern regarding pastry where i felt contained an egg (i am vegetarian). they not only ensured me that the said pastry is egg less but also offered me special chocolate chips icecream. you guys are just too good in the hospitality. will love keep coming back there.",5,Positive
"numerous options. grilled chicken and prawn , all the kulfis in different flavors are tasty. pineapple jalebi was very different but okz in taste.a perfect place to satisfy ur hunger with great food , ambiance and service.

"i have visited barbeque nation multiple times and it has been beyond my expectations every time. i love the items which they keep on their grills especially the non-vegetarian ones. in the non-veg ones i most like their prawns and the fish. i had forgot to mention the service and the ambience. the service is good and even the ambience is great. in of the grill i like the crispy corn and  the and some aloo thing they serve it is always awesome. as we went there on jewel of the sea festival, i had got crab curry (with no flesh in it) and we had butter naan and tandoori roti. crab curry was not so great but nice. the butter naan was great and even the tandoori roti was nice. we even went for curd rice and dal makhni. both of them were nice. my overall experience with barbeque nation was awesome.",4,Positive
"service was pathetic. ordered a sizzler with lamb, was told no lamb. ordered another sizzle with noodles. it took 15 mins to serve that one. also, served it with rice instead and when i asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. i sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

no apologies, nothing from there side. when asked for manager, told me he is not here.

prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup.",2,Negative

"visited for lunch today with colleagues and ordered one spicy chicken sizzler combo and two buffets. the buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler , though without the sides (fries, veggies and noodles/rice). the buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce. would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet.",4,Positive

"i went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. loved the sizzlers.. so i recommended it for a team lunch. they preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. the most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
no body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. we can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. we had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
finally they served and none of us liked the food. all they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
even if the food was not good, i would not give such rating. but the service is very disappointing.
if if there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. but being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
don‚Äôt think i would go back there again.",1,Very Negative

"i have order veg sizzler but and they served me the non veg sizzler. i had it without knowing it. the server was rude, unpolite and refused to accept his mistakes and even manager to the same extent. there is no proper communication between chef and server. it was worst experience in my life as i am a pure vegeterian. i would recommend not to visit this place. i would choose negative rating as a best option.",1,Very Negative

service also good

amazing food, tasty finger food i recommend cheese stuffed mushroom & fish n chips and many more to try.
when coming to sizzlers, fish shashlik sizzler is the best.
must try caramel custard and sizzling brownie dessert.

* highly recommended best sizzlers restaurant
we will visit again",5,Positive
"we had a very bad experience here. we have ordered fish shashilk and sizzling chicken sizzlers. the fish shashilk sizzler didn't have fish in it. upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that i had already not eaten it. he then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. i had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. it's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.

i would have given one star. but one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.",2,Negative
prakash served us food . he is very generous and did tell us the speciality .. must try grilled chicken sizzler and sizzling brownie.. they are just awesome.,5,Positive

worst food and service.. after long waiting we got the food.. we ordered starters and sizzler.. they prepared the food and forgot i think.. this is the first i have seen a place with starters in cold stage... been to this place for more than 10 times and never had complaints on food. but today is nightmare.. worst food and their best item is chicken shashlik sizzler which is worst today.. bye bye absolute..,1,Very Negative
"this place is good for a casual lunch and dinner with friends or family. this place offers a wide variety of sizzlers and other starters and main course as well . during my last 2 visits i‚Äôve tried a non veg platter, 2-3 different types of non-veg sizzlers, tikka pizza with add-ons like fries üçü n all.

while the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.
service isn‚Äôt up to the mark , once your order is taken it‚Äôs lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how‚Äôs the food??!!. well not just that ask for a chutney or mayonnaise or a water bottle you ain‚Äôt getting it until you call up to them couple of times.",4,Positive

. worth if you have zomato gold too. shankar who served us very polite. will be visiting once again soon.",5,Positive
not worth visiting. waited for a very long time about half an hour. people who know what a sizzler is will not like it for sure. i think restaurant name should be changed as they have buffet and other indian food in the menu.,2,Negative

"i had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce. i wouldn't say it was the worst, but it was not up there. there was no smokiness like the name claimed, just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn't really need to be there in it, in the first place. i would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded. the spaghetti was also slightly overcooked.",3,Neutral

worth the money and
had a good service from shravan kumar",5,Positive
"a friday outing in absolute sizzlers. quite pocket friendly option (even more if you have zomato gold).
had ordered mushroom sizzler and chicken sizzler. the portion is enough for 1 person. we had ordered french fries as side dish.

this place is amazing for weekend fun hangouts and let your tireness go away. the dj is awesome and plays best bollywood songs and punjabi too. the veg pizza and pastas are pretty good to try along with fruit punch. but if you want to have a good fun filled and energetic time go here. this place the best music to groove to and has pretty ambience to get clicked.,4,Positive
"this is what we were served today when we ordered for grilled paneer. i think this was someone's left over which we were served. giving the benefit of doubt that they might have made some mistake, i informed them that it might be a mistake but the manager said that they didn't have enough plated to serve and hence they served it like this. after a lot of arguments they finally decided to change it. but the story does not end here. they served us ice cold paneer in a different plate. i will just finish my beer and leave now.",1,Very Negative
"i am absolutely in love with this place, not much hyped but still crowded. i recommend to visit on weekdays and weekends can get overcrowded. pizza was good, so were the other titbits but what i liked most was there service, took time to place the order at the pos but the bartender whipped up my drink in no second bad i never had to call out for a repeat, it was ready each time. overall i go to this place every other week one of the best party place around.",5,Positive

the taste was not great while quantity is okay.",4,Positive

friday night visited there with my girl gang. i had booked the table in order to avoid any hastle. was seated in a quiet corner on the deck side of the space. i loved the food they served‚Äî each and every item. the dj for that night was very good and we danced till the last song! only the service a bit dissatisfying because the bill was generated incorrectly and over the amount what we had consumed. expect better care to be taken !,4,Positive
"it was a night out with gal pals.

when we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.

warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the tv.

they have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. that is what server told us.

the server came and took our orders.

we ordered starters and drinks.

as soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.

it kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.

then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. the server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.

other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. instead he said he cant take it back.

anyways moving on

the cocktail which i had were really good. the cosmopolitan, beer trap and screw driver.

the starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. i can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. italian cheese fingers - they were crispy and yum, stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the nachos were okay , have had better ones . the crispy corn was good . last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.

the music was good , being a bollywood night we requested dj to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. we four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. he didnt oblige at all.

would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? god knows.

food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.

hope they improve their hospitality. that is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.

if you are traveling to hyd. and don't want to go any random place for pubbing. you surely can rely on this place.",4,Positive
"to enter this bar, you have to go from the main entrance of the mall. there is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. you may find it little bit awkward.

coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. you better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. we booked in advance but still we didn‚Äôt get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).

we ordered singapore noodles, mixed fried rice, chicken wet and white sauce pasta.

singapore noodles - 5/5
mixed fried rice - 5/5
chicken wet - 4/5
white sauce pasta - 2/5
they didn‚Äôt have pizza on the day we went.

music- they played good english songs early and followed by hindi songs. songs were very good.

drinks - you have to order through their app. so we had to install and order. it was not very convenient. the price of drinks on the menu in zomato has no relation with the actual price. cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.

barexchange.

its a great place to hangout and party with ur friends, has a groovy music and a big dance floor, it also has an option of open air and this place is crowded on weekends.
it's all based on the demand and supply that day!
a large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is, and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day, in real time. all you need to do is download their app, which also shows you the trading board, and use it to place your order.
the food is acceptably good and service is quick.",4,Positive

"i have ordered food couple of times from this place but never been there. mostly i used to order thali for lunch. which was worthy. this was my first physical visit to the restaurant. and i was very amazed to see all the glory around me. ambience, look, coziness and lighting all were so perfect. the soft couches were so comfortable. then moving to the food, i ordered chicken steak platter. this contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. the quantity was enough to fill the belly. further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. it was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. in drinks i had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. i found this place very nice to hang out with friends. it is not family friendly. staff is courteous. there are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience. trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place.

"interesting cocktail menu, which a wide range of starters to try. there is a constant live screen showcasing the trading prices to drinks available .",3,Neutral
"filtered entry - check
welcome assistance - check
crowd - check
ambience - check

what's great? nothing.

it's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.

the fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and i don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.

overall, i liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night. we left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night.

the cocktails are good though.",3,Neutral
a great party place and a decent size dance floor to try out all your new moves and get loose. the food is tasty and love the concept of ordering drinks via app as per drink exchange rate.,4,Positive
"grate place for food lovers, the tempting and mouth watering dishes are speechless, loved the ambiance and the vibe of the place, surely recommended for its food and ambiance.",4,Positive
"we are here on thursday night and place was empty at the time we reached but they says every table is reserved , so we found a place finally and ordered maggi pizza which took them 40 minutes to serve by that time we loose our appetite !! even customer service is late ! food was good but they did not accept dine out pay !",2,Negative
"good ambience, good food, good dance place.

three of us girls went to this place on a rainy friday evening and it turned out to be good fun. we ordered:

white sauce pasta: it was awesomely tasty. the sauce was made correctly with the right consistency. there were vegetables in it.

nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.

chicken kebabs: just wow. the best dish of the evening for us. soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.

we also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).

it also has a good dance place. furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.

all in all, an awesome experience and i would have given 5 stars, but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star.",4,Positive
"ambiance, staff, environment was all set to peaks. music was much much appreciated. i was been there on ladies night but that doesn‚Äôt stopped stags to get in and the crowd was amazing. best bar stock exchange witnessed up to now. we had a very good day watching ipl match.",5,Positive
"amazing place!
the ambience is good and the music is even great!
i‚Äôve been here thrice in the past three weeks and it turned out to be pretty amazing experience always.

their exchange system of liquor pricing is quite good and affordable to most.
i‚Äôve even had jameson for 140 bucks a peg! üòÖüòÖ
their lit is effective üòõ

i‚Äôve tried their chicken tikka biryani and hot asian noodles!
chicken tikka biryani was amazing! i loved it! üòç

will i visit this place again?: yes! yes! yes!

btw: they have liquor at mrp on every mondays!",4,Positive
the music was over the top and it has a decent dance floor. food was good and this place accepts zomato gold 1+1 offer. as it‚Äôs a bar exchange you will get to enjoy drinks at lower cost as well üòâ,5,Positive
i can't tell you how awesome the food has been. i ordered chinese choupsey and hot asian noodles with a roasted veg shack. damn. i was shook at the quantity because it was a lot for 2 people. absolutely loveddddddd how it tasted! i cannot begin to explain the amazing taste of the saut√©ed and partially barbecued flavor of the vegetables. i'm a pure vegetarian and lal exchange is now my fav place to eat now. üíú,5,Positive
"got a chance to visit this place with team. such a superb place to hangout. i recommend this place for parties,to watch cricket on big screen & have fun and best place to spend time with friends. the starters were too good, drinks are okay and biryani can be better...i know many people don't visit this place for biryani üòÖ

"the ambience is very nice, the place has both indoor and outdoor setting. the staff is polite.
the food however didn't excite me much, the music was average and the rate fluctuations for drinks (the main concept of the place) seemed more static and less interesting.
the cocktails didn't taste that well either. we ordered a chicken noodles didn't taste as per the grandeur of the place. the biryani was good. we also ordered lits which were not up to the mark at all.",3,Neutral
a good place to hangout. they have indoor as well as outdoor seating. live matches on big screens are quite engaging. starters are appreciable specially tandoori malai brocolli.,4,Positive
bad customer service! first we booked table near screen still they didn't give and they make people stand near screen! how the hell should we watch the match? people go to see match and they do this!,2,Negative
"although we booked our table, the suitable table couldnt be found for us. one guy passed to another one and we sat outside. after this they send inside. finally the table was found for us.
we ordered j√§germeister and baileys but we had nuts for the prices 375 and 450 (see the portion).
ok i understand that prices are fluctuates, but we didn't know that we paid for this little shots. these drinks serves with proper glass with ices, bigger portions, this is charging.
will never visit this place again!",1,Very Negative

"have been to this place...

ambience - took up the seat in the outdoor area... loved the place and the music beats....

service - staff person was santosh. he was very efficient and courteous.

food - ordered white sauce pasta, misal pav, bombay sandwich and drinks.

misal pav is great but a suggestion here. increase the quantity of misal in the plate. the taste was real good.

pasta was amazing. loved the crunchiness of veggies.

bombay sandwich - initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be.. osum... green chutney turned its magic on..

definitely must visit place..",5,Positive
"i visited this place on last saturday and i really enjoyed the evening. the best thing which i liked about the place was only groups and couples were allowed to enter the dancing floor which does not happen in delhi . i really liked the food and the crowd, would love to visit again .",5,Positive
"the place will never get bored as it has peachy music and the taste of the food was soo yummy.we tried the chicken wings they were fab!!the adornment is very classy in a lofty way.overrall a very good place to hangout with friends.

"this place is something you can never get bored off, groovy music, good food and crowd is also nice üòã . the lal street has a big dancing floor , ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also. it's very crowded on weekends like anything

talking about the food this place is zomato gold food partner. if you have it , you can enjoy the benefits
- chicken lolipop, crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce
- masala papad , stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion
- cheesy pineapple sticks (never ever order this, it was pathetic) :(
- paneer lazeez , creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese (highly recommended)
- chicken tikka masala (highly recommended)
- cheese garlic naan and butter naan

overall my evening at lal was just amazing, the service was really good. you can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure. #mydj17",4,Positive
"this was our second stop in same complex on saturday (30/03) evening. only reason i am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by gm of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.

went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met gm of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
at 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... hence the futility of all the hoopla.",2,Negative
amazing place on weekends!! must visit if you have crazy set of friends to dance with. i have been there several times and trust me it never disappoints me,5,Positive
"went to this place it is a nice place but customer service is not good, they accepted my table booking but later when i visit the place they did not allot me table u just have to hit the bar counter.

note to manager- if u can't provide table just don't accept it.",1,Very Negative

but food, in taste and quality, was not up to the mark.
also the service was poor. waiters were not waiting properly, you had to call everytime for small things like glasses or plates.",2,Negative

good place to hangout. its bit boring to order from apo though. üòê food is okay okay.. we had many different chicken n veg starters. dj kept atmosphere lively.,3,Neutral
"the drinks were good, the food was mediocre, the service was pathetic.
the waiter asked us when are we leave, apparently they overbooked, and even the service was slow.",3,Neutral
"first of all special mention to santosh who really made our evening very best by his great service. he was superb in taking our orders and serving really fast. thank you santosh for it.

now coming to f&b, though little priced on high end, it was worth it. every thing we ordered in veg, non veg and drinks (mocktails) we're really good... music was lovely, ambience was perfect and above all i believe wednesday is ladies night... so all the girls / ladies you know one place to go as well, if you didn't know so far like me... :-)

overall... very well spent time and gathered loads of memories as always... will go again for sure... just waiting for a reason, if not will make one ... :-)",5,Positive
"even though this place is huge, we couldn't find a place to sit initially. around 10.30 we finally got a place to sit. the food and the bar here is good and service was prompt (once you get a table). the dj played some nice bollywood songs. overall it's a nice place but i'd recommend to book a table before you go here if you are planning to visit on weekends.",4,Positive
"the dj who plays at this place is really good. we went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot. on the downside, the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place.

the people on bar counter suck big time as they don't talk properly, give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available.",3,Neutral
"the lal street is been good for the first time. today i went and booked a table, where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar. then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us, where there was no-one to entertain us and take our order. we sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. then suddenly being saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. everyone want their saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. no doubt music played by dj was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.
food was fine though but ambience is good.",3,Neutral
good place to hangout when you buddies and pals. dj just turns on the dance floor. place gets over crowded in weekends but the ambience makes you to stay and enjoy your drink.,5,Positive
"what an ambience. it was a saturday evening on which we visited this place.
it has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages. we could order ourselves from the app.

the lal street (to be read as dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed). 

in terms of food, we ordered two preparations,
cheese chilly toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.
the lal special pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from kolkata)

if you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. we ordered black dog triple gold reserve for around 180 inr. 

it's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food.",4,Positive

"the best thing about tls is it's dj. dj played a good collection of songs, it has a separate dance floor which is a major plus point. the ambience is good, food is above average and service is prompt.
a good place for sat nights..",4,Positive
"the waiter here. specially manager srini is worst and rude person here. suggest never go to this place , they treat people as they are getting food for free.",1,Very Negative
"visited here saturday evening, place was full crowded and it took time to get a table though i've booked online. drinks prices keeps changing here as stock market exchange prices which is speciality of the bar. dance floor, ambience, music everything is so good here.",4,Positive
"the pricing here will be an interesting one to see! the higher the drinks get sold, the more the price is. ambience looks decent and the dance floor is big.
starters menu is good, we had cheese balls and chicken started. the pricing seems to be expensive on starters compared to other similar restaurants.",4,Positive
"place was a complete let down. was there for lunch on sunday and was disappointed. the veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce. 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins. staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on saturday. the only saving grace were the drinks. so unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks, skip the place.",2,Negative
"great place, awesome music and great ambiance but waiters are unfriendly. though i can recommend this place for the fun atmosphere and good music",3,Neutral
been here on a sunday afternoon. the place was quite empty as it was afternoon. the starters n drinks are quite expensive but zomato gold is applicable so it became quite reasonable as we were only 2 people. the ceaser salad here is the best i had in the city.,5,Positive

"visited with office friends. first things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. they kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ we even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. the server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

coming to the food:
vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. so, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) etc.

the main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

the sweet section would make anyone happy. a thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!",4,Positive

i have ordered from here using the zomato app. the ordering was simple. they responded very fast and i had the food delivered within 30 minutes of the order. this was a happy experience. the burgers were very good and the chicken legs still warm and succulent. the rice with small chicken nuggets was also excellent though the quantity seems to be a little less.,4,Positive

both the zomato and kfc are cheating employees. since order is placed on zomato app and delivered by kfc people none of them is willing to take responsibility even when the order is not delivered for two hours. sad part is zomato is not refunding money which means customers are paying for not having their meals,1,Very Negative

the store is quite neat and clean.. might be the reason there r only two tables..

staff is quite good nd cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. hash brown potato i did not liked it there was no taste actually.. for my palate.. coming to üçî burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..

but over all its good.. want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. this box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. no heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxes

keep going good guys.. see u again",4,Positive

are you bored taking north indian foods from south indian restaurant? then you must try the limited yet handcrafted north indian cuisines in norfest which is rapidly increasing its presence in the city. i strongly recommend to all the city dwellers to stop by through this unique chain at affordable price with premium quality service. must try- makki di roti and sarson da saag. i still feel those mellowing taste of this dish.,5,Positive
"norfest!! northern food feat!

serves well to it‚Äôs name. the large menu catering to all needs of group and individual combos.

food suggestion - dal makkhani is a must! everything on the menu is great.. a treat for both vegetarians and non - vegetarians! very soft and fresh food.

the malai kofta gravy is more on the sweeter side...",4,Positive

ordered paneer makhani from norfest and i would mark it to be the finest paneer makhani that i've ever had.. the paneer was soft and the gravy was just so amazing. the dish was made to meet utmost perfection and i recommend it as well .,5,Positive
"in simple lines ""good thing comes in small packages"" . people who love a authentic north indian / desi type , this is the place to visit.  remember this is a eat out in a shopping mall not a restaurant.

price are reasonable. they have kept there menu simple, not like in restaurant having menu books where you struggle to order.  i tried both veg and non veg [ starters and main course ] , after having a bite i had to appreciate  ""it's good"".",5,Positive
its my all time favourite.. mutton galuati kabab and paneer mirch wala are my favourite.. also one can taste shikanji/jaljeera here which is awesome..,5,Positive
amritsari kulcha and chole is must try at this restaurant. located in happening place yet economical option which provides value for money. portion size is really good and recommended to carefully order to avoid wastage,5,Positive
"well this is the first time i ordered from norfest - the dhaba. i ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice, dal makhani, 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of rs. 400. however, very disappointed with the quantity of food. at that price range they are not providing a proper portion . moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging . i gave three star only for the quality .",3,Neutral
i ordered punjabi chicken and my experience was horrible. such a costly thing of rs 300 and such less quantity that hardly one person can eat. the food too was not fresh and was stale and was smelling. had to throw it away and neither zomato nor these ppl lsitened to any queries. i wud suggest not to order from here as u can easily get at this price from good restaurants,1,Very Negative
a really good meal at a reasonable price. the quantity was perfect. not a lot and not too less. i ordered the paneer combo and shikanji . norfest dhaba has probably one of the best packaging materials. looking at the box itself i started feeling more hungry. the only part in the meal that disappointed me was the shikanji. it was not something that you could brag about.,4,Positive
greeted warmly with experienced people explaining the various dishes available. one of the best places in town if you are searching for some really tasty food. loved the taste specially the butter chicken. üòãüòã will definitely recommend my friends.,5,Positive
"this is opened up in sln terminals and visitied during lunch time, its a shop in a food court so no ambience as such.
their paneer combo is a must try, dal makhani was really good. another thing we had was amritsari kulcha with chole - kulcha was good but chole can be made better. overall a must go to place for the northside taste.",4,Positive
a must try place for north indian food lovers. the kebab items are highly recommended. the only problem is it is a part of a food court. the items are decently priced and very tasty.,4,Positive
"finally someone can make food which i could call north indian. amazing place to have a typical north indian types brunch or dinner. only con i would prefer if they did had a proper place too.

definitely visiting again.",4,Positive
"*fake rating* !!beware!!


we ordered galouti kabab and dhaba chicken... both were pathetic and nowhere close to the name of the dish.. orange galouti kabab with yellow paratha...dhaba chicken‚Äôs gravy tasted like toor daal",1,Very Negative
food was very tasty but a bit costly.specially their world famous kheer you should try. starters were amazing. you can try thali here so that you taste everything.,4,Positive
"punjabi thali is awesome. dal makhani, mix veg., and mushroom is recommended. however, cost can be reduced a bit, in particular, of the thalis.",4,Positive
"last time i ordered mutton rogan josh from here, it was amazing but today it was not fresh and only bones, no meat. it‚Äôs sad my favourite restaurant is going down in quality",3,Neutral
"the place is located in the food court of sln terminus and the first branch of norfest in the city. the seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.

as it was winter we were fortunate to have makki ki roti and sarson ka saag. the makki ki roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, saag was good but lacked salt in it. the flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.

the next thing was amritsari kulcha and chole, a must try and must have at norfest. the kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. the taste of the kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. the chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.

the final dish was the paneer lababdaar and garlic naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. so overall not recommended.

taste: 3/5",3,Neutral
"good north indian food. i ordered from them a couple of times. haven't visited the restaurant though, so can't talk abt the experience. the food is good.",4,Positive

good taste and best place with special thalis. complete punjabi taste with chaachh. one of the good punjabi taste in hyderabad. a must go at least once.,4,Positive
"i am shocked and i ever had in my life food taste like this in th any common food court of india it was my 2nd visit in 2 days, m impressed by veg galaouti kabab what a flavour , smoothness, textures, binding, combination of paratha , now i am a big fan of norfest.. it's simply located in food court no necessary and unessary interior, simple and fresh, love the food.

we order something like jaljeera green ... 5*

"by far, one of the best restaurant for north indian cuisine. it is our go to outlet for ordering food. the thalis are really fabulous(both veg and non-veg) . the quantity is more than sufficient for one person and quality has been really consistent!
they also offer lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (a typical awadhi pulaao). overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your north indian taste buds!",5,Positive
best place for authentic drool-worthy north indian food. reasonably priced and great ambience. the dal makhani was definitely the best i have had in hyderabad.,5,Positive
"being a veggie... it gets difficult to find good vegetarian food, but every time i have food from this place, its really good. i wonder how they are able to maintain consistency both in terms of quality and quantity every single time.

overall review: best place for north indian food!",5,Positive
"place is good. taste is also good but not the best. kebabs were nice except the galawati kebab it was not as good as lucknow one. the portions were quite small.
service is fast.",4,Positive
"lunch at norfest, gachibowli.
i'm a big fan of this place and love their combos.
ordered their veg. galouti kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney.
was mast mast, would have loved it to be a little more well done though.

then came the veg. combo - had 2 butter rotis with mixed veg curry (corn, carrot, peas, capsicum, potato, aloo, onion mix ) + basmati rice and daal makhani.
absolutely loved the mixed veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani üòÅ with very little daal, but tasty nonetheless üòä

norfest is now operational in pvr galleria, punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location üòä

their paratha combos are also a strong recommendation.

a perfect place to savor typical dhaba style punjabi dishes. 
a popular outlet for home delivery, however place has common food court space available for dine-in as well. 
food was served hot and tastes yumm.
chola masala : paneer was dominating the quantity of chola.",3,Neutral
"suggested by one my best friend, this place is on fire when it comes to taste north indian food! 

what we ordered : amritsari kulcha with chole, veg combo & paneer combo with a sweet lassi.

must say, the dishes were so damn yummy! being in hyderabad, i was missing good punjabi food and so was this place came to the rescue. superb taste specially the paneer sabji & the amritsari buttery kulcha! 

the food court is well ambient and had a great time!

must visit if one misses north indian food!",5,Positive
"was served very bad quality of chicken, even for the second time. they mixed kebab chicken in butter chicken and 2 to 3 varieties of chicken were mixed and chicken is half cooked and had a very bad smell",1,Very Negative
after so much of appreciations was tempted for a punjabi thali and have ordered the same. but the wait was not worth it. dal was flavoured with colours and paneer was not at all delicious and soft. wont recommend for a vegetarian punjabi thali.,1,Very Negative
"they definitely promise you a decent meal.

known for their timely delivery and packaging norfest doesn't disappoint you.

üçónonveg starter platter is more than enough for two people. perfectly cooked two pieces of tangdi kebab, malai kebab and angara kebab might not leave a lasting impression but in general they are well marinated and taste good.

üç± punjabi non veg thali is perfectly packed meal box from saladü•ó to raita.

üçõ in a non-veg thali veg curries definitely need no mention but no one can ignore dal makhani. wake up the dal makhani by stirring it as all the dal sunks to the bottom and sleeps. felt it can be a bit thicker in consistency.

ü•òbutter chicken was so delicious and mild in spicies(‚úîÔ∏è).

üç™butter rotis were hard and tough to tear - the usual packaging side effects.

ü•£boondi raita definitely needs a mention for it's delicious texture and taste and so the rice kheer.",3,Neutral
"what a place to eat! we were more than overwhelmed looking at the quantity and awesome taste of authentic north india. ordered rajma rice, amritsari kulccha with chhole, paneer, daal makhni, tandoori roti, and each and every bit of it was scrumptious. though we couldn't find our friend, pratik, there (owner of the place), we were well off enjoying our food rather than a chit chat :-d
thanks for such a great offering!",5,Positive
"ordered today veg thali via uber eats. was reading reviews and expected it to be nice. on the contrary, it was a pathetic experience. below item wise feedback:
butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. they should call it a naan actually
salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (the only.item in entire meal which i liked)
mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

hope you take some action on this and not to cheat customers with the name of authentic punjabi with some nice reviews",1,Very Negative
had the best dal makhani and butter chicken at this place in hyderabad. located in sln terminus.. on 3rd floor.. not a big place but they serve amazing punjabi food at reasonable prices.,5,Positive
"had been to this place for dinner we ordered fallout i kebab for starters that was quiet decent.for main course we ordered dal makhni,butter chicken,paneer lababdar and lacha paratha.dal makhni was good and even their butter chicken was tasty with lacha paratha.but their lababdar was not authentic.finished with sweet lassi again was not that great.overall good food.",3,Neutral

saviour for north indians",5,Positive
"after reading some good reviews went to this place by some search to reach this place. ordered punjabi non veg spl thali and amruthsari kulcha with chole. 
i wondered by looking the quantity of items. they are very small quantity. 
taste of the food is ok, not as read in the reviews it is not great. in non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy, that is spl non veg thali, great joke. vfm 1/5.  
they are not providing drinking water. a eatery/restaurant should provide the drinking water.
i have axis bank card with that they should give 15% disount, when ordering they denied it, after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste, then they gave 10% discount after arguing, they should give 15%.",1,Very Negative
"this has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. went in for lunch with my colleagues. was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

we ordered mutton galouti kebab, veg seekh kebab, paneer kadhai, butter chicken, dal tadka, tandoori rotis and jeera rice. the mutton kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

the veg seekh kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the mutton, but still held a good taste. the star for us was the butter chicken. slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. i was bowled over..! so impressed was i, that the paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! the dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that butter chicken. the only less impressive dish among the lot was the jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

in all, a very good experience. i cant say value for money, but the food was impressive in general. worth more visits, any day..! thanks.

"best punjabi food i have come across in hyderabad so far.
called for non veg kebab combo ..

kebab pieces - proper leg pieces of chicken marinated in juices of masala served with coriander chutney is damn good.

garlic naan - garlic and stretchy soft naans was pretty good.

dal makhani - had such a good dal makhani , creamy and flavoursome. it made my day.",5,Positive
"would you like to feast on north indian food in hyderabad? are you a foodie or die hard fan of butter chicken? go or order from norfest, i was deffinitely vow after having sambhar or idli for couple of days when i ordered from this place. big fan of them, tried their all outlet and i must say good pricing with awesome taste (without curry leaves :)))) in hyderabad (no offence to south indian  food).
best part is that it will not hurt your wallet badly if you compare with dhaba etd 1956 or other so called north indian restaurant.",5,Positive
"ordered the punjabi thali for lunch. it was amazing. the quantity is perfect and the food was really delicious.

the packing was really good and the rate is pocket friendly.
a must try.",4,Positive
"description of this place says authentic punjabi food, and their food corroborates this very well. we ordered their north indian special thali a few days back. 
the packaging was good and spillproof and looked appetizing. 
it had 2 vegetable dishes, one paneer, and one dal, along with zeera rice and 2 butter naan. and green mint chutney and a sweet dessert to end the meal with. the quantity was more than sufficient for one person.  each item was very tasty and kheer as dessert was the best of all.

i ordered food online but i wish i went there so that i could‚Äôve had more dishes. the food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. i had lucknow chicken dum pulao boneless and it made my day. quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you‚Äôll end up having a full tummy. hyderabadi briyani is famous but i found this on equal par with it!,5,Positive
"have been to this place and also ordered from here. this place serves one of the best awadhi and punjabi dishes in hyderabad. this is located in the food court of sln terminus mall. loved their butter chicken which went really well with tandoori roti. galouti kebab was awesome as well and went really well with the paratha served.

ordered lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as chicken today. portion size for both was a little on the lower side. the flavors and taste were awesome. as soon as the food was in the house we could smell awadhi cooking. they serve boondi raita with the pulao, this is a welcome break from the onion - tomato raita that usually comes with biryani.

"‚ö´Ô∏è this has to be my favourite punjabi restaurant in hyderabad!!! during my short trip in hyderabad,i have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! what i liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
the taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
i visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! we wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy üíÉüíÉ
so, we ended up in this restaurant!! it is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
üî¥we ordered the punjabi special vegthali:
‚Çπ269/-
it was the most delicious thali i ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
it comprises of the following:
‚ñ™Ô∏èkadai paneer (4.5/5)
paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! i have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! but, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravyüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èdum aloo (4/5)
this was the veg of the day, potatoes ü•î were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èdal makhani (4.5/5)
a punjabi thali is definitely incomplete without a dal makhani!!! it is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! the dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! it was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani i ever had!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èbundi raita (5/5)
this one stole my heart ‚ù£ i think words won‚Äôt do justice for its great taste!! i never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me i eat out a lot!!! i would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! the curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... a big thumbs up for this dish üëçüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èrice (4/5)
the zeera basmati rice üçö was definitely of the best quality!! it was big in size and was cooked so well!! each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èbutter tandoori roti (4/5)
it was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat üåæ without any hint of maida!!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èsalad (4.5/5)
fresh cucumber ü•í, carrot ü•ï and onion with a pinch of lemon üçã is definitely makes the best salad in a punjabi thali üëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èkheer (4/5)
the perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! it was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
‚ö´Ô∏è the service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! what i like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
the quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! but, i will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"okay to begin with, a 4.3 rated place in food court sounded quite fishy to me. so i was expecting a big bang surprise with their food. i had amritsari kulcha with chole, sweet lassi and shikanji.
first, coming to the people who spoke about ""authentic punjabi"" food in reviews, guys you are either out of your mind or really need to hit punjab and eat there!
shikanji was plain flavoured water that tasted medicinal, lassi was the worst one i have had lately. the amritsari kulcha and chole was tasteless. the dollop of ""butter"" didnt taste as it was meant to.
overall a very disappointing experience.",2,Negative

"authentic punjabi khana in the gachibowli area. their rajma chawal , dhaba chicken and thalis are very good. their pudina paratha and amritsari kulcha are very yummy. dal makhani is very heavy. the kheer is a must try in the deserts. the seating is limited as it‚Äôs in food court but service is fast. even home delivery packing is very good.",4,Positive

dal makhani is mouth watering and other items included in combos are also yum.",4,Positive

pulav is not properly cooked. looks colorful but tasteless. the gravy is too sweet. naan i could see the uncooked dough.",3,Neutral
"this is delhi/north india for me on a platter! good paranthas, awesome rajma-chawal and butter chicken.. definitely a must try..love this place",4,Positive
"have been there several times and have opted for delivery too.

they serve pretty good authentic north indian food. mutton rogan josh, butter chicken and dal makhni are top notch. very flavorful and authentic.

galaouti kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.

story goes that one particular nawab of lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. so galaouti‚Äòs were invented.

and the mutton galaouti‚Äôs served here, are exactly like mentioned above. very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. they are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.

pricing is very economical and occasionally they offer 50% discount too over uber eats.so, if u have a thing for north indian cuisine it's a nice place to go.",4,Positive
"loved the service, although their other outlet in madhapur has more seating available, this place is going to be worth when you visit in a group of 4-5 people. :)",3,Neutral
"one of my favs for north india food in hyderabad and within budget. the veg galauti kababs, amritsari kulcha with chole adds to the punjabi food. a nice small outlet in sln terminus food court, run by punjabis and hence the punjabi taste in the food is what makes my inner punjabi come out and relish the cusine at this place.

guys open more outlets in hyderabad its would be a great success.

"amazing food.... anyone who wants to have delicious finger licking punjabi food, must visit.

at this place they are like an outlet rather than a restaurant so it might feel a bit uncomfortable but there food will make you forget all complaints.",4,Positive
"i strongly recommend ""punjabi butter chicken"" (bone or boneless) with naan (any type)....this is the only item i order here...which is deliciously tasty.

tried veg dum pulao, and lassi also, nope...i can't even rate these items, they should remove these items from there menu.

for me, this dhaba is brand ambassador for ""punjabi butter chicken"" :-)",4,Positive
"been here to this place many a times till now and it has never disappointed. i have also ordered food online from here many times. whenever i am hungry and i want to eat good punjabi food, this has been my go-to place in gachibowli. recently a second outlet was opened in madhapur also.
i have tasted almost every item here, like paneer butter masala, matar mushroom, dal makhni, amritsari kulcha with chole, lucknowi chicken dum pulav, murgh tikka masala, punjabi special veg / non-veg thali, rajma chawal etc.,
my best picks are matar mushroom, paneer butter masala, punjabi special veg thali, punjabi butter chicken to name a few.
i was disappointed with the rajma chawal though.

the best thing about this place is its consistency in taste which it maintains.
overall it was a great experience and i would rate this as 4.5/5 for its food.",5,Positive
"best food spot located in sln terminus. the food quality is great, although some dishes were bit sweeter than i expected.

"food is worth the hype! expect a crowd.

i ordered a chicken dum pulao and it was the best thing i ate in my 6 days stay at hyderabad! everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. though a little expensive, they were worth it. there were ample pieces of chicken.
only things i‚Äôd complain about would be pudina chutney and the quantity of rice.

this is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (sln terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. good food and the close proximity to it companies attract a crowd. you can order online to avoid the rush.",5,Positive

"the best place for having authentic north indian food. amritsari kulcha with chole, butter naan with dal makhani..you won't find it better than here. the galouti kebabs were too yummy and had the typical 'melt in mouth' functionality.",5,Positive
"had the panneer of the day combo here. it was matar panner,dal makhani. needless to say one of the best cooked dal makhani and matar paneer i ever tasted. it was a bit pricey but the taste was totally worth it. norfest has set a new bench mark for how dal makhani and panneer dishes are to be made.

the only thing i can complain about is the quantity. for 240 i felt that what i had on my plate was really less.",4,Positive
"this place is part of the food court in sln terminus. they maintain proper hygiene and service is also good.

coming to the food, we ordered paneer combo in which they serve paneer curry, rice, dal makhni and 2 roti. quantity is sufficient for 1 person. the best part of the meal was their dal makhni. it was just wow. paneer curry was good in taste but it had little strong flavour of tadka.

i also had amritsari kulcha with chole. it was good in taste. also, tried their lassi and sikanji. lassi was delicious but sikanji was totally opposite. it was not refreshing as it should be.

overall, we had nice experience, and recommendable place to have food in sln terminus.

ordered punjabi spcl veg thali & rajma chawal through uber eats. received generous 50% off.

rajma chawal was also great.",4,Positive

garlic naan: good",4,Positive
"it's serves one of the best punjabi food in hyderabad, the galouti kabab will melt in your mouth as soon as you will eat it.
the deserts are not good though but still it will remind you of northe indian taste.",4,Positive
"the spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal, including me, set about while writing a review, scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had.
on such a rare occasion, i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this.
since the time i shifted to hyderabad, i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant.
spicy, hot and tangy became a common thing. and here comes norfest, like a strong and quiet gallant hero, who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon.

the mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where, street food sellers scream in the humid heat, ushering people to come in to their food haven. it was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again. the nuts on top were a nice touch.

we also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and i, a slow eater, finished it in seconds. i still remember the taste in my mouth, tandoori chicken, soft and creamy gravy with warm rice.
the dal makhani, i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken, but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added.
i, a pure non vegetarian, became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums, carrots and corn. the gravy enveloping it was amazing.
the thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it.
the kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip.
it was sweet, the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch.
talking about it, i am definitely reordering it tomorrow. kudos",5,Positive

most terrible place. i used to love chennai 10d and with that brand i went to hyd 10d. firstly they took cover charge for a couple and they had no seats. could have told us we have no seats we would not have paid cover charge. we stood for good 20 mins and then given bad seats near the speaker where one couldn't even talk! and then the waiters weren't serving us food properly. had to ask them twice after whicj they took order and when they did they didn't give us cutlery. can you even imagine??? i had to ask that give forks !!!!!!! i had the worst experience ever of going to a place. extremely disappointed. please learn how to manage a crowd. also i wanted to book my table beforehand. but the option was not even available on zomato and they won't pick up call. it just felt they didn't want things to be systematic. extremely disappointed.,1,Very Negative

"vegetarian review ~

this is my go to place when i randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer. i don't remember how many times i have been here. on the 10th floor, the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful, the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated, though i personally like outdoors. the dance floor is a little small but hey the dj has to be good right!!

with their whole ranged of brewed beers - 4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide. i like ale above all. we combined it with honey chilli potato, dahi ke kababs, baby corn tempura.
honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish.
dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney.
lasagne is good and pasta is so so and i didn't like it that much. food is average here but a glass of beer and one won't mind. wines are not that great too so go for beer üòú

the staff is good and friendly. the price is a bit on expensive side i would say. there are minimal cover charges for the pub. the embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it's fun.

the dj is amazing and i always had great time shaking my leg on the floor. so it's a must go if u still haven't been here. üòç",4,Positive
i‚Äôm not a huge fan of buffet but i‚Äôve been here only to taste the dishes and they were great and had a variety. this place is for family get togethers. you‚Äôll enjoy the food by its taste and variety and you get food chocked love at the live counters. i‚Äôve been here a long time ago but i still remember my time here. i‚Äôm giving this only three stars only coz i‚Äôm not a fan of buffet.,3,Neutral

"this place has treated me with great warmth every time i have stepped in. as soon as you enter the pleasant attitude of the staff is something that overwhelms me. the doorman, mr. gaikwad, pinkky has always been there to answer all questions. all the waiters have been cordial and pleasant with me, to mention a few names... venkat, pradeep, pradhan, mahesh and all the others whose names i do not remember. special thanks to john blessie for his warm hugs and welcoming smile makes every visit memorable. sudhakar you 're great a man of sheer intelligence and ideas.

keep up the good work & keep those smiles on our faces... kudos to the staff.",5,Positive
"absolutely loved the place! it's has a nice classic touch compared to the 10d in begumpet which has become too crowded and lost it's charm.
you would change your opinion about 10d if you visit this place in gachibowli.
rooftop open air ambience, with comfy seating.
service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a friday night. they also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. the entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
staff are courteous and know their menu well. do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
it's got a separate dance floor and bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! they play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
overall it's one of the best i've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.
tip : do try their in-house beers, there are 4 varieties of them. you can get a sample tray of all flavours, so that you can taste each type and choose whichever you like.",4,Positive

food is exceptionally amazing. to all the non-veg lovers,chicken lasagna is bae.

4/5 because the staff aren't courteous and they dont respond quickly and we had to call them multiple times to just take the order.",4,Positive
"vegetarian review: heard a lot about this place and it did not disappoint me. the only thing that bothered me was the loud music ( i am not talking about the dance floor ), it was so loud that we had to scream to be audible. the dance floor was also decent. food was amazing, i did not expect such good food at this place.
note: i heard that they are charging rs. 80 per mineral water bottle.

"to spend a nice evening after office hours, we visited this place and occupied a table in the open area of it.

the weather was nice and thus, we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it.

in drinks, we had hot toddy, brewed beer, fruit punch, pinnacolada and many other mocktails. all of these were good but there was nothing special about them.

in food, we had masala omelette, loaded nachos, cottage cheese fingers, mushroom tikka, fish and chicken wings.

loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them.

overall, the place is nice but the food and drinks were okayish in comparison to the other places in town.",3,Neutral

well another brew in town. 2nd 10 d in the town . the one at begumpet the oldest and class. apart from the old rest of the class remains same. being a brewery s an additional advantage with this place. i loved all of them. they have outdoor seating which will amazing in the evenings but you guys need prior reservation for sure .,4,Positive
"we went here for lunch on a girls day out and were amazed with the classy ambiance and decor.

first thing that made us happy was the interiors and the way the place was done.

we tried veg platter for starters which was delicious. the quantities was just right for two people.

we enjoyed some mocktails alongside and a bowl of corns.

the place is a bit expensive but i think it's worth it as we loved the food and the ambiance.

we certainly would love to revisit it on a date night and enjoy the rooftop experience. at the time we went the rooftop was closed as some renovations were going on.

highly recommended!",4,Positive

"being close to my house sln terminus is one place i have often visited be it serifina ( that got closed) or the lal street or mystery rooms or 10d . it's a happening place and worth a visit.

have been to 10d quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. i would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.

we visited once over a weekend, once during the christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. the best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.

ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. my favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.

service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. the staff is courteous and quick to attend

food - definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.

drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and liit is worth giving a try

overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
friday night or sunday night is what i would recommend. and yes the more the merrier... you are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

"good place to hang out with family and friends. i tried couple of cocktails and shots. cocktails were not strong at all. so it was more of plain juice. i would recommend that in the cocktails menu the should also mention in details what's the base and also the content of alcohol.

starters were great.. i ordered chinese platter and i was really nice.
music was loud and lively.",4,Positive

"my friend and i visited this place on the 13th of january around 1920 hrs and ordered your strong ale, we believe that the beer was coughed into and we both fell severly sick with a scratchy throat and dry cough. i dont know why dont your employees wear a mask when on duty because i do not think i will ever return to you guys and this was my second trip to you and the second trip made me fall sick. i will spread it like wild fire for others before they fall sick, i can understand only one person falling sick but both falling sick with the same symptoms after consuming the strong ale beer then there is something definiately wrong and i am certain that the beer we were served was unhygienic or was contaminated beacsue on my visit on the 8th of jan i never fell sick with the strong ale it was on the 13th that my friend and i fell sick . second, ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes? your staff would stand on my head to make sure i am not smoking pot and are you serious?? i use fresh tobacco like american spirit and roll my cigarettes and never expected this kind of survelance upon rolling a cigarette and taking my loose tobacco original pouch packing to smell that it is not pot, i feel humilated. train your staff on hygiene and educate them.


ps: my first visit was on the 8th jan and just fyi across the globe beer sampling is not chargable hence they are called samples.",1,Very Negative
we had an evening office party here and that too on a friday. the atmosphere was lively and the terrace view was sublime. the food tasted good though people won't visit the place for the same. a bit heavy on the pricing side but it was worth it.,4,Positive
"went there on a friday, we were only stags but we went there early, at about 6pm. the environment was very energetic, we had great conversations until night and then went to the dance floor. the dj was amazing, a good mix of english and hindi songs. had one of my best night outs here! it was a little on the expensive side though, for 3 people the bill was 9k rs.",5,Positive

"an amazing place for partying and that much needed respite after a tiring day of work.
10downing is the brand well known across the breadth and width of the country offers exciting pub lunches and some awesome parties.
this 10d is unique in it's own ways and has a brewery unit attached to it so it is a bonus in terms of the variety on offer for the alcoholics.
have been to this place on a few occasions once to taste the brews and another visit was for a pub lunch which comes with a glass of draught beer.
my suggestions: chicken lasagne, shepard's pie,roast lamb and a lot more
must admit the pub lunch here is one of the best and the brews are brilliant to pair with some food.
overall it is a gem of a place with amazing views,great food choices and a decent collection of drinks to offer you a complete package.",5,Positive

if you've never been here, go right away!

must have: lasagne (10d serves one of the best lasagne ever), jeera rice and mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka, chicken nachos and spaghetti bolognese.

cons: wine options are bad, that's the only thing i actually regret. but, if you love beer, you'll get lucky.",5,Positive
we happened to visit this place with office frenz and trust me the rooftop was awesome..the staff was courteous and everything was well managed..we had loads of fun and the food was tasty! i keep visiting this place and always will!,4,Positive
"a very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset. üôà

i have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations.
the ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that! it has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live!
coming to food and service, i would rate it 1/5. we tried the jalape√±o cheese poppers, horrible taste- so much so we had to leave some of it. we had the vegetarian pizza- served burnt at the base! on asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one. only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark. the service was literally horrible, being a sunday everyone was just chilling on their own i guess ü§£ü§™

i would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place.",3,Neutral
"while the food is pretty similar and standard to their begumpet outlet, the ambience is worthy of a mention here.
the service is definitely better.

do up your game with some of the dishes though.",4,Positive

"a grand entry, decent ambience and average food. that just about sums it up for 10 downing street.
just as the name suggests, the place has a very british feel to it as far as the ambience goes. it's cost, warm and has great layout. but the layout proves to be a negative as well. we went here for lunch and the place was very loud. the good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view. the service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive. i hope they write down what was ordered.
the food itself was good. we had chicken wings, chicken tikka, seekh kabab, tandoori veg platter and drinks. the food was good and arrived a tad slow. overall, it is a good place to have a drink and be merry.",3,Neutral
"great place and a really amazing crowd. the ambiance, service, and food are altogether great.
there is a variety in terms of permutations of drinks that this place has to offer.

"meh!!! straight up. heard from a friend that this is apparently rated the best pub in hyderabad, but living in bangalore for 25 years and boston for 5, this place is way over priced to start! food is good don't get me wrong, but this place is clearly taking your money for the service and ambience which is so genuinely ""meh""! for example asked for a bottle of water which apparently takes about 20 mins",2,Negative

we have visited this place multiple times for lunch. it had now become our go to restaurant for casual team lunches.. the pub lunch menu has quite a few options to choose from and all the items are pretty good. you also get a glass of her or wine or a mojito to choose from. the moon drinkers also have an option to go for a soup or chose a cold drink with the food.. the best part is the food and the service has been consistently good!!!!,4,Positive

"this outlet located on 10th floor of sln terminus, is our team dinner venue.rlrestaurant had a decent ambience, but open top can have some more mild lighting. brewery is available. but as we booked a buffet in bulk , we got limited options for food and alcohol

food has got 2 veg plus 4 non veg appetisers.
main course was very limited. biryani's and gravy each one for veg and non veg. tandoori rotis and nans. desserts were very limited. vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun.

alcohol has 4 options. bacardi white rum, antiquity whisky, smirnoff vodka and kf beer.
mocktails, cool drinks,soda and fruit juice available for mixing. loud music with divine drinks on breezy roof top is definitely worth a try.",3,Neutral
"this is my go to place for comfort lunches within a budget. you‚Äôll simply have to love their cracking rice and chicken lasagne cause they are to die for.
i love how they always give a drink with this set menu.
the red shredded chicken and crackling rice along with their lasagne were a perfect match for each other.
i‚Äôve also had the chicken nachos which were alright but their lunch menu is a must try.",4,Positive

"around 11 of us went to this place to have lunch, located a great place in gachibowli.
the ambience of the place is great and so was the hospitality.
coming to food, ordered two non veg platters, all the items in the platter were great but when the quantity is compared to the cost,its little disappointing but they entirely make it up with their taste and quality. beers were good, but they not at all strong, we can drink it like cold water.
the main course was spread across continental, chinese and indian. from continental side, we ordered pasta, lasagne and a fish. again the quantity was less but quality was great. from chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawns.in indian we ordered, peshawari chicken, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken. all these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts.

the main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch. best enjoyed when visited with max 3-4 ppl.

really good place in gachibowli. ambience is average. but good place with good vibes and crowd. they have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. they have a dance floor. there are karaoke nights as well. on weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. entry is from side in the building sln terminus. lunch menus are bad. food is just average here. most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. overall worth a visit. good place to enjoy music and have fun.,4,Positive

"i have been to quite a few similar places in hyderabad and after a lot of hype about this place, finally on the monday night we visited this place for a team dinner and needless to say that it was a really enthralling experience.
starting from the reception area *( especially that guy with a moustache... you made the night with your behavior).
after entering the lounge, it kinda of creates a pleasant view with all the interior decorations.
the service was good starting from the starters to the drinks and main course and finally the desserts.
but at the end of the night it was the dj guy who outperformed everyone. you will be the one who will make me to come to this place again and again. being from north india, finally got the chance to dance to those punjabi songs listening to which i have grown. danced with the heart in my palm. needless to say that the dj guy was the icing on the cake with his song selections.
in short, a happening place and if it's your day then these small things will just make your night.",5,Positive

taste : we specifically told the manager to server less spicy items and my parents really liked the kabab items and a chicken main course.
service : that time i think only 4-5 table filled. but they are very late in serving and the waiter even not listening after a multiple time about serving (e.g veg  or non-veg. no rice to parent). he just did what he thought. then i started to serve till manger came for rescue..ha ha... 1 star less for this. in one word it's un-professionalism.

checked out the menu and found chicken afghani, pepper chicken to be their favorites. ordered these, though zomato, however, zomato ruined it with delivery part the food was worth the wait.

the chicken afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice. the pepper chicken was bit over fried, however, tasty with right blend of species.

the gravy was unique because i had chicken afghani in other restaurants but pakwaan has their own way of presenting it.

"outlet was once a treat for the punjabi dishes, but over the period of time, the quality is going down and the so-called ‚Äògoooooddessst‚Äô taste has been missing the mark more than once.
yesterday ordered for one portion of puri-choley and one portion of puri-alu. the puris were fat and oily. the alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. our breakfast was definitely spoiled. in my last order of rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. i really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.
wish the management will work upon the food quality. because at this rate, they‚Äôre losing out on loyal customers.",1,Very Negative

the chole masala was not okay. but the paneer curry was delicious with paratha.

in the mood for some authentic punjabi food, headout to 13 dhaba to taste lipsticking and finger licking food. my personal favorite is the dal makhani. the combos are worth a special mention here.

"we had been wanting to visit 13 dhaba for quite some time, having heard the raving reviews about their north indian preparations. finally ended up trying their steaming hot, gobsmacking parathas and they're truly some of the best you can find in hyderabad üòç

the aloo tawa paratha is actually stuffed with loads of filling as compared to other places that serve doughy parathas. the paneer kulcha was also smothered in butter and served with onions and curd.
we ordered the small aloo paratha but it was ginormous and we were almost full by the time we were done with it ü§≠

they serve other north indian delicacies like rajma chawal, kadhi chawal, dal makhni and lassi which are on our to-try list.",4,Positive

"located near the gachibowli orr circle ""13 dhaba"" is easily accessible. they had a wide variety of parathas and north indian dishes. we had taken gobhi paratha and aloo-kulcha both tasted great. the ambience is not that good as it just a roadside stop. overall for a quick eatery, this can be bookmarked.",4,Positive

i agree... they provide food better than ordinary. but i would definitely not recommend people to order from here. they provided incomplete order which is ok... it can happen. but over that they were not responsible too... their behaviour is very rude which is not professional. it sounded as if it's my fault not theirs.,1,Very Negative
"okay, so i am not a veg person usually, but then, it was raksha bandhan yesterday, and i had to abide by the rules. now, thinking of punjabi restaurants or dhabas, we usually picturize sinfully delicious non-veg dishes. but 13 dhaba is an amazing pure veg punjabi restaurant, and trust me, the food there won't let you down.

on my plate: buttery aloo paratha||paneer makhani||raita

the paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha. so imagine how ginormous is. the stuffing was perfect, neither too less, nor too much. the paneer was very softly cooked and absorbed the flavors of the spices, and the gravy too was amazing. the raita, with a bit of pepper in it added to the beauty of the lunch.",4,Positive
"i am giving a bad rating not to the restaurant but because of zomato... everytime i order food the instructions are not properly relayed to the restaurant and i end up getting something which i can't eat(for example spicy or with onions). they simply refuse to cancel the order and even if i ping them separately everytime they say ""system gitch"" .. very bad delivery service by zomato. zomato clearly doesn't care about it customers but may be they will listen to the restaurants may be because, due to zomato restaurant's name is going for a sale here...",1,Very Negative
"amazing taste. ordered chole, paneer dish and almost all the naans. quantity is also good compared to the price. lassi and milk thandai were not so good. but the most important thing why i wouldn't rate it high is it's self service policy. the place is too small and even water isn't served. not even tissue papers.",3,Neutral

"got to know about this by watching uber eats vedio and mouth publicity. perfect place for a punjabi family and authentic punjabi food lovers.

the paneer tikka i had here is the best i ever had till date, it was totally cooked and servered with butter over. paratas are huge enought to serve one and tests your appettite, stuffing is very good served with butter over and masala ratia.
reccommend to go with a group so that you can taste all togeather.

combos and different rice items available. special 10% discount for bicycle and bullet riders. self service so get your food own service is too good the person treat with huge respect. worth visiting the place.",4,Positive

full marks on food, none on service. ambience is that of a typical restaurant in a fancy hotel (you know what i mean).",4,Positive
worst experience with this hotel. food taste was very bad. no attention from servers. we even doesn't know that there are rotis and icecream. no one bothered to serve. only peanuts was good among all the food. but for peanuts 1000 bugs is too much. and most special thing is a tile from wall fell down where a customer missed it in a inch. plz don't sit at the last.,1,Very Negative
"not recommended for sure.. average quality and highly overpriced. took eternity to serve chapati, that too cold ones.. desserts were good as they have menu options.
overall disappointed.",1,Very Negative

"went to this amazing place quite sometime back. it's a very pretty, romantic place for a fine dining experience.

great food, service and hospitality. they had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! i'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! better to reserve a table in advance.

lovely taste in food. delicious mushroom soup and the quattro formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

must try: forest mushroom soup, crispy corn pepper salt, quattro formaggi, tiramisu

would actually give it a 4.5/5",4,Positive

"visited with family for dinner on a special occasion.
the valet parking was a relief.
unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
the ambience was great - i loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.

the food was really good. the sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.

service however was lacking on all parameters. it was cold and inefficient. it was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). the billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.

the food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.

"been to this place twice-once with friends and ordered ala carte and other with collegues for a buffet- loved both the experiences. the food here is really good.unlike others, i will start with the dessert-love their creme brule the best and followed by their baked cheesecakes..have tried their chickn burgers, pizzas and thai cuisine as well--i loved the burgers the best, followed by thai curry..buffet was less impressive than ala carte but was happy with the variety-whic included hyderabadi cuisine apart form meditteranean...must place to visit in hydereabad.",4,Positive
"went for lunch with friends...ala carte. liked the ambience,though it was really far to get to!! we had the caesar salad, which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning; pizza arabiata-really nice, crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty! penne pasta-chicken was also good, though the chicken seemed dry. the best dish was thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice-the best ever flavours-a must try!! now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.
there was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders. overall it was a nice experience, hope to have a better one next time.",3,Neutral
"i think there is no point of taking a buffet here. i took a buffet for the purpose of having mutton curry; but it was spoilt. hence, there was no benefit from paying 2000 for 2 people.

jonathan kitchen had been on my check list for quite some time.. i was very happy when we finally went over a weekend for the buffet..

the early impressions were not great as it seemed very crowded and the ambiance wasnt bright which aroused a non positive vibe.. as we dint want to go to another restaurant at that time.. we proceeded to have the buffet..

except for the desserts section which was huge, i was disappointed with the overall quality of the food.. the taste want great and at the same time, the meat had a lot of bones.. service was bad.. there was always a shortage of plates and the dessert spoon they gave me was the highlight of the whole experience.. ü§£",2,Negative
"this is by far the best buffet option on weekdays.

the spread is wonderful and quite enjoyable for vegetarians. i loved the pizza and some of the continental starters.

the main course options were also wonderfully flavorful.

and the desert spread also had more than a dozen options.

not for the weight watchers :)",5,Positive
"a great place for pleasant evening dinner, not too noisy.

we ordered a pizza and risotto, pizza was great lots of veggies and nice crispy crust. risotto was nice and had good texture, not an expert on risotto but liked it overall.

quality of service is really good though very few people know details about the menu like which dishes are recommended etc.

the ambiance good and pretty much similar to any fine dining restaurant except wobbling chairs.

i found service quite quick and clean. food was brought to table right on time. the quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money.

everything i tried were perfectly done and delivered.

"i was invited to this place by one of my friends to have a dinner and experience the hospitality that jonathan's kitchen provide.

let me talk about the ambience , the place is very well designed and maintained. the lighting at the place is very warm and cosy. perfect place to have a romantic outing as well as family time.

now coming to food , for the starters we ordered tiger prawns , butter garlic prawns , mutton sikampuri kebab, crispy corn.

out of all the butter garlic prawns were the highlight. i'd go back to this place just for butter garlic prawns.

for the main course we ordered beef steak and rice and dal tadka, though i am not a fan of beef and i don't eat , my friends told that it was too good. dal tadka was awesome.

overall this is a perfect place to have dinner and lunch , i'd definately recommend this.",5,Positive
ordered achari paneer tikka through dwight and for a restaurant that claims to be a top notch restaurant and charges exorbitant rates for the same....they sent stale stinky paneer tikka which had to be thrown in the dustbin. extremely disappointed. money lost and no replacement provided from the restaurant....not worth it!,1,Very Negative

one of the best buffets you can have in hyd is at jonathan's kitchen. a very calm place with a beautiful ambience. every dish will make you realize that you didn't do any mistake by coming at this place. this is a to-go place for every one

we had few mocktails like :

ornge delight : likely to boost u in this weather.

cucumber & mint

virgin pinacolada

spicy tango

blue lagoon

now coming to food :

grilled pomfret

chilli chicken - this was good, neither spicy nor less

crispy corn - this was crispy with onion added in it. if you love corn then you're gonna enjoy this.

thai basil chicken wings

chicken wonton

nawabi shikampur kebabs - this was perfectly prepared kebabs with pudina chutney was delicious

butter garlic prawns i loved them as prawns are my fav.

dragon prawns - the name itself defines dragons

dal tadka

rara ghosht

amritsari kulcha n butter naan was yummmmm

burnt fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy

this combination can never be wrong, as i feel everyone love this combination.

deserts :

one can never end their meal without a desert.

gulab jamun - this is a favorite one.

chocolate jamun with ice cream - a hot choclate brownie topped with ancold ice cream. when you eat this. its so amazing in taste. and everyone who's going to order this would love this desert.

a decent place overall. it has a nice ambience though it can get pretty crowded and noisy during peak hours. the menu is pretty wide-ranged. we ordered a couple of appetizers and a pasta in main course. appetizers were not very good. chilli broccoli was too oily. however the pasta was really good.,4,Positive
my steak experience here was a lovely one. though i asked for medium rare done steak i was served a well done chunk of chewey meat that i didn't appreciate. the sides however were perfectly made and impressed me all on their own. the light and brightly lit interiors with white flowy curtains that never allow harsh sunlight to make eye contact make this place lovely for a laid back brunch. the eatery has an aura of tranquility that you simply cannot deny.,4,Positive
"i have heard lot about the place but finally tonight i managed to visit it. they have an interesting and a wide range of a la carte menu and thats what we all were hoping to try out.
the ambiance is similar as of any fine dining restaurant.
i heard reviews about their service being a bit slower, but luckily i did not experience that tonight (might be due to the lesser rush on a weekday night), rather i found the service quite good.
the quantity of the dishes served did justice to the term value for money.

recommendations:
blackened salmon steak
rib eye steak (one of the very few places in hyderabad where they served an actual medium rare steak!!)
sirloin steak
cilantro fish
jumbalaya
cheese cake with blue berry compote",4,Positive
"it was a lovely experience. we ordered kimchi fried rice and exotic assorted veggies with chili basil sauce. loved both of them. they were properly cooked . mushrooms in kimchi fried rice were just delicious.

"went on a saturday night. nice cosy place,well lit and classy ambiance. opted for a'la carte as we had a snack on our way. we were in a little early and found ourselves a good place to sit. ordered a burger and pizza. both were lip smacking. portion size was huge. absolute vfm. zomato gold helps keep the place pocket friendly :) will surely visit again.",5,Positive
"i have visited jonathan's kitchen on many occasions. one thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant, their service is not so nice. also, they denied us zomato gold services saying we were sitting in komatose, however as per their front staff, they told us to sit in komatose as they didn't have seat in jonathan's kitchen but the food, menu and staff will all be from jonathan's. hence we sat and ordered and later, found out, no gold accepted.
i have tried their buffet, ala cart, sushi and everything else, nothing extraordinary. the only benefit is, it is close to my place.",3,Neutral

did not enjoy our evening at all. just realised not to order sushi if it's not an authentic japanese restaurant. nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice.. i made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. waiters were very transactional. told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. they had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. we'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. none of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. why do i bring this up? cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience.,2,Negative

"a peaceful n quite place is something u want after a hectic schedule where u can spend some quality time with friends or family that relaxes u for sometime.....even i wanted to relax n take a break from my hectic schedule.......one or two days later few of my friends invited me to this place n was delighted to know this place n it was perfect for me as i exactly wanted to head to a place similar to this......believe me guyz it's an awsome place n definitely u will fall in love with it.......

lets begin with drinks first

they served so many mocktails like

orange delight had amazing blend of vit c to give u the boost in this hot weather

cucumber n mint very refreshing to beat the heat n taste was good too

virgin pina colada not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n i'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a no no for me

black currant tasted good

spicy tango had a tinge of masala like jaljeera n a dash of spiciness dat had a pinching sensation on the throat.....little different n can be taken

blue lagoon as the name says it's a blue colored drink dat had blue caracao syrup added with few lemon wedges n mint leaves.....tasted realllllyyy good

food

grilled pomfret
a big fat good looking pomfretüòã marinated with an awsome blend of very basic n flavorful spices n grilled to perfection....served with mint yogurt dip along with onion rings n lemon wedges.......fish was full of flavors with each bite giving superb taste n it was fresh as the taste of fish meat was very good n not at all smelly......well presented n deliciousüëå

chilli chicken
chunks of boneless chicken coated with batter n fried till golden brown,tossed in a chilli soy based sauce with onion,cubed capsicum,dry red chillies n spring onion stalks topped with handful of cashews n raw cabbage.....overall tasted very good n chicken was perfectly cooked n the sauce that was coating it was fab too...

crispy corn
crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz üëç

thai basil chicken wings
when chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious

chicken wonton
minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....

nawabi shikampuri kebab
usually shikampur is flat round shape n filled with yogurt,but here it was in a round ball shape filled with yogurt n onion dip.....shikampur was cooked very well n was going very well with the mint sahi chutney n onions on the side...

dragon prawns
crispy fried prawns tossed in red chili n garlic sauce

butter garlic prawns
by far one of the best butter garlic prawns i had till now.....crispy fried prawns tossed in a velvety buttery n garlicky sauce with onions n spring onion stalks topped with sesame seeds n raw cabbage......üëå

tiger prawns
jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good

dal tadka
well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious

rara gosht
minced meat gravy dat was delicious n spices did not overpower the whole dish which was the best part of this dish

butter naan n amristsari kulcha tasted yummmmm

burnt fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy
this combo can never go wrong.....both the dishes complimented each other n it tasted fab!!!

desserts

gulab jamun
perfect rounds of gulab jamun served with sugar syrup n sprinkled with chopped almonds wer yummmmmm
perfectly cooked with just the right color

creme brulee
it consists of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar....... it was served slightly chilled topped with plenty of fruit cuts n presented with apple slices by the side.......
it was different from other places n tasted yummm

chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream
when a warm choco lava cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with loadz of chocolate sauce n dusted with powdered sugar den there is nothing else u want in ur lifeüòã

service was on point.....staff was very polite n humble
delivered each n every item with punctuality n was never rude even if we asked something too many times....good team

finally would like to recommend this place to people who would like to spend some quality time with family,friends or der loved ones in a peaceful n quite place accompanying with some delectable food.....even very good to conduct ur business meetings.....overall it's convenient for everyone.........do visit this place n njoy üòÅ",4,Positive

"i love the food here they have a great spread for their buffet. however i have never had the buffet so i wouldn‚Äôt comment on the taste, but the spread is definitely good cz i checked that out. i come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their fish items from the grill section. i have had the blackened salmon steak, cilantro fish and the murrel crust and have loved each one. however, if i had to pick one it would be the salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. apart from their fish i love their spring chicken and chicken confit as well. if you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.

coming to the ambiance, it‚Äôs minimalistic and chic. the staff is polite and warm. they have a zomato gold offer on food, so that‚Äôs amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side. i definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly.",5,Positive
"i have been there for quite a few time now, for brunch, ala cart as well as only for dessert.

brunch- they do have a hell variety of items and i am sure you won't be able to taste them all...i liked their starters very much which had egg options, pan cakes, sautee vegetables, idly, dosa and many more.it was fulfilling in itself.if you also love brunch than it is definitely worth trying and value for money.

dessert- i went their only for dessert once and had tiramisu and chocolate ganache...both of them tasted amazing...except tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving.

one of the worst places to visit ...horrible experience... we waited for 45 min after placing our order and then walked out of the place without eating anything... first they misplaced the order at a time when there was only two other busy tables and then they had the audacity to come with a pizza and offer us and then realize that it was for someone else...,1,Very Negative
"best place ever jonathan's kitchen

if you are near gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so i recommend you the best place is jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. i really loved this place from it‚Äôs ambiance to food and service, everything‚Äôs top notch.

it was wednesday night and we were near gachibowli and really hungry, when i suggested we will visit jonathan's kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. i was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters grilled pomfret, chili chicken , crispy corn , chicken wings, nawabi shikampuri kebab, dragon prawns and tiger prawns. all of the starters were the best, i have never tried such before anywhere. now that the starting was the best, i promise at the end it will be a blast.

grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. it was so good! chili chicken wasn‚Äôt much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. crispy corn i have tried at many restaurants and i loved flechazo‚Äôs before, but now i can say the best crispy corn is at jonathan's kitchen. i think this is the best compliment. chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!

then my favorite part were the prawns. here we tried 3 different types of prawns, butter garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, mr. tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. it is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, tiger prawns; these were too large in size, i have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.

then we ordered some mocktails because it‚Äôs mandatory; orange delight ,cucumber n mint, virgin pina colada ,black current, spicy tango and blue lagoon or blue heaven. every mocktail has their own specialty. orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. black current is really good in taste and refreshing. spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. every mocktail is best at jonathan's kitchen.

then it‚Äôs time for main course, in that we ordered dal tadka and rara gosht with butter naan and amritsari kulcha, and burnt fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy. every dish just left us speechless! dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and amritsari kulcha. burnt fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at jonathan's kitchen.

but without dessert, i never end my dinner. so here we ordered gulab jamun, chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and cream brulee with fresh fruits. all the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.

thanks to mr. rashid for the lovely dinner at jonathan's kitchen. thanks to the entire team of jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to surrender and chef vijay.

"one of hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, jonathan's kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. the luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. i was here for a tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.

we started off with some amazing starters; butter garlic prawns, grilled pomfret, dragon prawns, crispy corn pepper salt, chicken wonton and nawabi shikampuri kebab. the prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. grilled pomfret was also very good. crispy corn were the best that i've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. chicken wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. lastly, the nawabi shikampuri kebab were very juicy and succulent.

next we had some of the finest mocktails; orange delight, cucumber n mint, virgin pina colada, black currant, spicy tango and blue lagoon or blue heaven. all of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. although virgin pina colada wasn't that great, and orange delight the best.

we had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. it is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.

then we savored rara gosht and dal tadka curries with butter naan and amritsari kulcha. both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. lastly, we had fried rice with schezwan chicken gravy. this was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky indo chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.

we ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic gulab jamun, a fruity creme brulee, and a luscious chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream. a perfect end to an amazing dinner. we had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again.",5,Positive

worst service i ever experienced. if we order an item no one take responsibility to bring it. they will stay at the corner and chit chat each other. there was a lady i said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. they will replace items after 20min. we have to wait for that item. even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. at last i feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and i find an cockroache in the bowl i called the lady and waiter they did not responded. then i went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 ice creams. we were around 30 people. and he saying to come in the evng or next day. i don't know what they think about the customers. basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. at least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. i heard lot about jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good. but the people their behaviour and neatness was very very bad. kindly find the attachment. thank you and i never visit u.,2,Negative
"writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of hyderabad- jonathan's kitchen

went to celebrate my bday today..it was the worst food buffet i ever had in any above average costly restaurant.they charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. ambience- even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. no theme no decoration
2. service- no serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. food- the worst part of it..some stale starters of chicken and fish. veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.one chicken starter only had some taste. main course is also pretty below average.pasta is good.pizza(so called best hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
two juices as welcome drinks were ok.

i gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.thanks for that.

they themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..will do that if i will ever try to take this risk againüòú",2,Negative

had a great lunch. the buffet spread was good. very good for office parties. desserts were good too. rice varieties were too less. ambiance is nice.,4,Positive
"ambience: 5/5 (both indoors and outdoors facility)
value for money: 3.5/5 (this is with respect to sunday brunch# costing rs. 1200/- per person)
staff service: 5/5

quality of food: 5/5 simply premium.items i like the most are veg. maki (sushi), broccoli salad* from their regular menu.but even more outstanding are their live counter options such as tawa fish (not your regular bland bone-less fish, but the way you eat fish at home) had some real flavour. omelette, french toast, pancakes were simply brilliant.
variety of food: 5/5 enormous.this is where jonathan's kitchen truly excels, there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with. they claim to have over 60 items on their menu, which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table.
#in the name of unlimited drinks, there was no real variety to choose from. i couldn't even get my favourite soft drink thums up (franchise issue probably, i know), and on that particular day, there wasn't any option of pina colada.
*i am a big fan of lettuce leafs. please keep some.",4,Positive
"i went there for lunch on a sunday afternoon. four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for √† la carte. i was among the two who went for √† la carte. for the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. the ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. the starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. personally, i felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. the air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as i expected it to be. however, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
coming to the food, i had ordered mutton sukha, rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. my companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. all the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. coming to the √† la carte menu, the mutton sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. the rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. on the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of saut√©d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.
overall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world.",4,Positive
"lousy staff and lousy service. i went for dinner buffet and except a few things i didn't like anything. the deserts were really really bad. with so many options and none of them were good.
the only good thing is the ambience. i don't recommend this place at all.",3,Neutral
"this is one of the best place if you are looking for a quiet calm place for dinner or lunch .the ambiance is great,staff is excellent and food is to the point. the buffet has nice variety in salads,starters and desert.main course is average in buffet but a la carte is amazing. the quality of everything served is great.i luv going back to this place.",4,Positive
"jonathon's kitchen was my yesterday's visit and it was good on part of food ...could be excellent if little more they will work on food ...it's ambience is very goo you can sit outside or inside...they have bar area... service is fast..they are always ready to serve you...food varieties are many but little it lacks on taste...for vegetarian people like me they an add some more things or can work a little more on taste...deserts they will kill you with lots of varieties..if you are on diet don't go..haha jokes apart they have good variety of deserts...few were too gud like gulabjamun, rasmalai, etc...cupcakes, were ok ok....but they have many many varieties...icing on the cake was live music....i loved the ambience because of that

service 5/5

"here you can have a fine dining experience. the food is top notch and the plating is pleasing. there are a lot of options for ve/non-veg in buffet menu. i order sushi and opted for buffet instead of a-la-carte. if you have an appetite for good taste, this place is a must visit. the ambience is also rich.
p.s. - the sushi is a must try!!!!",5,Positive
"i visited this place for a lunch buffet recently.

they have wide spread of starters, main course, veg- pizza+pasta on table and huge variety of deserts.

food taste was ok, but nothing different.

they have only butter naan and tandoori roti.",3,Neutral
"they have a very good spread in their buffet. the non-veg dishes have a unique flavour and taste which keeps this restaurant different from others, especially the mexican chicken and fish. all the varieties in veg are good. ambience and service is excellent.",4,Positive
"this review has been long overdue, i visited this place for my birthday and gawd i wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all !! the place has this really sophisticated minimal design which isn‚Äôt too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room.
the service is just amazing ! every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out, the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points.
now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant; the food. the food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it mediterranean or italian as a matter of fact even indian.
now i don‚Äôt want to go into detail with all that i ordered and describe it, i‚Äôll attach images with this review and i‚Äôll let the images talk for themselves albeit i‚Äôd like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit- to begin with i‚Äôd like to talk about the pizza, this was one of the finest pizzas i‚Äôve ever had in hyderabad, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned.
moving forward i‚Äôd like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, i‚Äôd have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called mediterranean restaurants. the carbonara was perfectly cooked, in the italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.
to summarize this i‚Äôd say yes this place is a must visit and i‚Äôd definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners, this place is the place to be !!",5,Positive
"amazing food. the way they serve it will make you even happier. great presentation of food. must visit if nearby. also, not that pocket heavy for a fine dine.",4.5,Positive
"ambience- very sophisticated.
food - in terms of variety its great. we had continental. pastas, pizza are to die for. fish and chips were just ok, nothing so great.
desert- cheesecake is a treat.
and frozen alaska was pretty bad. 1 less star only for that.",4,Positive
"i love clean and well lighted restaurants, jonathan's kitchen is certainly one of them soft music, nice and clean seating arrangement appeals you to have a good meal there. i ordered minestrone alla genovese soup, thai green veg curry, agnolotti pasta and chocolate fondant cake. all were delicious and really lives upto your expectations. i expected the chocolate fondant cake to be bit warm, but it wasn't. food is amazing.",5,Positive
got food poison after eating quesadilla yesterday(12/2). had to admit in hospital for a day had to spend 4k inr. will never recommend this to anyone.,1,Very Negative
"went for a sunday brunch with family. the spread is absolutely massive, though veg options were limited, especially starters. however, the food itself is lip smacking good, no matter what we tried. the staff was courteous, and always available to assist. ambience was nice, though the live music was a little too loud, for our liking.",4,Positive
"jonathan's kitchen but jonathan was not there :o

lol

so, i went there for my anniversary lunch. lovely experience.

we went on a working day (of the week) - and that too in lunch hours,

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so, it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience.

the food was good, service was ok (surprisingly!!!), price is also okish
(a bit pricey u can say)
rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were completely free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

anyways, they also brought out an icecream cake at the end for the anniversary celebration, so that was nice.",4,Positive
"has got nice ambience and the food tastes good. they‚Äôve got one of the best pesto pastas in the city. also love the crispy chicken burger, it‚Äôs very tender inside and crispy outside, as said. blueberry cheese cake has not had enough ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù, hope to manage to get a better one next time. very friendly people fo jonathan‚Äôs..",4,Positive
"after two widely separated visits, i'm positively impressed by jonathan's kitchen. both the lunch buffet as well as the a-la-carte dinner were fulfilling experiences in different manners. while the lunch buffet was simply ginormous, with it being impossible to even taste all the dishes, the dinner was apt for a quiet, relaxed evening with some amazing continental food. 4 stars earned.",4,Positive
"this was on my list since few months and finally we went for a sunday buffet.
ambience is good with cool music and performance.
service ok.
food not satisfied.
my review is only on vegetarian food.
starters:
there were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.
live counter:
dosa was ok and gobi paratha was good.
main course:
i couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
all the gravy items were ok.
deserts:
the dishes were mysore pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. when i called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but i couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there. i booked buffet in dineout offer. so, it was good deal for me. in general, i felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive.",3,Neutral

"after having dinner buffet here, really wonder hiw come thia place has this rating. food, service, ambiance...nothing stood out for me. met friends here for dinner and wasn't impressed. food is ok, spread is average. service is good , but thats expected, not exceptional. most disappointing was the setup. very average, considering its a above average priced and a hotel restaurant.
easily avoidable.",3,Neutral

"another immensely satisfying experience at jonathan‚Äôs! if you‚Äôre looking for fine ingredients, a diverse menu, warm and friendly service and most of all a consistent, great taste... you wouldn‚Äôt go wrong picking this place. highly recommend the lamb murtabak and the pizzas and wild mushroom risotto. definitely repeat visitworthy.",5,Positive
"saturday night unlimited buffet with drinks at 1500 .plenty of starter to go with cilantro fish ,chicken,prawns,baby corn,cheese poppers ,pav etc ballentines option in the drink .loved the service and enjoyed the live music .",4,Positive
"this was one of those places on my list that i have been wanting to try for the longest time that i can remember. i specifically wanted to try out the sushi (veg) in this place. i remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. in any case, i ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. the sushi was good but not as good as the one i had tried at mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). the pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic italian restaurants in the city. i also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. in my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. i would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 

all in all, an average place to try out. i might go back to try some of their other items on the menu. 

ambiance: 3/5
food: 3.5/5
service: 2.5/5",3,Neutral

"(vegetarian review on lunch buffet)
pros.....
great service
starter and deserts are the winner here.... satisfied.
spacious and comfortable.
main course is.....i can say not bad.

cons...
asked for nan and we got it when we already finished our lunch.
ice-cream not available. i have asked there but the guy told me there is no ice-cream available. i got to know from my colleague that they serve ice cream on demand. this is wired.

thank you for your service.",4,Positive
"one of the few times when the reviews and the hypes are absolutely off the mark!

went for grill and chill on saturday night... not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....

ambience - it's ok... nothing spectacular... chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...

service - this is the truly sad part. really slow service and servers are uninterested. this really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.

food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... but unfortunately everything was served cold.... you ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...

main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... chicken curry was decent... desserts were ok as well...

overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. barbecue nation does a much better job!

the best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... and plastic spoons for dessert!! pathetic!!!

vfm - rs. 3000 for 3 people... and you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... i'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

not going again!",1,Very Negative
very nice restaurant.. we tripped on italian cuisine and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint you.. staff is very friendly and helpful ..there is a live band playing outdoors.. decent enough.. the place also has a very good selection of burgers,5,Positive
nice restaurant ! good burger but the interiors could be better .. very basic interior !they should upgrade the interior ... otherwise nice food i guess,4,Positive
"a quick dinner for last sunday of 2018 landed us in jonathan's kitchen. we ordered red thai curry with rice for main course and fish soy chilli for starter.
fish soy chilli was spot-on, specially for a wintry night. thai curry was tasty however rice quantity was quite less for the curry accompanying it.
ambience is quite good with oriental decoration",4,Positive
"after hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a sunday.
food - 4/5
ordered pasta alfredo, primavera pizza, butter naan(bad), paneer makhani. all items were good. my family loved them.

ambience - 2.5/5 - beautiful soothing lights. average setup. cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

service - 1/5 - this is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. it's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

will i take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. and no finger bowls :(

will i take my parents? - 3/5 - elderly would like the place and menu options. decent groups around. options in north indian, italian etc are enjoyable for them.

value for money - 3.5/5

washrooms - 2/5.

location - easy to find, valet parking available.

used zomato gold here.",2,Negative
"jonathan's kitchen is there at the ground floor or holiday gift inn express and suites.

ambiance is pretty amazing so is the live music of here. but the food is not as great as you expect from such restaurants.desserts are good and there is also a quite descent range in it.",3,Neutral
"we went here for an afternoon buffet. the place was a little crowded because of an office party. buffet spread is good. the food is tasty. we enjoyed the soup, paneer, veg balls, dhal makani, veg biriyani. dessert has variety and quite good. we enjoyed the food. ala carte seemed to take time. the table next to us was occupied the same time as us but were served when we were on desserts.",4,Positive
"it was on my birthday i visted this place.
ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. right balance of indian, chinese, etc
we ordered a chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :d you won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
tried sushi for the first time.. it was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :d forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. lol..
we ordered 2 mocktails as well which were not there in the menu, suggested by waiter.. both of them tasted good.. :) waiters could have been more attentive other than that no complaints..
overall it was a nice dinner on an occasion of birthday..",5,Positive

"the best place to be if you want to see some sport screening.
what i really liked about the place is they have round about 42 screens and no matter where you sit you will have 5-6 screens which will be clearly visible.
no fight or waiting to get place near to the screen.

we went here during ipl screening.
it was really a great experience.

what we had ordered was ultimate nachos,chicken wings with chipotle sauce and pizza.

everything was really delicious.

portion were quite good for two.

i feel it's bit over priced but worth it..!!

"sooo... it's a sports bar. on the side of a busy road , so easily accessible. very lit... bright.. a bit too bright for my taste though.
i went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. but it was too loud. so the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

food was ok, taste wise. but price was on the higher side. limited variety of food. but they have done some nice experiments with the wings. so , try worthy.

but there are very nice people working there. very friendly, nice staff. service was very good.

along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!

hope to visit again soon.. to a nice ambience üòä",3,Neutral

packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. appreciate the effort.

edit:
orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
it tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! it's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

will keep ordering from amul ! :)",5,Positive

i had this ice cream tooty-fruity. it was so horrible. there were pieces of something that were tasteless and they put so much nuts and other bullshit that the only thing that was okay the actual ice cream i couldn't have the taste of that too. i literally puked the entire thing after having a severe stomach ache. do not have tooty-fruity unless it's just a scoop with no add-ons.,1,Very Negative

"awesome and wonderful place, i had ordered frequently from this place and visited this place a lot times. my top charts for ice-creams were apsara, cream stone and naturals. after getting familiarized with this place this stood top among my top chart.

"the staff was very ill mannered and have no respect towards customers. 6 of us went there to dine in and ordered plenty. one of our friends brought butter milk from the next store and sat along with us. he could have told politely that outside food was not allowed. but he asked him to get out in a mannerless way. we cancelled the order and walked away.

management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. or train their staff properly.

profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality. not the other way around.

i wouldn't suggest a visit to this place if you are not ok with this kind of treatment.",1,Very Negative

amul has an outlet near dlf cybercity gate 2, gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends. this place is small and has less number of tables available. it is decorated with the lights and the loud music plays in the background. people love to enjoy desserts here after having the street food at dlf.
they serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. we ordered belgian chocolate, rajbhog and kesar pista ice creams cost near inr 75. all of them were delicious and mouth watering. service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.

been here on a saturday evening. the service looked a bit slow but the food tasted good. they allow stags without any cover charge but they don‚Äôt let you enter the dance floor if you‚Äôre one. the staff is also very co-operative. go here as a crowd and you would love it.,3,Neutral

i love the interior n decor of the place. it looks quite classy. they can do it bit better though.
there are multiple events going on this place, make it more interesting. the dance floor is big and closed to give u the thumping sound. there is a huge screen for live matches.

food: i have loved the food here be it veg or non veg. fish is quite good. the masala level is decent. liquor collection is good. but i don't find cocktails much interesting here.

value for money: the price is pretty decent compared to the peer pubs. food menu is very reasonable.

"tldr : an avg place with  moderately expensive drinks  ( a lit in pictures at 550  ) a nice club with good ambiance , but they closed the roof top due to less crowd on a saturday night . it was a happening place earlier , which couldn't cope up with new upcoming competition around it . the chicken wings were undercooked . the only good thing about the place was the energetic dj with crazy numbers & the dance floor . the staff were not friendly because they tried to stop me & another blogger from taking pictures & videos of the place multiple times after even mentioning that we were lifetstyle/food bloggers (maybe they might have had a misconception initially ) .",2,Negative

"last night spent at tiki shack for a quick round of drinks. as we reached it started raining giving some respite from the heat and we could enjoy the lovely terrace ambience.

watermelon martini for me and bacardi for my better half with some pork spare ribs was our order. martini was well made to my liking. the ribs had only one rib and rest were chunky pieces which we pointed out. but it was well made in spicy siracha sauce which kind of compensated.

overall a nice place with ample seating though music is on the louder side. the only let down was the plastic cutlery which you wouldn't expect here.",4,Positive
"delicious food and decent crowd! roof top was unbearable because of heat so had to shift inside. since music was bit louder inside, bought some whiskey and went home. overall okayshh.",3,Neutral
everything about this place sound good .. with great ambiance and decent food and drink options .. i would recommend this place only if you are going as a couple or girls .. they have a huge gender discrimination for guys as they need to pay higher cover charges on weekends than the bill they would sum up .. world and tikki shack will be a better place if they stop discriminations and spread equality,2,Negative
party !!!!!!! great place to party and in indira nagar. they have rooftop arrangements and good space to dance and enjoy. very decent and classy crowd. good place to chill at weekend.,4,Positive
a cool place to for casual hangout‚Äôs. do not expect a crowd on weekdays but weekends it‚Äôs good. good food good ambience. service could a little faster but it‚Äôs fine as the music compensates it.,4,Positive

"the place was good, ambiance was very nice! music was amazing!
the issue was with orders, it literally took ages get an order, after lots of struggle! i know, it was crowded and everyone was placing orders but they should also have strength to complete it as they know about the crowd...
wash room must be repaired!",4,Positive
"the desi pub with the beach theme. they have both the indoor and outdoor seating. but they usually provide only the outdoor seating, as they keep their indoor seating mostly reserved. you might reserve and still end up sitting outside. the food was also good. the customer service is something that needs to be improved.
top picks :
chilly prawns
cheesy fries

the chilly prawns is a must try. the mocktails were okay. not much varieties when it comes to mocktails. overall, a great place to hangout.",4,Positive
"ambience and location is nice. but nice to hangouts only in group and a girl is mandatory to be in group. else entry will be denied. thumbs down for stag. starters are good but main course is really horrible. very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking. the staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders. you can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full. the complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority.
you might see lot of positive feedbacks but most of them are done just to get a free ice cream. yes, they offer free ice cream if you write good reviews for them. luckily i don't like vanilla flavour so will write what i felt.",2,Negative

tiki shack was a complete surprise package. when my colleague lead us through the shady stairs and a rumbling lift to tiki shack i wasn‚Äôt expecting much. but to my surprise they had a great menu and the food was amazing. the pizzas were light and tasty and all the starters were quite good. by 10pm the ambience was quite electric and we had a great time.,5,Positive

food was not so great.",4,Positive
"the only thing i liked about this place is there ambience, it was good other than that everything was just average or below average.
the service at this place is pathetic , we had to call the waiters several time for one small thing also .
it was a pub with no dance floor, people had to manage with whatever place they were getting
the place is known for its beach view but as we went on weekday could not see that
food- ofcourse no one should expect anything with the food we get in pubs , it was not good here as well
overall it was not a very good experience at this place",2,Negative
i had been with a friend on a weekday when the place was not much crowded. all we had are pizzas and drinks. the best part is you can customize your pizza. didn't cost us a lot so would say it's reasonable. particularly loved the ambience. we sat in the terrace area which was beautiful. the service is a little slow but we didn't mind waiting.,4,Positive
"tiki shack near jubilee check post was one of my favorites and that's the graar vibe it carries, gachhibowli one is never like that but undoubtedly a good place to hang on. lit will have a special mention in both the places though.
little costly and ya inside they would have some restrictions with stags and couple
your wallet would feel happy if you are going as couple or gang",3,Neutral

"this one is bigger than the jubilee hills one and surely got good space which is a great thing as the previous one gets so cringy. we went on a ladies night but the sad part it goes only from 8 to 10 p.m. and most of the girls where not even there, anyway the starters are quite price competitive and tasty. we had veg spring rolls, veg manchurian and chicken balls. all were great and i have ordered long island iced tea which they made perfect.

on wednesdays they have a guest dj maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house dj akso is great too.

all the best guys.....keep rocking üëç

"looking for a place filled with crazy people with affordable drinks and upbeat music? tiki shack is the place for you. located on roof top in indra nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded gachibowlli and hi-tech city. the place is dimly lit, but i guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. the dj plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. the staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. the food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. i have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed. go in with your friends on a weekend for an affordable menu and feet tapping music.
keep up the good work tiki shack",5,Positive

"visited the gachibowli branch of tiki shak on a sunday evening.
the place is very well placed in a very accessible area of gachibowli.
it's a rooftop bar, hence the ambience was pretty amazing. they have nicely set up indoor and outdoor seating areas.

we ordered :

jalapeno cheese poppers - 4/5 - yummy cheese filled balls with right amount of spices and jalapenos.

aloo pakode - 3.5/5 - pretty normal with a homely taste to it

overall it was a good experience. the place also offers 2+2 on drinks which can also be used on mocktails ( just in case you are not a fan of alcohol ).",4,Positive

"we visited the place on thursday night after calling up to do the booking for 3 stag entry. we got the response over the phone that we can just walk in at 7pm. as soon as i entered the first response from a person (nikhil) at the front desk was ""stag not allowed"". when i showed my phone and explained that i did call to do the booking, he said no. i was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. it was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. if you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. don't change your rules according to your convenience. grow up !!!!!",1,Very Negative

shit-fit ‚Äì so happy its thursday cuz friday is tomorrow..!!

while we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out, i would like to share my recent experience with tiki shack - rooftop bar, gachibowli where i have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning .. such a pulsating d√©cor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. this place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). unlike many places around gachibowli, tikki shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000inr including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. no separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.

we negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). the menu includes unlimited 3 veg and non-veg starters, 1 veg and non-veg pizza, 1 veg and non-veg biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). with least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. full house and the service was still attentive needs a special mention.

overall a satisfactory experience and i would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.

kindly bare with the poor photography.

"we came for just a couple of beers, j√§ger and baileys. ordered for 8 baileys shots first and they tasted funny for some reason and when we asked for more after clarifying about the taste, they mentioned that it‚Äôs out of stock it so happens that j√§ger, glenfidditch is out of stock too.

food was up to the mark.",2,Negative
"i have been to this place twice. my first experience wasn't that great as i found the food items to be sub-par. so i quickly went to a different place. after 2 months i recently went again for an office party with ~40 people and it turned out to be a better experience. starters [chilli chicken, fries, cheese poppers, some fish] were fine but nothing extra-ordinary, ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here & there, dj was average, biryani was good i heard but did not try it myself. pizza was a big let down both in taste & presentation, it was served cut into small rectangular pieces. service was decent. staff courteous. good interiors.
overall - 3.5 considering the prices. recommended for group drinking sessions, maybe a bit of dancing too.",4,Positive
no dance floor and dj was not such good . need to improve dj system and good players to be placed and no stock in alcohol what ever we wish to oder sorry not available.,3,Neutral
we celebrated the a friends bday and it was good. the dj was average at that time which was a little mood killing. but the food and drinks are good. the bday boy almost passed out as we gifted him the helmet pop. after which i dont think he remembers the next 24 hours!,4,Positive
"spent an amazing saturday night there.
great service.
ambience is really good.
and food is okayish but the vibe makes up for it.
would definitely recommend",4,Positive
the staff aren‚Äôt well trained they are non responsive had to wait for them to take the order even though there were only few table occupied and the food is also not worth.. the cutlery aren‚Äôt cleaned they had stains all over and felt like was at a local bar .,2,Negative
"i've been coming to this branch on a weekly basis. off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever i ask for the beer of my choice(kf ultra or kf draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. once, i've asked karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. i've visited this place today i.e. wednesday and it's the same story, again! i'm forced to order heineken or bira. the worst part was when i was about to push off after our hangout, i've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of draught beer and when i've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. like really? speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and i'm really disappointed this time. well, what can i say, mustang is much better-they offer everything in the menu. i never expected that i'd drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in hyd, but i really can't help it this time. work this out asap.",1,Very Negative
"love the terrace sitting area. the music and crowd is amaze and the ambience is lit. even the non-dancers will groove here! the food quality, quantity and taste everything is good. the paneer pakora is the best ever i have tasted. french fries are crispy from outside and soft from inside, again one of the best. chilli cheese toast was good.",5,Positive

i visited this place 2 days back with my frens hoping to have good time.. even though ambience and music was decent... the service is extremely poor... waiters are rude and behave as if they are doing some favor to u... manager was also not helpful... its high high time they improve their services if they want their customers to come back to them...,1,Very Negative
"i visited tiki shack on a weekend afternoon and unexpectedly there was hardly any crowd. only three tables were occupied. then realized this place is so good but happening only in the evening. oh btw, those instagram famous 'tiki shack roof lights' are lit only in the evening, so yes, the place, i'm sure looks much better and beautiful in the evenings.  the food served here was too good. we've ordered mostly finger food and everything we ordered tasted exceptionally good.",4,Positive
hi.. really disappointed with the service and staff was rude and not attentive at all.. seemed like all waiters were already high and had no clue wats going arnd them... manager was also not very helpful.. but cant blame him with the dumb team.. u cant do much... ambience is decent but the service is really really poor...,1,Very Negative

"my friends and i went here on a friday night around 8:30 and the place was pretty full and had good music interesting interiors  and overall great vibe.
the service was a little slow, but quite understandable given the crowd that kept pouring in till late in the night

food that we ordered - 
1. masala peeenat  - your normal peanuts with onions tomatoes and some spices. decent munching

2. masala lijjat - this is masala papad with the same toppings as above, so we didn't quite enjoy it that much

3. bhej manchurian - veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. jalapeno cheese poppers - unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. also, good accompanying dip

5. aloo pakode - aloo bhajiyas! loved them! :d

6.  fries - good old classic salted fries! :)

the dj played some really great songs! 
had a great time, especially when they played the bollywood music and most people were on their feet!",3,Neutral
"food is good, especially the taste, but range is limited for main course. they have a good dance area though not marked out and hinders the movement. outside seating is decent and service is better.",4,Positive
"i will not recommend this place at all....i visited this place today with 7 friends
we were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
after 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

i was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that i recommended this place

after 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table we started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..when i complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where i can accommodate my 7 friends

now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

many thanks for spoiling our friday night",1,Very Negative

"very bad behaviour of the staff, no one took the order for 45 minutes, when we asked the staff they were pointing at each other saying he will take order. when we called the manager he was unnecessarily defending the staff saying they thought that table is for 4 other people must be joining. sheer waste of time.",1,Very Negative
nice place for party. good ambiance. outside sitting is nice. we went on wednesday for ladies night and had a great time. tasty food.friendly staff and great service.,5,Positive
"the quality of food and drink was really good. what turned out to be the biggest let-down was the service. a few of the waiters are really ignorant. they look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only. with much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order. after waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. we got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined. so my humble request is, if you don't like to serve a smaller group, mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant.",3,Neutral
loved the service as well as the food. especially the chicken salt and pepper. loved it so much that i took 2 portions home as parcel. the staff is also friendly. must visit place.,5,Positive
"amazing indoor and outdoor place to chill. music is amazing... go for safe choice of food selection, which you are aware of... i visit here all the time for music! cool crowd. gotta improve over food and cocktails! drinks otherwise is good (options)! two stars less coz they gotta improve over food!",3,Neutral

"not that much great place, reason being the service is very slow. no one comes to take the order. located in a great business area with all the big companies. the place has energy and good vibe but service is something that needs to be worked on. they have started serving different vapes at this place which costs around 700-800/-. thats something cool you get in different flavours. food is fine.

if you‚Äôre a person who would start off your clubbing night with some pop, electronic music and end it with proper punjabi dhol then this is the place for you.
amazing dj! he knew when to get the crowd exited.
i‚Äôve tried their long island iced tea and johnny walker.
lit was amazing.. one of the best i‚Äôve had in the city.
their chilly prawns was also yummy (not spicy enough for a hyderabadi though)
also, you get to try vape here! (try their blueberry flavour, it‚Äôs dope)

"visited this place on a saturday evening cause i've heard a lot about tiki shack. the ambience was pretty decent and has a beautiful roof top view. but, i was honestly surprised that the food wasn't that great and infact i thought it was bad enough for all that i've heard from people.

ordered non veg nachos and i hardly found any non veg in it. the pizza was quite bland too. one of the really bad pepporoni pizza i've had in my life.

food: 3/5. (3 cause of service and the nice people there)",3,Neutral

do carry your id cards with a visible photo, mindfully!",4,Positive
"i could rate below one..where i didn't satisfy on billing part..i didn't know how they are collecting customer money , for me it's very disheartening on bill amount they are taking 7% optional service charges..my bill amount was around 2k means 126..they are removed when i was asked to them..it's not fair ..it's another type of integrity in business .",1,Very Negative

a super-hit club of jubilee hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

standard cocktails can be made better. in food, nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

music is good and sometimes they bring in dhol wala to up the spirit

best pub in gachibowli. budget friendly. u can get good experience here. visited many times and never got disappointed. their snacks menu is also so different. courteous staff. nice dj.,5,Positive

"service was too slow. waiters took some 20 minutes to realise we wanted to place an order.
music was excessively loud, and reached a point where the speakers couldn't support the playback without distorting the music.

i didn't like food either",2,Negative
"tiki shak, gachibowli - hyderabad

the gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks, chit chat and dance with my group.

the place is only and solely for party animals, completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. they have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables.

the best time to go here is on friday night after work, or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy, plus there's live music by a dj, live entertainment and wifi. so,dance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours' feet.

among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas, regular margaritas, beer to desi and angrezi whiskey. if you want to try something different after work, then do try their helmet pop (for inr 980 - which is an experience in itself). this involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp.

for food, try their chilli cheese toast, finger chips, chilli chicken, masala peanuts and spring rolls. the prices are really pocket friendly.

we had ordered 3 non veg starters and 3 veg starters. there weren‚Äôt many good options for veg starters and something veg that we ordered were just average at taste. and moreover that day there were only starters and main course was not available. when it comes to music this was the best part. the day we visited there was bhangra music. apart form bhangra the dj was good was playing mostly bollywood music. overall if you want good bollywood music with not so great food you can surely try this place",3,Neutral

my friends had sex on the beach cocktail and i had virgin mojito mocktail and i must say, both of them were amazing. i had the mint cooler too and i liked virgin mojito better. definitely worth a try.

"food, drinks and music all is good. what this place lacks is in service. the servers literally forgot us and we had to call them multiple times and remind them to take our orders. the ambience is great. the view is superb. they have 3 sitting areas, indoor and two terrace sitting.",3,Neutral
"one of the better and smaller roof top places in hyderabad. it would hardly have about 8 tables on the rooftop which makes me like this place. it's quite, cosy and they play some good music. there are also 2 exclusive places on the rooftop, one which is like one tiny table on an elevation and another like an enclosed area.

we asked for cheese balls, fish tava, chicken 65 and margarita pizza. all these items were good, nothing exceptional but just about right. recommend- yes, must visit- maybe not",4,Positive
"horrible service, food is below average. staff is extremely rude including the manager. ambience is the only good thing. if i had an option i would have given a negative star rating. this place just spoilt my friday night mood.",1,Very Negative
"already been to this place twice, absolutely love the rooftop and the food. it's really windy up there and has a great ambiance, would highly recommend for a date or for hanging out with friends.
the only problem is the service is pretty slow which is probably because there isn't enough staff.
otherwise no complaints at all.",4,Positive

"the place i have visited many times made me sad by the last visit. because most of the tables they kept on reserved, though during staying there till 10.30pm, we have not seen anyone to come and occupy the seats. the starters items are extremely costly and very less in quantity. only reason of visiting the place is roof top. otherwise it is one of the most expensive places to visit in gachibowli area.",3,Neutral

we ordered cheese balls, chicken wings, chicken manchurian, chilli paneer and bbq pizza! the pizza wasn't great but everything else was delicious!
the staff is friendly and though they were a little confused with our order for 'flavoured shots' they were very patient and bought us exactly what we are desired for and treated us really well üíì

"really bad experience.
for the first time i heard we do not provide glasses to serve water.

even worse, for the first the i heard that we serve quarter plate/dinner plate only once on a table and even if it gets spoiled they won't change.

and worst of all, when you try to talk to manager he is not even interested and asks us to leave the table if we are not liking the experience.

would not like to recommend any of my friends to visit the place.",1,Very Negative
the place refused to replace quarter plate. the service is pathetic. food is on table but no spoons or forks. the manager has one answer they are playing by rule book,1,Very Negative
"it's a good place with awesome ambience and a wide variety of dishes to choose from. we booked a terrace lounge for our team out and have spent good time. the staff are courteous and the service is faster than expected. would love to go again here. pros: ambience, food, alcohol, service.",4,Positive
"though it was my 4th time visit to this place, but honestly i enjoyed much on weekday party rather than on weekends. me and my friend are throwing a party for our colleagues. i observed on weekends it‚Äôs always overcrowded here and won‚Äôt get seats for group 5 ppl or above, may be due to dance floor.

this time we got a nice staff, who served us very well with his prompt services. apart from our drinks, we enjoyed rawa fish sticks and delicious pizzas here.

"rooftop bar with perfect ambience for a peaceful time. you'll definitely like the view from the top.

food was decent with satisfactory service. music was loud enough to set your mood. they do have a small dance floor. perfect tiny place!!! definitely worthy of frequent visits üòäüòâ.",5,Positive
"awesome rooftop place to hangout. dance floor and dj are cool. service is ‚Äúthe best‚Äù. the way they welcome you, take care of your order is just extraordinary. yes, i am a regular here and almost made friends ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. if you are looking for a crazy dance party, you can have an inside table and if you are on a date rooftop is your place. the location attracts the best crowd in the town. visit on a saturday and thank me later üëçüèº",5,Positive
"been here twice. i just love the ambience here.
open roof top view at nights is something one shouldn't miss.
service could be better. (probably because we went on a friday night. happening place it is.)
food too wasn't top notch.
they do have a dance floor. (but not big enough)
overall it's a fun place to hangout with friends.",4,Positive
"with an impressive location, it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative. the ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room. the sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base. 

the food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere.

the outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain.

it is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more",3,Neutral
"boy oh boy , the prepossessing set up of rooftop.. the ambience. the beautiful music.. the feeling.. yes, the feeling we got, in this place ..!!

so we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. mustang was on the way and we stopped there. since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. and even the music was not too loud.
addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... no 'nadi ka keenara'üò£, but there was 'chanchal hawa' üò¨

too dramatic??- i know ü§£
anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but i think it was wallbanger. and it will get you to bang the wall. üòú didn't have food, so can't comment. but from other tables, it was smelling delicious. a bit heavy on the pockets. but for the view it provides, worth it.

so, if it's all so good, y one star less? here goes the answer. all was well until we were about to head out and i decided to go to the little girls room. and guess what..!! i got locked from outside üò≠. though, after i knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever i spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that i was locked.

message for the management: please have at least one staff in the restrooms, till you shut down, to avoid these kind of issues. plzzzz.. üò•",4,Positive
"good place to hangout and chill, the terrace seating is also good, ambiance is ok, we booked a table via @dineout_india, rather than drinks, the food is good here
and in frame1 the spicy chicken table-- which was not that spicy but it tastes excellent, and the pizza we ordered was chicken keema pizza-- which also good with thin crest, cheese was also good mustang terrace lounge
the only disappointment is drinks",4,Positive

"mustang terrace lounge
this restaurant and bar is perfect for casual dine in on weekdays and best for friday night, they have a cozy interior seating and the outside seating gives the best view of the city, the menu includes the best snacks to have with drinks such as malai kebabs, tawa machhi, dahi kebabs, stuffed mushroom and many more.
the restaurant has a wide variety of mexican and italian cuisine dishes such as enchiladas, quesadillas, burgers, pizzas and pastas.

this is a must visit rooftop place in hyderabad.",4,Positive
"i happen to visit mustang yesterday with my family and friend and i regret why i chose it at first place.

the service there is pathetic. you order any thing ( even a beer ) it takes them 20-25 min.

even after repeatedly telling them, looked like they were drunk or deaf. considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the veg and non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the roti's to come.

the manager pavan, i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement. he had just one answer sorry, rather then managing the staff and taking to them, he was taking the walk in the park.

one star that too just of the ambiance and roof top.",1,Very Negative
loved the place it's very attractive. it has the best view from top. service is good and enjoyed the tasty food as they customized in the way i want. minor drawback found with the parking,4,Positive

"what can i say about this place. i used to stay in gachibowli and used to visit the place often. it's a happening place during weekends, not so much during weekdays, but i have never seen it overcrowded (which is why i love it so much). one negative i would say is that the price are a bit higher than their competition.",4,Positive

"not worth it at all. paid 500‚Çπ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

went here last night, got a table for 3.
the service was extremely poor and slow .
the waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
he was the only one around .. wearing a csk t shirt.

when the starters started arriving i was shocked
the starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. un bearable.
for a person who has stayed in hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how hyderabadi food tastes.

mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
fish wasn't cooked
chicken was toooo spicy
crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
potato cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

panner didn't arrive at all

water arrived

left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

settled for curd rice

icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
icecream was good but the gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

when i was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. i had a bite .. it was ok

but i had enough already

everyone around my table were complaining too..
but no use ..
useless place
never again",2,Negative

i would not recommend you to eat but if you just want to have a bite of taste then go ahead. :)",2,Negative

the fact that it is not fresh offsets a lot of the positives for me",2,Negative

no taste and no quality. i wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of hyderabad

increase the quality food then no matter what the price is .",1,Very Negative

ordered veg biryani from the restaurant as suddenly i was craving for veg. i was so impressed by the packing & also they give raita & gulab jamun with it.

the biryani was properly packed. and was warm enough to eat too. it had a really good taste that other places with veg biryani don't. it's really different. and its very tasty.
one can definitely try their veg biryani.

( all vegetarians & biryani lovers this is for you)

do try it out.",4,Positive

ordered the much hyped about behrouz biriyani today.wanted to have it since ages.so today when the package came i was really thrilled.the biriyani comes in a stunning package.and as you open it the room fills with amazing biriyani smells.the biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top.the biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too.the biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in hyderabad.this one is extremely sutle in taste.the chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily. the rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked.overall the biriyani was a really good experience.but i personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way.,3,Neutral
bad service i have not received the order but i got a mail that you have enjoyed the meal. irritating service from zomato . not support team and pick up delivery boy called for delivery,1,Very Negative

"well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore hyderabadi and a true foodie.. i understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here's my review, behrouz is not a hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it's biryani not being local.

i might not like it to the core as an hyderabadi but as a food critique i don't have any complaints.. it's unique in it's preparation, was absolutely mild, ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces, the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters, was aromatic and we'll garnished with dry fruits.

felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and mandi, now this review even holds strong backing as i had a irani friend who liked it as well.

really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert. the gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end, did regret eating it..and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved.

overall -
taste : 3.5/5
price : 3.5/5
packaging : 4/5

"the only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me. sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings. coz the dish looks pretty but..... similarly, the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich. but at the end wasn't satisfying.",3,Neutral

nothing changed but got an add on ‚Äúthe black box‚Äù which has a chocolate lava cake which was the only thing good. the package was good like before and as expected. nothing to say about that biryani because i didn‚Äôt taste it. on an assumetion the biryani was with good mutton peices and didnt look that spicy and had almond pieces over. need to improve alot with the service and also taking the taste into consideration for a hyderabadi.",2,Negative

a bit pricey though. i will definitely try the mutton biryani next time!",4,Positive

it definitely breaks the traditional concept of a ‚Äòbiryani‚Äô. i personally felt, that though it is super delicious, it should be named pulao not biryani. last but not the least absolutely great at taste and worth the try.",4,Positive

"heard lots of times about this royal biryani.... finally placed order for murgh makhani biryani.
firstly, packaging was good, seemed like a gift box with cutlery and mouth freshener. then, coming to biryani, aroma was pleasant and circulated over the entire room within no time. chicken pieces were well cooked and melted in the mouth. biryani tasted sweet, even with lots of masala, unlike the other conventional hyderabadi spicy ones. two add-on options available, mirchi salan and mint raitha to order as required. quantity and quality of rice is good.

summing it up, behrouz royal biryani is definitely worth a try, if you got bored of eating spicy hyderabadi biryani's.",4,Positive
"heard lot about behrouz biryani. so, i ordered dum ghost biryani. packaging was impressive & quantity also pretty decent, and about taste my only suggestion is keora water or gulab jal whatever you've used will help to enhance the aroma of the food not the taste. you guys have to work on flavour rather than adding too much aroma.",2,Negative

"i had ordered lazeez bhuna murgh biriyani from behrouz biriyani. the packaging really impressed me, because in case of biriyani when it is present in a bowl, it is tough to eat it directly from that, but behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box, with the necessary cutleries attached, and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out. then about the taste of the biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. so it was basically a sweet biriyani. the chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. mint raita was also impressive. if you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this biriyani. i would love to try out other biriyanis from behrouz later some time :)",4,Positive

i ordered a shawarma and i received a rotten shawarma. i don't understand why people do this. it's food. not any product. if you want to increase the price. do it. but how can you serve this type of food to anyone. this is completely rotten and even smells very bad. would never order from you again.,1,Very Negative
"fried maggie's are better compared with the normal one, normal maggie's are prepared like soup with more water also sometimes they let the maggie to burn and add water in it ,that would be horrible. good to go as a midnight snack.",3,Neutral

"it's a very small food joint like a pan shop and very crowded since there are many other food joints in the same lane.
it's nothing exceptional but if you really love maggi then you can give it a try.
we tried fried chicken maggi but are doubtful of it being halal üòê
if anyone knows about it, please let me know.",3,Neutral
"its a small joint located near the dlf it park. well who doesnt love maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet. you can either visit the place or even place order online. i have tried both methods with varying experience. 
i visited the outlet and maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. so one thing probably with maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

double egg chicken maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
double masala chicken maggi - definitely worth a try 
chicken fried maggi is my personal favorite

i was wanting to order from here once for that taste of maggi. who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? so one fine night, ordered for a corn masala cheese butter maggi through zomato.  that was the most fanciest name i could find on their menu. 

the delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. the maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which i am not that big a fan of. it could have been a bit drier. but the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.  good cost effective outlet for the love of maggi noodles.",3,Neutral

*i strongly discourage families with kids from visiting this place*

*writing this review within 10 hours of visiting this place*

wish i could give a negative rating. this place is ridiculously lazy. no this review is not about food, cost or ambience. this is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). we order veg biriyani, two rotis and kadai paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. my two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said i will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

the last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. so no loss in letting us leave.

the sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. i can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. but with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it). and in this time and age of digital pervasiveness, beign careless about it is inviting trouble.",1,Very Negative

"all star to the food, service and ambience... we were looking for a good banquet or restaurant in gachibowli area to celebrate our 10th marriage anniversary. as the moment was special we were looking for a place where we can enjoy the time with family and friends. searched almost 5-6 locations but bottomed down to pot pourri. were little concerened if made the right choice...but voila.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:
1.quality of food - we have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for north indian taste in food. the instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... food was great...i got lot of enquires from guests that how did i locate this place... very very satisfied... must taste from my side- bengal fish curry and nizami handi..

the starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... awsome..

2. service- the staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. it was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... 

3. ambience- the restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... as we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff...

"we visited this restaurant recently. we have ordered potpourri royyala vepudu, gongura mamsam ( not there in the menu, they have made it on our request ) and plain rice.

potpourri royyala vepudu: a south indian style prawn ( medium sized ) starter (dry). this dish had at least 15-20 prawns. the prawns were coated and cooked in spices. the prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty.

gongura mamsam: small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy. we found this dish too sour ( i guess they have added tamarind too ) compared to our previous experience with gongura based gravy.

overall experience was nice. the service was good.",3,Neutral

"had been here to taste authentic andhra/telangana cuisine. 
tried the cashew chicken starter and the prawn biriyani. 

the starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it. it looked like some home made beginner dish. it was really dry. the server even forgot to give me chutney with it. 

the only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level. it was above normal levels. otherwise no special flavour. the dish didnt have enough salt , which we added later, ourself. 
there was some birthday party going on, because of which each dish took an hour to get to us. 

after all this hassle, they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid. 

i am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and i was just at the wrong place.",2,Negative
"*writing this review as soon as i got out of the restaurant*
from the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. left right after starters. i wouldn't even care to rate it one star. one of worst restaurants to dine-in. i think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more theüí∞üí∞üí∞
after reaching at 2 pm there was no receptionist. after the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. it was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. that's it. a piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. neither proper ac chambers nor proper cooling. it was hot. thanks pot pourri for understanding and making our dining uncomfortableüòí. after we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. by this time i was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, i just realised that it was true.
after soup and buttermilk starters were served painfully slow. it took more than an hour for them to finish serving just 6 starters. were they kidding me?? they wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. if you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. we had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(i guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. i'll just get that served for you"". we don't want no sorry. you can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. after seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". i decided to leave the restaurant. after all this he had the audacity to charge us the complete bill. it was 1100. it wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. after arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we hadüòí. wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
starters: i found the starters to be normal good in quality. not very impressive nor was menu standing out. if you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. soup: we were served chicken soup. it wasn't impressive. it was fine.
2. buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. chicken tikka: it was ok. it was hard, sometimes soft.
4. ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. i mean it felt like typical indian curry. it was just good.
6. fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. probably this is the only best thing there.
8. crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
main course: i found it to be typically common. nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
desserts: not much varieties. what's there is menu is served.
ambience: i don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested.",1,Very Negative

"i went there last sunday. had a buffet. honestly i didn't like the food taste and quality of vegetable and specially non-veg items. it tasted stale. no doubt service is good , staff is always smiling. but they need to improve a lot on food quality. even the biryani was not up to the mark. moreover the chicken was undercooked or old, our stomach felt funny when we reached home.",3,Neutral
i've been here for lunch. the place has a very good ambience. staff were polite. food needs a special mention here. we've ordered cashew pulav (south indian style) and kadai panner. both the items are at their best in taste. kadai panner is purely love. will definitely suggest this place. hope to visit here soon again.,4,Positive

"so i met my brother here for lunch yesterday.

we ordered spring rolls, kaju paneer curry and butter naans.

the best amongst the order was the starter. the curry was just okay, with strong turmeric after taste.

the breads we ordered also arrived cold which made them difficult to chew.

overall, just an average experience. would have enjoyed if the naans were better and the curry didn't have so much turmeric in it.",3,Neutral
"went here for a team lunch party a while back and i swear to god the food was pathetic. the starters they server were cold and even after calling out the waiter multiple times there wasn't a positive response.
when we called the manager, there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty.
the ambience is good though. if only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating.
all we ate that day was curd rice üòë the entire team.
i wish you guys could improve and we would try here again.",1,Very Negative

"pot pourri is one of the budget friendly restaurants in gachibowli, indira nagar, where we can find telugu cuisine menu along with north indian and chinese one's. ambience was good. corporate team lunches and dinners make this place crowdy.

we have ordered starter as pot pourri chepa and special chicken biryani boneless. welcome drink watermelon juice was served. pot pourri chepa is a must try, loaded with spices and sauces. fish was too soft inside and crispy outside just like we desired it to be. special chicken biryani boneless was not in the menu, but was made and served. it tasted good as well.

service was nice, staff frequently asked for taste of dishes and any spice level changes if required. it was really a good try with zomato gold ,as special chicken biryani was complimentary. paid only for starter. thanks zomato !",4,Positive
service was horrible. waiters dint even feel like taking the order....(the resturant was not busy also for giving that as an excuse) resturant has very poor service,1,Very Negative

didnt go gaga about it nor did i not like it, will try again perhaps this time in the restaurant.",3,Neutral
i have been to this place for my team lunch on 22nd feb. we opted for buffet. just to serve the soup they took 20 mins and starters for another 15 mins. apparently they didn‚Äôt serve the soup to all my team members and when we tried talking to the manager he was not available neither the servers. they hardly have any options available for veg or non-veg. food taste is not great and whole service is pathetic. what we thought will be a memorable time resulted in frustration for choosing this place. not going again neither recommend.,1,Very Negative
"food is not good , we all came here for team lunch in starter we only got 4 item but the taste of the starter is not good. so this place is not good for veg and non veg lover lovers. in sweets we have two ice cream flavours and rasgulla and kaddu ka kheer etc who will eat kaddu ka kheer",2,Negative

but the food tasted pretty good.
we ordered few rotis with veg kofta curry
and chilly garlic fried rice.

the ambience is pretty simple, it's one large seating area with different tables.

service is a bit slow, but the best part is they make sure you are attended for and take down the order as you asked for.
i went here for dinner today to celebrate my parents anniversary. my mother is never satisfied easily when it comes to food and picky, she said she liked the food. that was a huge shocker to me.
both veg and non-veg are good.
we ordered kheema pulav(to cover the taste buds of spice), andhra chicken tikka, veg manchuria(omg awesome it was), veg sheek kabab, kadai paneer (tastier) and butter naans..

i visited this place last friday with my friends and we had ala carte. i don‚Äôt want to give any rating the service was very poor and slow there main focus was people having buffet. after waiting for 25 mins and lot of reminders we got our food. when the bill came they have added additional items which we didn‚Äôt had cost around 600 to the bill and my friends bad she didn‚Äôt checked the bill that time. so after this horrible experience i will suggest not to visit and id you are visting and having ala carte please cross check the bill before paying otherwise you can be the next victims of this thugs restaurant.,1,Very Negative

"living in manikonda, this has been our go-to place for good mughlai food. if you want authentic hyderabadi biryani, then this should be a default option. 

have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. 

the chicken biryani is their specialility. large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. the quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.

we tried their haleem too in this ramzan and it was delicious. creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which i really prefer in my haleem. 

avoid going for a dine-in given the crowd but for home delivery, this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed.

food - 5/5
value for money - 4/5
packaging - 4/5",4,Positive
"this place was recommended by people for some good haleem, and that's the reason we paid this place a visit. we ordered two dishes of haleem and two full plates and one regular plate of chicken biryani.

the haleem was very well prepared and had the aroma and taste. it was delicious! the servings of biryani was overwhelming and very filling. the regular serving was more than one normal person could eat. but the taste was average and nothing new. the chicken was cooked well.

the ambience was good but a little too full. there's no default seating for groups of more than four people, and as we were a group of five, we had to rearrange a few chairs. the service was prompt but, understandably, very busy.",4,Positive
"midnight craving.if you are in hyderabad & that too in the month of ramzan, then haleem is a must try.it has a very rich & aromatic taste which is more than enough for 2 people.",4,Positive
please include vegetable haleem in menu to order as it is only available in pista house. we can say the best vegatable haleem is available here and served hot.,3,Neutral
"the best haleem in the city, mouth watering tummy satisfying dish... eid is not fullfilled without eating this haleem... i am very happy to suggest pista house to the food lovers in the city who have not yet tried",5,Positive
"""haleem haleem haleem""

hello peeps;
people around us say pista house , pista house during ramzan just because they prepare haleem well.

i was literally waiting for a free time to go & have haleem .
then seeing the very big queue outside the pista house i decided to go home & order.

i ordered mutton haleem , naan & paneer butter masala.
naan & paneer butter masala were mouth watering to look at & even tasted soooo good!!!

haleem wasn't that excellent. it was ok ok because they added a lotss of spices like black pepper & cloves.

üëâüëâit's irritating when you chew haleem & get lots of cloves in between when you chew ( i hope you understood, lol)

paneer butter masala : quantity was sufficient for 5 naans. i would rate 5 for the taste. but i would rate this restaurant upon haleem only.

haleem taste : as i said , not as expected. it was just ok. cloves spoiled my cup of haleem.

i will still give it a try in other branches of pista house & will let you know the reviews.",3,Neutral
tried ‚Äòpathar ka ghost‚Äô and loved it. this place is famous for haleem which i am yet to try. tried a couple of chinese items as well and loved them. all-in-all a very reputed and reliable place to dine-in,4,Positive

"if there could be an option of zero stars, i would definitely put it. it's a very bad experience ordering from pista house. the food is good, but service is very slow, pathetic and bad. the managers and people managing speak blatant lies over calls for a order on swiggy.
they constantly make the delivery guy wait with false words to both the customers and the delivery partner.
if running a hotel business is so difficult, maybe a change in management would help. completely ruining the name and brand of pista house.",1,Very Negative

"disappointment..being one of the famous restaurant chain, had lot of expectations.we were made to seat on table with dirty table mats and plates.. food quality is worst to the core. ordered mutton rogan josh which had excess amount of salt, to our suprise staff was least bothered to act on it or accept feedback. didn't have biryanis available hence had to sacrifice with steamed rice and dal.
would not recommend this restaurant as needs huge improvement in terms of food quality, service and hygiene standards",1,Very Negative

"went there for lunch with friends, and not a good dining experience.
1.  ambience - not like a fine dine restaurant - more a quick eatery / cafeteria place
2.  service  : ok.  the person who took the order did promptly mention how much time a dish will take to be served, it is good to be prepared
3.  food : ok to pathetic.  we had some starters paneer tikka was good and other ones were ok and from my friends who had tandoori prawns their opinion was not so good.  after the starters the disaster came in the name of egg biriyani.  we had ordered for 2 egg biriyani,  there was no flavour, gravy or taste in that, it is just a coloured biriyani rice with fried boiled eggs. see the photo.  it didnt end here, we gave a feedback the waiter promptly took the bowl back to get some masala in it, and came back and served with masala which was chicken pieces. two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.  

we ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful, we were charged for that biriyani, after some discussion they reduced the  price of 1 biriyani from our bill.

overall not a good experience and dont want to go there again.",2,Negative

"went for a team lunch. the place is opposite care hospital.

ambiance

this place has normal ambiance as all the other irani hotels. the problem is that there are a lot of swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. we felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.

food quality

we ordered three items

1. devils chicken
: chewy chicken coated. this was the best dish of the lot

2. tandoori chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3. premium biryani: this was really bad. when people go to a irani style hotel, there are some expectations. we like biriyani dum cooked. this particular biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. the rice was passable and the biriyani was fully mixed..... not the layering like it is supposed to be. it textured like a pulao with the masala . the chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... you can tell that is was stale. the chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.

this looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.

biryani and food items in traditional hotels like paradise, shah ghouse, mehfil, shahdab, bawarchi are really good. the tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

the service took a long time in coming. it looks like they are short of staff. people will go there by the name and feel bad. i feel the pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues. this outlet is making a fast buck in the hitech area where floating population is heavy.",1,Very Negative
"ordered 1 zafrani chicken biryani and 1 malai kebabs. both the items were very good. quantity was enough for 3 people , delivery was quick. bottom line is we had a simple and lovely lunch. thanks !üëç",4,Positive

now come to the service - we ordered 3 butter chicken but they gave us 1, so had to wait for another 15-20mins to get the other butter chicken (please do not compare the taste of butter chicken if youre from north india)

"a very famous place in hyderabad which previously used to sell only haleem but now it sells a hell lot of thing and the best part is that they sell a delicacy that is special biriyani which consists of mutton, chicken, fish and yes it will be tough for even 3 people to complete it...

"good food with reasonable prices-
ambiance-
pista house has a long chain of restaurants in hyderabad. this outlet is located in gachibowli near south india shopping mall. pista house is bakery and restaurant having a large number of take away products available. ambiance is quite congested because they have restaurant in the central area of hall surrounded by bakery. also they have separate party hall available for advanced reservation.
food-
pista house is mostly famous for it's bakery products. also in time of ramzan, they serve haleem. pista house serves indian as well as continental food including chinese, italian. we ordered chicken burger served with potato chips and ketchup, garlic bread, chicken tangdi kebab, angara kebab and chicken biryani. both the kebabs were good in taste and quantity. all other food items were very good in taste including chicken biryani. they serve zafrani chicken biryani.

"happy to have pista house set up a branch in cyberabad, the choice of food here is fantastic with a wide array of desserts,snacks and shakes for people to order.
i personally love their salads(chicken, tuna) as they are done with fresh ingredients and served well.
they need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they don't taste the way they look, the taste is bland for the shakes.
another important concern is the pricing the price of items is different at different outlets, the same stuff at tolichowki is cheaper compared to the gachibowli branch.",3,Neutral
"one of the best achari mutton. soft and properly marinated meat. the spices were properly grinded and cooked. the aroma of the food was so mesmerising that after a point we forgot to click the pics. zafrani mutton biryani here is a must for all the connoisseurs of good food. while other biryani joints also pretty good, but pista house has a distinct place in hyderabadi food map. the sitafal sweet suggest by our captain was awesome. staff was good especially shahrukh with his distinct serving style. also bone soup is a must try.",5,Positive

"apart from its good quality haleem, what also stands out is their chicken burger. i love the taste and the generous size of the burger bun.
we usually eat chicken burger from this place and the taste never disappoints.
chicken burger is stuffed with minced meat, few veggies like tomatoes and nice white sauce.

haleem of course is the one we try during festive season. overall its a good bakery for snacks & cakes.",4,Positive
"i am so disappointed with what i just had today from pista house, gachibowli, that i don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.

i have had mutton kheema biriyani earlier from pista house - kondapur & nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for kheema biriyani from the gachibowli outlet.  all my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, i am not being overly critical at all. i don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

not sure, if pista house would be be even interested to take this comment seriously or act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least i request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

what was bad with the biriyani -

1. it was all rice and no kheema
2. this is not at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (nizampet & kondapur)
3. trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in container , pista house - gachibowli deliver in foil packet )
 
my order details -

through swiggy order no: #16352555425
, 2 portions of supposed to be kheema biriyani .

no thanks for ruining the friday lunch experience.",1,Very Negative

"heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home. so i finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself. (high expectations)

the place was nowhere near what i had imagined. the restaurant wasn't a very neat and hygienic place, the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty. the people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in.
moving on to the good part, the food was cleaner than most non veg places in hyderabad with the chicken having a little less oil than most places. the desserts looked sumptuous (even though i was full for them, i manged to take some pictures of them)

so from now on i am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if i go there, it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts!",3,Neutral

service guy mr raj was too helpful with suggestions .
worth the visit if your in hyderabad.",5,Positive

"pista house‚Äôs haleem is what i look forward to always. on a vacation to nizam‚Äôs hyderabad, we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose:

dum ka murg & tandoori roti.

a little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience. didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you. no doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt. they should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace.

next will try their haleem and some desserts too.",3,Neutral

always knew about their haleem and was surprised to taste their mughai range.

the food was delicious and quite easy on pockets. the place is divided into two sections, inside there is a private eating space good for families.

the quality and quantity of the food was satisfying.

the staff was friendly and super-fast.

you definitely can try this one when you‚Äôre around this area be it for a quite bite or proper spread.",5,Positive

i was here for dinner with friends during ramadan to try their haleem and gorge on some mughlai delicacies they offer.

when i entered the place it was packed with people in queue waiting to be seated.

coming to the food, i totally loved their malai chicken and pathar ka gosht. juicy and tender. their haleem was yummy too.  i ended up trying their bakery section and wasn't disappointed either.
the desserts like dry fruit kheer and mulberry cream bowl was amazing and we had party in our mouths.

however, there's definitely room for improvement in the hospitality front and this will a big hit with families.
good food & quantity, along with great prices is a steal deal combination and would definitely be here soon.",4,Positive
visited this place on ramadan and we ordered 6 haleem we where 4 all we thought that we can enjoy the real taste of haleem and the bitter truth was the taste was long gone with the moving season .. seriously there is something wrong with this branch too many uncooked bones and intestines . all i can just say is one bad taste is enough to make all the good once bad ..,1,Very Negative
"went to this place on a weekday. then also i found this place having a crowd. this is a perfect family and friends restaurant.
the quantity of this restaurant is very nice and fulfilling. this place is good for people considering less spicy option. there are variety of dishes available here.

i ordered pahadi chicken in starter. it had this taste of spinach and it tasted good with mint chutney otherwise quite bland. but the chicken was cooked properly.
i ordered special chicken curry in main course. that was bits of small chicken in rich gravy. it was good not very awesome.

must try dish is non-veg chinese platter in which we get fish, prawns, chicken drumsticks and other 2 types of chicken also. it costs around 800/- but it is definitely very much worthy. and the butter naan was so soft n nice. and the assorted chicken mandi was also yummy.
overall it is one of the best restaurants i have visited. everything was satisfactory.",4,Positive
"we went for a lunch outing here. it‚Äôs located at dlf. the ambience is good and we expected a good meal. we ordered chicken tangdi, mutton biryani and coke. first thing we got was chicken tangdi and what i instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn‚Äôt juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. this made our expectations very low.

in the mean time, i asked them to get the coke i ordered; it wasn‚Äôt chilled. hence, i requested them to get ice. to my surprise, they had no ice.

and finally, we got our biryani. it was not bad; but, there were no meaty pieces of mutton; only bones.

my advice to you all would be that the food is edible but don‚Äôt keep your expectations too high.",1,Very Negative

"well... after going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place. we opted to go for buffet option. the taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot. coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. out of the non veg starters apart from tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. especially apollo fish was not even cooked properly. out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that‚Äôs what my vegetarian friends said. coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with maida which i never try. the only thing i liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. starting from chicken biryani and sweets like gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (probably they forgot to turn on the burners). finally it‚Äôs ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. on a whole it was a bad experience. i would like to suggest the management one thing, if you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better don‚Äôt.",2,Negative
"clean and neat place for some arabian food as we usually get to see some unhygienic places for this cuisine and mainly mandi.

being a restaurant, as they call it (i would term it as a local tiffin centre).
they charge you for a buffet when what they have is the bare minimum ‚Äî 2 curries, 1 dal as their main course. btw, ice cream served in disposable bowl was their special. üòÅ
food was tasteless, their veg hara bhara kebab was stale. earlier i felt their non veg would be good, probably the reason for the rating. but to my surprise, my foodie friends (non veg lovers) said it was worse than veg. mind you, it happens rarely with them, they can over rate any average non veg restaurant. but this was worse.
i am forced to believe the reviews are paid.",1,Very Negative

"as a north indian joint in hyderabad, marsala food company doesn't disappoint at all. and being a gold partner, things become even better.
we ordered crispy salt and pepper vegtables as a starter which was a good portion size and enough for two people to share.
for main course we went with the recommendation of paneer lababdar with garlic naan. the quantity was enough for two people and the paneer lababdar was medium spicy. it was made just like how it is made in the north.
if someone is looking for north indian, marsala food company should be tried!",4,Positive

"good place,order makes you to wait but when the order come the taste of food makes you feel good,friendly staff #sajan#take my order usually i have been to marsala many times",5,Positive
we went as a group of 17 people for the buffet. there was widespread of starters 4 non veg and 4 veg. all the starters were good. the main course was ok and the desserts were good but they were not available after some time. it is a good place and worth the visit for the cost.,4,Positive
"thanks @marsalafoodcompany01 for hosting us and for being such an attentive host üòä
.
.
heard a lot about @marsalafoodcompany01 before, but never that we thought that we will have such an amazing experience
.
.
few days back we headed marsala for dinner. the moment we entered, it was so beautiful to see lights and colors everywhere.
.
when the ambience is good, it already makes half the things right
.
we had some awesome starters like: arabian chicken soup, paneer papdi kabab, fish 65, chicken lahori tikka, golden fried babycorn üòã
.
all of them tasted heaven, but our personal fav was paneer papdi kabab, chicken lahori and golden fried babycorn üíØ
.
in main course had a massive fish grilled mandi..burrrppp!! üôà and then had the 2 beauties who came to tingle our tastebuds: kit-kat shake and chocolate milkshake

"i visited this place with my fellow bloggers. we had all come here for lunch. a place which has been always highly rated and this visit was pending for quite some time. we all came here with a lot of expectations and marsala food company didn't dissapoint us at all. we tasted a lot of items on the menu. the best and my personal favorite was the kit kat shake. it was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets. the lemon coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg wonton soup was good. it is not a must try and can be avoided ! nothing special about it ! this was the only item that wasn't very good .deep fried panner with a lot of masala ! undoubtedly one of the best on the menu it is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice . the rice is topped with few manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables. a treat for the mouth! we also ordered the veg curry and few rotis. we were all happy with the curry and rotis . the gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day. especially the gulab jamun !
fresh and juicy dipped in the right quantity of sugar solution ! even the people who don't have a sweet tooth will love it! a place that is a must visit",5,Positive
"nothing good. tried buffet. you need to get your plates for starters. water will be provided only if you ask. starters are not at all good, especially fish. we didn't seen any difference in look between fish and baby corn. main course is limited and are not available readily for us. we need to wait for 10min to get curries. roti are pathetic, not fresh. even desserts are bad. only good thing is icecream which is served in single cup",1,Very Negative
"marsala food company located near dlf gachibowli, is a multi cuisine restaurant serving arabian, chinese and some indian dishes. this has been on my wish list from so long. so made a visit here, with a bunch of friends and the place is simple.

over all a decent place to visit with some good ambience.",5,Positive
"been to this place after looking at the ratings. we had a mushroom moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness. in the main course we had chicken biryani which was just decent with bland taste and little masala. the service was decent and so as the ambience.
i would rate this place as
food - 3/5
service - 3.5/5
ambience - 3.5/5",3,Neutral
"visited this place recently as it has become the talk of the town .
we started off with paneer papdi kebab and chilly paneer with crispy corn and veg sheek kebab from the veg starters. extremely delicious and my favorite was the chilly paneer.
the non veg starters were haryali fish tikka ,chilly basil prawns and lahori chicken kebab.
the chilly basil prawns were really good and perfect in every way.
the showstoppers were the mutton juicy mandi and the fish mandi! such a perfect taste of the mandi rice. can easily compete with barkas mandi houses.
the desserts, well we tried them all like the apricot delight , shahi tukda, kaddu ki kheer and my personal favourite gulab jamun.
the awesome dish unknown to people who visit this place is the kitkat shake. really do try the kitkat shake.
highly recommend this place to everyone.",5,Positive
"it can't be expressed in words.. the prompt service they gave, the taste of freshly cooked tandoori chicken with perfect spice & appearance, the authentic taste of chicken tikka biryani (10000 times better that paradise biryani), the perfect type of ambience & a variety of sitting place with outside road view.... all were amazing and more than expectation. u will find little expensive at begining.. but trust me, the quality and quantity they provides, is really value for money. just go and visit once at least.

thanks",5,Positive
"visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. we cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (inr 500 extra for the items cancelled).
reason stated by the staff - if you won‚Äôt pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. when asked for salad (thrice), no one served. ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. even this wasn‚Äôt noticed by anyone.
3. not happy with the quality of food. ordered ‚Äúpapdi paneer kebab‚Äù as per the staff recommendation. it was dry and not good. we told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. there are many staff members but lack of management.

highly disappointed.",1,Very Negative
"i heard so much about this place and i finally got to visit. i was there with few of my friends where we got to try their traditional authentic dishes.
the ambience was nice and it was very spacious with good seating arrangement. the staff is very friendly and courteous. the service is also quite fast.
we first started off with arabian chicken soup and a veg soup.

then we tried their starters paneer papdi kebab, veg sheekh kebab, lahori chicken kebab, golden fried babycorn, fish hariyali, chilli basil prawn, chilli paneer and crispy corn chilli pepper.

for the maincourse we first tried grilled fish mandi and mutton juicy mandi. i wished mandi was more flavourful but the grilled fish which was served with mandi saved the day.
then we tried special fried rice with veg manchurian, special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian and also veg kolhari curry and butter chicken with few breads.

we also tried few mocktails virgin mojito, kotkat milkshake and chocolate milkshkae.

we finally ended our meal with few desserts gulab jamun, apricol delight, double ka meetha and kheer",5,Positive
"it was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place.
.
.

the place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
there are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one i had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing i tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
the main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
the most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
which had the gulab jamun
the shahi tukda
the kuddi ki kheer
the khubani ka mittha.
...
...
was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

"the food of the place was nice except for ‚Äòmurg malai tikka‚Äô, the dish was very sweet and not worth for money. the reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu. the staff doesn‚Äôt know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is ‚Äúcool‚Äù behaviour.

require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location",3,Neutral
"today i visited this place along with a few friends.located at the third level of a building right opposite dlf it is at an easily reachable location.the lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.the dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.one can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.the ambience is good.the place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
now coming to the food i felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
we started with soups.we had the arabian chicken soup and the lemon corriander soup.the arabian chicken soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.on the other hand the lemon corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
next we had starters.chicken pahadi- the pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.the pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.the flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.next we had paneer papdi kebab.this is batter fried paneer slices.the batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.kung pao mushroom was okayish.it tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in kung pao dishes.dragon chicken and hariyali fish tikka both were amazing.i do recommend these.golden fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.it was good but did not feel like having prawns.golden fried baby corn was also good.chilli paneer was disappointing.the paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.lahori chicken kabab was also pretty good.mushroom moti tikki is something i would avoid.i did not like it but i feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.it is khova filled mushrooms.i could not eat it and so i am not recommending this but you could give it a try.what if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
next we had mandis.the juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the chicken mandi.the rice of the mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.the fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.the pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.the fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.the fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.the best mandi you ask then definitely go for the chicken mandi.
we also had some milkshakes- kitkat,butterscotch and strawberry.i loved the kitkat milkshake the most.it had chunks of kitkat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.the milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
now coming to desserts. i was not that satisfied with the desserts.the kaddu ki kheer was really good.we also had double ka meetha which i feel was too dry and a bit hard too.also the gulab jamuns also could improve a bit.they were not bad but not really good too.we also had qubani ka meetha which was okay.
overall i would say most of the non veg starters were good and the mandis too are good.the desserts need improvement.the place is definitely worth a visit.",5,Positive
"customers won't really care about your ambience or service if your food quality is below par. i ordered chicken dum biryani from here, relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad. the chicken tasted horrible and was stale. i had to throw away the biryani. you guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. i value food which is worth the money spent and i feel betrayed here. i contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. they should have issued a proper refund here. i did not expect this kind of service and i really don't look forward to trying anything from this place in future.",1,Very Negative

"sharing my experience at marsala food company as soon as you enter just have a look at the the roof decor it's just amazing and when you get in further to the seating area you'll find the regular dinning tables and chairs and then you'll also find couches and tables well as this place serves arabian food specifically for mandi ppl some ppl prefer seating on the couches and making themselves comfortable while enjoying their meal the decor is decent and the service was also good let me start with the food review now so i had arabian chicken soup which was so rich and creamy next

i got my hands on their starters like

chicken pahadi kkebab
chicken banjara kebab
kung pao mushroom
paneer papdi kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon chicken lahori chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what i liked the most among the starters were kung pao mushroom dragon chicken and banjara kebab and i felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

getting into the main course now i tried mutton juicy mandi chicken tangdi mandi and grilled fish mandi i personally liked chicken tangdi mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as i love spicy food

treating myself with the milkshakes and desserts now in milkshakes i tried chocolate, butterscotch and kitkat i liked the kitkat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then kitkat as a cherry on the top and in desserts i had gajar ka halwa double ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer i liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar ka halwa and double ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all i would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper arabian meal !!",5,Positive

main course: ordered paneer tikka biryani, and butter naan along with kaju paneer. the butter naan and the curry were decent but the paneer tikka biryani was the best paneer biryani i've ever tasted. the paneer pieces were soft and creamy and the rice had a rich taste to it. though the biryani could've used a little more spice, it tasted great! 

ambiance & service: this is an evening place for sure and we visited there for lunch. so couldn't really comment on that but whatever we could see looked very good. one complaint was that our seats were directly beside a bare glass and we got scorched in the sun for 40 mins before we could get a table away from it. avoid the seats beside the glass during afternoon hours. the service was a little late but the staff was friendly. kudos to that! 

p.s. the only thing stopping me from giving a 3 star is that biryani and those soups! loved them so much that i couldn't give them a 3!",4,Positive
i have visited this restaurant with a group of 10 people. i have also ordered from here online. the food quality was not upto the mark for both the cases. the food served to us was stale. the ambience is nice though and the staffs are friendly too.,2,Negative

"ordered mutton biryani after reading good reviews. and the result is bad. rice itself was so bland. mutton pieces looks melting but the aroma and taste of the pieces also bad. so bad that i could not even finish any single piece completely. on the whole, if you are here for mutton biryani, i recommend not to take. fyi, i'm hyderabadi biryani lover.",1,Very Negative

"this restaurant was too good in serving food - both quantity and quality wise. all the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity. ambience was good. we had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish tikka. main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.

we got 2 of them as complimentary with gold.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. service was extra ordinary. totally worth the gold visit. looking forward to try other dishes here :)",5,Positive
"i gotta tell you this is the best place in gachibowli with a pocket friendly collection. went here for lunch and unfortunately some part of this store is not really having shades which resulted in sunlight falling on us while lunch. did not feel comfortable while seating there, later we moved on to different table.

        ambiance pretty normal not so catchy but i would say evenings are the best time to visit this place. service is good, quite descent number of servers. impressed with their work polite, calm and patient. having enough said about the service and ambiance let's skip into the food!

veg corn soup: touch of the sweet corn along with the hot sour soup, the veg soup tasted extremely well.

tomato : crispy bread crums soaked in the sweet tomato soup gives you a mouth watering feeling right when it gets to your table.

chicken soup: i would say this is the best chicken soup i ever had. minced chicken along with the soup can give you the best taste.

mutton shorba: well, this is also a mouth watering dish over here, loved the taste of shorba. the hot soup served with the piece of mutton, can really make your day!!

  
crispy corn : spicy enough as well as crispy enough this starter really gave us a boost! 

chicken spring roll: this is where i was pretty disappointed because they failed to impress us. not really tasty though. 

loose prawns : neatly washed and perfectly grilled the loose prawns were delicious resulting in craving for more.

chicken chettinad : well cooked well marinated with enough spices the chettinad curry really satisfied our need. 

chicken mughlai : spicy enough, delicious enough just satisfying the need for spicy indian food, this dish never dissapoints you. 

panner biryani : wasn't really impressed with panner biryani though, it could do better. 

chicken biryani: since i am not a fan of cardamom the usage of cardamom in biryani makes me go crazy but this place and moderately put up cardamom in biryani adding it a slight flavour. i suggest it's better to ask before preparing the food.

"the ambience was decent, but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded (understandable!). the music was good, the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us. we actually became a little uncomfortable after that, because we were right in front of him, waving hands (not drunk at all, because we were asking for out first drink of the night), and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us. looks like he had something againts us! ;)",3,Neutral

great for people who want some fun on weekdays",3,Neutral
we went there around 8.30 for having a fun night. but the place turned out to be a cheap place where people are allowed to smoke everywhere. we cant even breathe properly.then we order vodka..it was like water and when we questioned them he smiled and kind of agreed.then we ordered long island tea and asked him to make it a good one but it was even worse. even their virgin mohito was not gud.then the food was also okish.staff were also not courteous.i find the place was overcrowded. it seemed they have allowed stag entries and they were passing cheap comment on us.i will never recommend anyone here.,1,Very Negative
okay ! this place seems okay not so great. tables are too small in which we cannot put more than three food items. and it was saturday night the dj supposed to start at 8pm we were waiting for the songs to be played till 9:30pm yet no music nothing. and we left the place.,3,Neutral
one the best places to hangout specially when you don't want to spend much . the food is great and going in the group would be best . the music and ambience is actually worth it. but please book a table before 8 on weekends as it gets much crowded. recommended places to go .,5,Positive
club rogue is a nice place to hangout with friends and have a laid back beer on a weekday as well. the service is excellent. the menu has lots of options in veg as well as non veg. the dj was excellent and we had the time of our lives dancing. the crowd was amazing. there are lots of options in drinks as well. must visit.,4,Positive
"club rogue ... located in gachibowli is a good place party and dance if you have gone out with your friends on weekends. the place is usually full and suggestion would be to go in early and get yourself a table. here you can have some drinks and then dance and yes the food is also quite good. only issues .... the tables are small, and hence not much can be placed on the table. saw lots of bottles fall and break. but regardless, this is a good place if you really wanna party hard.",4,Positive
"whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who don't smoke.

i went to this club with my friends around 8. it was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. there is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience i had. whichever club, i have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. the restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. but here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. it was all dark! i think they really took ""rogue"" word to another level.
i couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.
i would really want club rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and i think the same was felt by so many people over there.",1,Very Negative
"ambience sucks... worst service.... they don't book tables and when i asked a waiter for a table for 4, he just ignores and stares away... when we managed to make a waiter arrange a table for us, he just keeps a table in the middle of the way and asks us to stand throughout our course for the evening... well we finally made to a normal table by waiting for others to vacate.... i highly recommend not to go to this place.... just sitting outside the building and talking to my friends was lot better than ruining our evening by going to this shitty place...",1,Very Negative

"been to club rogue last saturday i.e. 13th april 2019. we chose this place as it was a bollywood night. lot of things to get told about this place.
first, coming to the ambience. it's a nice big place. the pricing is reasonable. we were given a place of our liking after a little followup.
now coming to the attitude & rules of the club. the entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- nil! in spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. the dance floor was unchecked. anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.
the bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! i don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing bollywood music.
overall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.
service was good. we were attended to well, by our server mr. kunal.",2,Negative
manager was so cheap n attitude showing ego to the guest ..we visited thrice this time .. management pliz take serious action to the manager or else he vil let the business down..,1,Very Negative
"recently been to this place. good food and economically priced. service was also good.
most disappointing part is their crowd management. when they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. no bouncers to check what is going on floor. stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. just for their business they r letting everyone in.
i will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. as there is no security for them. one should enjoy the party but with some limits.
the management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a rouge place. lot of cheap crowd on saturday night better to avoid.",2,Negative

"cheap place.
really bad service.

this place has a quiet weird rule. if you show your office id card they‚Äôll not be charging a cover amount. else you‚Äôll have to pay a cover charge.

the bar attenders are so ill mannered, i was almost about to slap one.
if you can‚Äôt talk to a customer politely, then maybe you should not work at a bar!
i‚Äôve asked for a budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that i ordered kingfisher. (i‚Äôm okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious).

food was average and served medium hot (i think i was served someone else‚Äôs cancelled order item)

music was terrible! there was some desi dj who was playing songs out of youtube and there was no quality mixing.

the way they rush guests out after 12 is too bad.",2,Negative
this place is usual hangout place for guys as it allows to enter if you have a corporate id.also this place is packed almost everyday.you get to hear all types of music in one night so yeah it is worth going here to dance and habe fun.getting a table here is bit difficult due to the crowd.food and drinks are cheap here.one thing i dont like here is people who dont know how to behave on dance floor with girls.that annoys me a lot.but that is not a frequent thing and can be fixed by bouncers being more proactive.thanks,4,Positive
"thrice i visited this place thinking it might change my opinion but as always it was a disappointment. the staff and the manager extremely rude the service really bad. looks like the place does not need customers at all coz i haven‚Äôt come across any waiter who would refuse to serve. complained to the manger who was equally rude !
food and drinks are alright but i got wine served in a plastic foggy glass üòì i go out for the experience when i spend money üí∞. i‚Äôm not sure about the others but i had a horrible experience.",2,Negative
"read mixed reviews about this place. but the only thing which dragged us here is that the dj here plays bollywood songs and we were satisfied with the dj and the dance floor. the place is also very beautiful. but the service here sucks, the waiters are rude. we couldn't order food as the waiters weren't responding properly. even for drinks (tired of waiting for them to take order) we went to the bar and ordered.
so if you you to enjoy only the dance floor, only them i would recommend this place.",3,Neutral
the manager named siddarth was treating us very badly. we went with a few girls. the other guys around were teasing our friends. when we asked him he said he can't do anything. he does not have minimum courtesy to talk politely with the customers. the staff lack basic professionalism. one of my worst experiences.,1,Very Negative

this is for the manager who was outside at the gate. 23rd march, 2019. we were three friends, and the bouncer at the gate asked for company id, as we were stags. one of my friend called another, who was on the way, whether he was carrying his id proof.
in the mean time that manager appeared at the gate.
we went to the gate and showed the id, but he looked at us head to toe, and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge. without any reason.
some other stag groups were entering; just showing company id.
but this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group.

is this the way your managers handle clients?",1,Very Negative

"over all good experience but

cons: entry only for ppl who show corporate id is kinda too much. and also rude behaviour of bouncers. instead of making us feel safe, they themselves scares the customers.

"1. bollywood music starts only after 10.30 pm. dont fall for the incorrect timings posted here. before that, its routine boring music which is unnecessary loud and you cant converse

4. food & ambience & service is fine.
5. drinks are below average. liit was okay.
i asked for fresh lime soda with salt only and even after returning once, i got it mixed with sugar syrup and without fresh lemon.

the service was the worst.. all of my friends went to the dance floor and i was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card. this was pretty humiliating. this place probably sees too many dine & dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to.
the food was average at best.
they entered ‚Çπ200 as tip on the pos machine trying us to pay that for this s***ty service.
the valet meddled with my car's infotainment system.

"i am thinking where to start, there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2-3 hours of time we spent there. we were a group of 8, we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us.
to start with, the place does not have well groomed and professional staff, they hardly understand what you speak.
the first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10, we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us. as soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 pm then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. we told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.
secondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don't have any. we had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.
the service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.
we were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 pm, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 pm saying by they serve it would cross 7 pm. doesn't that sound ridiculous?
again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping i suggested my friends that we should go to 10d, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10d they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the manager.
the manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the manager said ""ok sir, we are also dangerous people"" we were shocked at this.
our evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.
this place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever.",1,Very Negative
greetings. the ambience is good ( okayish! ) with artificial plants towards the gallery area. too dark for a pub. sitting is good. dedicated dance floor with good hindi new and old songs to garnish upon. too loud though. don‚Äôt have draught beer. have pint prices slightly towards higher side. crispy corn made the day ( night! ). do try!,3,Neutral

"very unprofessional and rude staffs. if you order 2 beers, they will insist for a bucket and if you do not order a bucket, they will take half an hour to bring your order. the place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort. then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded, orders can't be processed properly. despite all that inconvenience and bad service, they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay. crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded. music and dj is good with cheap food and drinks, which is a crowd puller. one can have a really nice time if you can bear all these and if crowd is what attracts you.",1,Very Negative

"an amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
food : decently priced, huge helpings. one dish likely to suffice for two. unless, of course... ;)
drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. what else could one ask for? unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) beer bucket prices ~900. so... yeah good place to get the buzz.
dance : the heart and soul of the place. djs do a great job, generally. it's edm untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of punjabi, bollywood and popular english. if you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the dj plays. but every other day, he/she does surprise you.

fridays and saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (just saying)

pasta arabiatta is one of my favourites with the right amount of sauce and seasoning which makes it a perfect dish for all occasions.  the homestyle chicken is also very delectable and mouthwatering.  all the flavor is kept in while cooking and goes well with a good cocktail .

sweet corn soup chicken - this is better than clear soup

"this review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so.

so 4 of us visited mazzo on the 14th of feb and chose the veg & non-veg options accordingly from their menu, pre-decided. at 2500 inr plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.

imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite. 

1. the linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it. 
2. the livery was stained.
3. the restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.
4. instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.
5. the cream of asparagus soup was like toilet water. so was the avocado chicken corn chowder soup. they refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. what else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?
6. the bharwab subz kebab was dry like dried meat, the grilled buffalo chicken was terrible smelling only - how to eat?, the lamb galouti was decent and the vegetable lumpia was oily and tiny. - all in all the appetizers were equally useless.
7. moving onto the main course now - for the vegetarian me, i was given a choice between the anjeer kesar kofte and spinach & ricotta ravioli. i obviously chose the latter d-uh. big mistake. when i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. then why keep it under the lamp for so long? and the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking chaasni - the sugar water from the rasgulla or gulab jamun dabba.
8. not like the non-vegetarians had it any better. 6 hours braised lamb shank or nalli nihari or murgh methi. 
lamb - it was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.
nalli nihari - more like nal ka paani. no taste no nihari.
murgh methi - whywhywhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. roti you ask? - please do not.
9. and last but not the least, dessert.
vanilla bean pannacotta - i make better pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. the coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.
kesar malai kulfi - this was bought from scoops. the server told us also. the only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic. ate 4 and went home.",1,Very Negative

we wanted to have small reunion of our old colleagues and being friday it was difficult to get any quite place so we talk and send some quality time. friend recommended mazzo but the time we came the pool side area was full but we requested after sometime the staff arranged a place near the pool area. the ambience is very beautiful and romantic. on the 13tb floor next to pool having drinks and food with your close friends was a great experience. i would definitely recommend this place to all. food was very tasty and filling. after ages i must have had so tasty and upto the mark rogan ghosh. i would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time. the only 1 part i would suggest as improvement will be the wait area for giving the order and receiving the food on the table...rest it was a beautiful experience.,5,Positive

it is ultimate place if you want to have romantic date with your loved one at poolside.. basically this is rooftop place with outdoor seating arrangement on poolside with live ipl and indoor seating arrangement with some light music.loved their ambiance..

my review is based on session invite..

soup - coconut thai soup which was amazing..it has creamy consistency and that coconut flavor and thai spices were enhancing it's taste to the next level..

in starter, we tried beetroot paneer tikka which was damn good..paneer was marinated in beetroot gravy and they barbeque it and served it with green chutney .taste wise it was good..

sikampuri kebab - this was show stealer dish of the day..it was stuffed with many ingredients like casher,potato, capsicum,green peas, onion, khoya, kismis and the list goes on..it was luscious..must try

mocktails,
mango mint - it was one of the show stealer mocktail..the hint of mint and mango flavor was refreshing...

apple cooler - it was sundowner mocktail..very refreshing..apple chunks and mint leaves were giving fresh punch to the drink.

in main course,

stuffed capsicum - this is one of my favorite dish from childhood but trust me nobody can beat this taste.. .. capsicum was cooked and soft enough from outside and the consistency of stuffing was adequate.. loved it and i would like to day plating was damn attractive..

malai kofta - lt was presented in a big pate with small modak shape kofta with creamy and luscious gravy..kofta was stuffed with paneer, khoya and some spices and to balance the taste gravy was little son sweet side..it lip smacking good..

in desserts we tried hot brownie with vanilla ice cream. brownie was soft enough and sweetness was balanced..it was heavenly good .

my overall experience was amazing..chef bhuvnesh was helpful us through out our dinning time.mr.nitin made our dinning experiences comfortable and memorable... i would like to mention that every staff member was so friendly and helpful too... loved their hospitality..

i would definitely recommend this place to have a one of the best experience with food and ambiance..",5,Positive

looking for a romantic dinner? i would say this is one of the best place in hyderabad. amazing ambience along the poolside. my review is based on the session invite.

we started our dinner with thai coconut soup. perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. it was very tasty.

in starters, we were served beetroot paneer tikka and sikampuri kebab. plating was very tempting. paneer tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. and the kebab, it was the best sikampuri kebab i have ever had. perfectly cooked and moist inside.

in mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. i just loved the latter one. it was very refreshing.

then comes the main course. we had malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. must try with their herb paratha. we also had stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in india. if you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.

in dessert, i had brownie with vanilla ice cream. brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.

overall, my experience was amazing with mazzo. bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. i also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.",5,Positive

coming to food ist was good and worth the price

"as the name suggests, its supposed to be a marriott and that's what you expect. the reality is very different.

let's start with my experience even before reaching. i was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. and so i did.
i was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. i was happy.

it has a separate entrance in sln terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
now let's talk real business.

upon reaching i see the place completely empty. maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. i didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. the whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. it's very mediocre.

staff: the worst service ever. i have had better service in small restaurants or even small dhabas if i may compare them. i had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. there is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

i asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""andar koi nahi baithta"" (no one sits inside)
if you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

there was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. we had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

being a marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if i'm paying with card i have to come to the billing counter and pay there. such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

food: there was hair in the food. starters were okay but main course was very bad. and let me make special note of the dessert.

if i'm coming for a buffet in such a place, i'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. they bought kaaju kathli, rasgulla, some barfi among some cake etc. and no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. i've attached pictures

after paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. when we tried to express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. i'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

it was the most disappointing experience i ever had in hyderabad. marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. i will for sure never come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",1,Very Negative
"the ambience was really nice, rooftop view makes it for a quiet romantic outing, the staff were nice. but the food was served cold and wasn't up to to the marriott standards. breathtaking view and the quaint corner near to the pool balanced our entire evening.",3,Neutral
"this place has an awesome ambiance, it is really worthy to spend money on this place. it is the best place to chill out with girlfriends üòú but the food it just average",3,Neutral
"it‚Äôs true that ambiance is good, but the staff has failed to direct me to the restaurant. though i requested to book a poolside table they didn‚Äôt reserve, only the buffet people will have access to it, it seems. food was good. but the staff was not professional enough.",1,Very Negative
"ask for a five star experience..will sing this experience for lifetime..
ambience-(10/5) i was awestruck. everything related to this place was awesome. the pool side was international standard. the view would ease all the tiredness which you ever had. the place would bring a certain calmness which you would cherish for very long time. i thought my paisa wasul from this ambience itself.

food-(4/5) everything in the buffet was good. starters tikka n roll was really good. the welcome drink was also really good.

service(5/5) they have certain standards and they really live up to the reputation. really enjoyed their hospitality.

i suggest everyone to have the experience of the wonderful ambience.",5,Positive
"first of all the ambience was just breathtaking, there was around the pool, i really like pool side sitting arrangement and light soothing music , very quiet place . best for couples

service was great and quick . the staff was very polite and humble . i really like the way they treat customers . you will definitely get a vip like treatment there üòâ .

coming to the food , we ordered chicken tikka, paneer makhani and naan . all the three dishes was great . perfect combination of all spices neither too much nor too less , just the right amount of spices and other stuffs.
in drinks we ordered liit (long island ice tea) and minty mango , drinks was also good.

this place was bit expensive but worth paying money.",5,Positive
amazing place with amazing view. you have to sit outside near poolside when you go here. great drinks but average food. amazing ambience especially with poolside table. overall 4 /5.,4,Positive
"the only reason this place gets a two is because they‚Äôve got the best ambiance and the food in brunches is very very good. but trust me, they have to change their attitude towards the customers. we were 6 people went there by making a prior reservation for brunch and to continue till late evening after brunch. the reservation was confirmed, and it was all good until the brunch was over. we wanted to continue after brunch to dinner and we agreed to pay whatever we consume after the brunch hours. an hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they‚Äôve reservations. i informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue. however, we all agreed to leave and asked for bill. here is the twist, the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cash/card from us. they made us wait for more than 1.5 hours and all this while, no table was occupied. it was all empty! i went to the manager and asked him if he can help us checkout, and confronted about the reservations. the manager now tells me to continue till dinner. i did not understand the issue they had and never bothered to ask too. we all left and agreed to never go back there again.",2,Negative

the only thing is there could be more lights, it's quite dim at some sections",4,Positive
"this place is worth a visit! a rooftop with a pool - the ambience is just awesome, specially in the evenings. one of the best places for small parties/romantic dinners.
a good range of food is available. have tried thai curry and it‚Äôs one of the best i‚Äôve had.",4,Positive

"jaw dropping ambience!!

the place is on 13th floor, it has 2 sections open pool side and inside area. pool side is the place where you should be sitting.

i ordered biryani which was pretty nice just that it's with bone and some extra masala's i could taste in it.
must try ice tea and chocolate milkshake!!

staff is quite polite.
valet parking
they don't take reservations after 9pm
usually over phone they say the pool side is full but you'll get some seats available for sure.

the buffet is good and rather than the ala carte. 10/10 for the decor and ambience. the service was quick. beautiful view of hyderabad. a must visit place.,4,Positive
"elegant ambience, can't say stellar but an interesting place. for its suave, it ought to visited.
brownie tasted perfect. for a moment didn't know if it was really tasty or i was just hungry, my date voted the former idea. it was delectable anyway. üòÄ
chicken tikka kebab was good enough for me as a first timer. probably the second time, i may not stop appreciating the taste of kebabs at bawarchis-green, red, gold or vibgyor at each of those street corners.
i was optimistic enough to ignore consequences of only i among two of us decided to have buffet. hope against hope perhaps, the guy said that we can't share from one buffet order. voila, i also had to give up buffet. (i can't force the lady to have it when she wasn't keen about it.) thatz the 4 stars, else an easy 5üå† experience.
best place for photographs; one can cherish the look at botanical garden, chunk of greenery with a silver traffic lining from the rooftop.

"the place is pretty beautiful with serene ambience with a poolside sitting.
the food was also pretty good but was disappointed with the biryani served as it wasn't hot but just a tad warm which certainly affected the taste.
the service staff were also very friendly.
would definitely recommend if you are looking for a nice and a calm dinner with the loved ones.",4,Positive
"reach out to @thehedonisticbhukkad on instagram for more! :)

visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.

ambience - simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) this place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. the place is brightly lit and relaxing. though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.

service - gopal was our server for the day. courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. the staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.

food - we ordered two drinks(i can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. ordered caprese bruschetta and creamy pesto penne pasta.
i've tried bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way i did here. the freshness of toppings was evident. the pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.

overall, dining at mazzo is an indulgence. the prices might seem steep for some, but for the experience it provides, it is definitely worth a visit.",5,Positive

"hyderabad's best rooftop as of now. with an unparalleled ambience, mazzo is hands down the prettiest pool side eatery i have visited in town. evenings here are absolutely beautiful, sunrises and sunsets are magical. open 24/7 this rooftop will have you falling in love all around the year.

ive tried their sunday brunch. and it's an experience you don't want to miss. i won't exaggerate, the food isn't out of this world. it's decent. a respectable salad bar",4,Positive
5/5 for the ambience. the pool side tables under the starry sky is the best - super romantic. no complaints with the food. the bruschetta is great but only if you have a taste for english food with a sparkle of indian touch.,5,Positive
"this was my first visit to this place. hospitality is something that needs to be practiced and valued and manager ""mani"" mastered it! received a warm welcome from the staff. wonderful experience with the service and hospitality and food was ofcourse damn yumm!!

"mazzo, located on top of sln terminus, is the dining wing, for marriott‚Äôs modern extended-stay apartment hotel.
marriott is known for it‚Äôs hospitality, and you will experience that, here at mazzo.

i went to mazzo, for lunch on a sultry afternoon. the view by the pool was spectacular, and breathtaking.
i could totally see, how this can be the most perfect date place.

i had a continental meal, and boy was it amazing! i had a few dishes out of the menu, and complements to the chef, amit, for getting everything so right.

i had indian shorba and fish n chips for starters; pork chops and spaghetti carbonara for my main course; and a brownie with icecream for desert.

every dish was fantastic. but the fish n chips and pork chops blew my mind.

the fish was delicious, and the batter was perfect.

the pork chops were extremely juicy, and cooked to perfection. the mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy. and, how can i forget that demi-glace sauce. beautiful!

the spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love.

plating was just so marriot! elegant yet simple.

and, all of this, while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city.

a heartfelt thank you to the team at mazzo, for putting together such a beautiful meal.",5,Positive
"such a special night to remember when we decided to dine in for a midnight dinner at the beautiful poolside restaurant at marriott hotels. we had made the night special and marriott in turn surprised us with their lip smacking dishes too. we had our hands on few cocktails namely eye of the tiger and bull frog which kept the mood flowing for the night.
the chicken and thyme pasta that night was absolutely delicious as the cheese has melted really well as could really enjoy the real taste. hands on this was the best compared to any pasta i tried in restaurants at hyderabad. absolutely wonderful.
wok tossed hakka noodles too surprised as it lived upto the name of why it‚Äôs called a hakka. it purely means an explosion of different flavours in a noodles and it really was. at above ‚Çπ400 both dishes really is worth the money further considering the hospitality and the ambience of the hotel.

"this is one place where one can spend a lowsy sunday. mr. nitin was courteous enough to welcome us when we reached mazzo. the first view which attracts everyone is the pool side arrangement. as i am a hard core non vegetarian the live counters attracted me the most. the macrail and pork were the best starters of the lot. chef aritra was courteous enough to come and check for the taste of food. he also ensured that my son gets to taste the non spicy foods such as japanese noodles and murtabak. the cocktails served were also as per expectation.
the buffet lunch was good but we all were full to taste them. desert section attracted my son, so we had few chocolate crossant and pastries.
overall a great place to hang out with family and friends. looking forward for evening visit now.",5,Positive
the food was very good and tasty though there were limited options in menu. i liked the ambiance and service more. best time to go would be in the evening.,5,Positive
"i will start off with what impressed me the most and go from there:

service (5/5)
i worked with nitin to host a wedding shower for my sister and brother in law, with a guest list of 30 people. nitin was so easy to talk to and tried his best to accommodate all my requests. his staff was very courteous and even helped me when the decor team came to setup. at the party, they were attentive to all my guests and followed instructions well. nitin even provided me with a speaker so i could play songs during the party. there are a lot of things that could stress someone out when hosting a party, but the location and the staff were not on that list. it is a genuine relief that i had nitin and his team to help me.

ambience (5/5)
the location is perfect if you want to host a party, take someone out on a date or just relax with your friends on a friday evening after work. good aesthetics along with attention to detail makes this place what it is - the rooftop, the pool, the bar, the lounge chairs by the pool, the lighting at night, the city views. 

food (4/5)
i created the food and drinks menu for my guests with help from nitin. mazzo has a huge menu you can choose from if you're hosting a party. i for one was confused with all the choices but nitin's suggestions were well received. appetizers were amazing and main course was pretty good. they even have the option of live stations - pasta, mongolian, chaat etc. overall, diverse options.",5,Positive
"went there for dinner with family,it's located just above sln terminus.
must say it has a terrific ambience and decor, especially loved the poolside view of the place,but the food is strictly average and their service is terribly slow and a big let down.",3,Neutral
"absolutely stunning! from their customer service, ambience to food! from the get go, the manager nitin was helpful and assisted me in organizing an awesome couple shower for my sis and her partner! they let us have the best spot by the pool, let us decorate, served us entree at the table and set up speakers for us play our own music! their service was impeccable through out that night. thanks mazzo & nitin for helping me to make it memorable for my sis and her now husband!

just look at those happy smiles!

thank you mazzo. it was an amazing feeling to eat here.",5,Positive
reservation was confirmed on the phone multiple times as i was hosting a group of 20 people but we didn't have a table when we reached. i was told that i spoke to one employee but the other employee didn't know so its not his responsibility. i however contacted the hotel so not sure how i am supposed to inform all employees for a simple reservation. it was quite an inconvenience because the whole group was made to stand for 15 mins and wait and move tables as well. the staff was not apologetic either so we were quite disappointed. this was a corporate booking with colleagues so we would not have expected this to happen,3,Neutral
"the place has an amazing ambiance, nice seating at rooftop beside the pool with amazing view. and all 3 stars goes for it. but the food is not great at all.. u can go there just to enjoy the view, but food a big no.. the biriyani was very dry, hardly any options for starters or desserts. the staff were extremely courteous and srrvice was also okay.",3,Neutral

"revised review:

it was an absolute delight to be at mazzo. the view is something worth looking forward to. it‚Äôs probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in hyderabad. after a not so pleasant first encounter, i decided to give it another attempt. and boy, this time, it was definitely worth.

we were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste. soon after we were served with fried papad to nibble on and cranberry base mocktail to give some company. the poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening.

a little later, the hot and sour soup arrived. it was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later. for starters, we had veg manchurian and paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip. the veg manchurian was a little more spicy, but tasted good anyway. and the paneer 65 was absolute perfection, with the soft paneer cooked in real balanced masala.

we, then got in veg lasagne and veg biryani for main course. the lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that i had earlier. this had a very different taste, i‚Äôm not comparing in terms of better or worse, just a very different taste. and it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes *winks*. the biryani, as usual, was good. accompanied with this was the apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time i had a sip.

the best was saved for the last. although, we were full to the brim, i couldn‚Äôt leave the beautiful rasmalai untouched. and of course, there‚Äôs always a separate stomach for desserts, so. 

overall, i had a lovely evening with my sister, that day. and i recommend it for dates or business dinners, maybe even hangout with a friend or two, you‚Äôd have a sublime time, regardless of who you‚Äôre with.

old review:

overall rating - 3/5

such a serene ambience, if only it was accompanied by some good food. me and my sister dropped by this place one evening. i was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights. we asked for the menu, a couple times, after which we finally got it. the menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items (like me), you hardly have a choice. we ordered in a subz shammi kebab to start with. the staff took their own sweet time to serve it, but it was toothsome, which compensated for the delayed service (i guess). due to lack of options for drinks, we settled for a salted lassi and a hot chocolate. i don't want to go into much depth, but well, they weren't great. both the drinks had thin consistency. we then went ahead with the vegetable biryani, it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita, but the quantity was less. 

i'm not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason. but, to be perfectly candid, i don't think i would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food. definitely, not worthy enough.",5,Positive
"i have been a regular here @ mazzo. evereybody that has ever accompanied has fallen in love with this place. i would like to point out one special person ""sudhakar"" he is the chef. a very polite and cordial gentleman, exactly sets the mood by dishing out the most mouth watering- smacking dishes. i would like to give him 5 stars for making me every visit memorable",5,Positive
really we enjoyed food here .. thanks for amazing food .. love to visted again and to have a tasty .. thank you sudhar for your tasty food you provide,5,Positive
awesome experience from the beginning. amit and the manager was too customer centric. they had a private party ongoing and they still took care of us very well. my kid was feeling cold so they bought a shovel that was too kind. zomato gold was accepted without any issues. ordered long island ice tea which was perfectly mixed and margarita was awesome. they served the buffet on the table while we were having our drinks. they checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and tasty food. lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday. definitely going to recommend this place for perfect and tasty food. thank you amit and the manager on duty,5,Positive
"we loved the ambience to the fullest. been here for my wife‚Äôs birthday dinner. pool side/ lovely ambience/ buffet dinner - what else you want?
the buffet is simple and nice, nothing so great about the variety, but what ever they have - they are done well.

amit and pratik helped us and made us feel home. thanks guys. appreciate.

"great ambiance with very poor service.

food : 3.5/5 the starters were just ok, main course was a little better. for the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. what disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. it was orange is color and that is definitely not ok. 

ambiance : 5/5 it definitely stands out for its ambiance. lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. one of the most beautiful ambiances among hyderabadi restaurants.

service : 2/5 this is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. and after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

price :  3/5 it is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. but to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves.",3,Neutral

service is very slow which decreases their overall rating.
food quality is good but not great. you can try white sauce chicken pasta, it will not disappoint you.
ambiance is fantastic.
it's a costly affair so pick up only you have something special to celebrate.

food here was good, only hoping for better choices.

there was this lady whose name i can't recall but she when i asked if i can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over, she made them especially for me and delivered on table.

"this outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.

the ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. it was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. it was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.

upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. we were asked if we are here for buffet. the restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. i had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.

the manager at this place was a nice fellow. who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. after a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.

i would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. it was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.

the servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. they were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.

then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. simply put, it was a disaster. the curry was as bland as it could be. most restaurants in this part of india assume that all dishes of punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. we could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. it was just sitting there doing nothing. neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. it was going nowhere.

the problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. it lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. they say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. i am not a fan of multi cuisine. when you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. the restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant north indian population or the traditional south indian population.

one thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their buffet menu. they tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.

had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, i would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.

the restaurant needs to find its footing. the owners need to decide which way they want to go. maybe hire some traditional north indian guys for north cuisine.

"i had ordered food from kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place once(gachibowli). the ambience here is good and the staff was attentive.
the steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. i also tried gongura chicken it was fine. apart from these i tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes.",3,Neutral

"‚Äùreasonable‚Äù

while going healthy and done with enough of biryanis it was time for ragi muda. ordered one ragi muda, the quantity was good, properly boiled and happy to satisfy me. have gone with many orders from this place.

also visited their restaurant in madhapur branch and must say am very happy with the service, food and ambiance.

they have given it a old town look. butter and tandoori naan were amazing with the butavankay curry thick and 3 pieces of brinjal in it. little spicy but absolutely homely food is what i can say about this place.

again ragi muda is my all time favorite from here, no doubt the chutney served with it is deadly spicy. but again you ask for some more ghee or take another curry.",4,Positive
for vegetarians- they have amazing ragi sangati (rice like ball made of ragi) and vangkaya(brinjal made in coconut and nut gravy). the veg biryani was ok but my group really liked the chicken biryani! recommended if you are looking for andhra cuisine.,4,Positive

"i liked the food very much. the best part is the ambience of it, you cannot ask for a better one in hyderabad. it is so peaceful and one could spend hours sitting there. we had a hard time finding parking spot as the parking is full. other than that, i loved this place and would go there again and again!",4,Positive

the place doesn't feel like we are inside the noisy city which is absolutely delightful, but i wish i could say the same about the food and drinks!!

"this was place was a surprise as it is better than you imagine. though it turned out to be a bit hot, the air circulation could have been better. the food and drinks were as how they were described. must try.",4,Positive
"the glass onion is located at a calm and a quiet place. despite being around a km behind infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. while the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.

once you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. they have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. the tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.

the servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. for starters we ordered lotus stem galouti kebab and nachos. the kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. the nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. despite nachos being one of the common starters, i'd still recommend people to try the ones here.

for the main course we ordered the lahori paneer combo that gets served with a small bowl of dal makhni and naan/pulao. the paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the paneer. the dal makhni that came along with the paneer was out of this world. it's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. for something that's prepared so well, i feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.

finally the dessert. tiramisu pastry. simply no words. right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. after a good dinner, the tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.

one small observation that i'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full. towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it. however considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there, i wouldn't penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits.",5,Positive
"truly a hidden gem. this place is situated far from the city, inside emaar courtyard. the have both indoor and outdoor seating, and the ambience is the best part about this place. its just amazing.
the food was also great. something that good be improved is the customer service. there is a bit of delay in getting the orders.
top picks :
- mint cooler
- chicken bbq pizza

the ambience will offset the price you pay. overall, a must visit place.",5,Positive
"this place looks really nice with some good music. they have both outdoor and indoor seating facility and it's a best place to hangout with the family and friends. outdoor seating has an amazing view of the golf ground and can be enjoyed during evening.

they welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.
first we ordered screw driver, tropical delight and mint cooler which was really good.

screw driver - it was a cocktail which contains vodka and orange juice.

tropical delight - it had orange, pineapple, mango and cream which taste differently. i personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. i would rate 3.8/5.

mint cooler - it is just normal virgin mojito what we gets in other places as well. nothing special was not their. 3.5/5

for starters we ordered lotus stem galouti which was ok ok. the kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5

next we ordered bbq roasted chicken pizza which was good. the pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. but that was covered by the taste. 4/5

overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.

overall - 4.6/5",5,Positive
"the place was in a very high end location. the ambience was not up to the mark. the service seemed pretty hostile when we asked them basic questions. and when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. the appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. we ordered the ""classic mezeh platter"" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response. overall the place is overpriced and the service needs to be improved.",2,Negative
"visited glass onion a month back. the restaurant is very close to office, inside premises of emmar boulder hills. we went with office colleagues on a celebration treat.

ambience was really good. we had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.

food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. we ordered mediterranean platter, bruschetta for vegetarians. the mocktails were nice.

it was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. what really impressed me was that they followed rules. that's really good to see.

for main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. they tasted good. deserts were good but served delayed.

overall nice experience.",4,Positive
"place is cozy, peaceful and beautiful. food is 4.5/5. ambiance 5/5. service 4.5/5. good place to visit with family, friends or team. we tried their special nachos, 5 spice chicken kebab and atishi murg tikka.",5,Positive
"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. the rain today made it even better. outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

thats it to the place and good part!

service was bad, food was ok. if a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. buying water is a choice not force. doesn‚Äôt matter if you are local udipi or a five star. we were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. while leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

we did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. first turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

we ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. we asked for mustard and denied.

the platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. extra chutney took forever to come.

tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

cheesecake was pretty bad. packed to throw i guess. the blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. the creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

they gave a birthday brownie, which frankly was average too. however, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. wtf!!!!!

overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar.",2,Negative
"a classy place with fantastic ambience.the decor was lovely. a perfect place with indoor and outdoor seating options. ordered chicken wings- which were perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavours infused. tempura prawns were okay. can give it a miss. lotus stem galouti kabab- mildly spiced, well cooked and melts in the mouth. ordered chettinad chicken indian tray. it was amazing! sundried tomatoes chicken pasta was made perfectly. ordered goey chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and tiramisu. both of them were perfect.

i can still recall the tempting taste left on my tastebuds while stepped out that night.
must visit!! m definately coming backüòç",5,Positive
"i went there with my office colleagues. the ambience is good. the music played is little loud, may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking.

about food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. what happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.

we ordered lotus stem galouti, the taste of galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. i know it must be an experiment, but i guess it is not working out as it was not going well with galouti.

so, overall, good for one time.",3,Neutral
"i really like this place and i've been there multiple times. the best part is the ambience which is just really classy. you can bring your date here as they have that kind of a romantic ambience. on game nights you can watch live screenings of the matches too. they also have 2+2 on drinks for zomato gold members, which is really nice to have as well.",5,Positive

"talk about a perfect date night and the glass onion is the best decision to go for. with amazing music, perfect view of the golf course, beautiful seating arrangements and sophisticated ambience made the night worth remembering. the new york cheesecake (with blueberry sauce) was good, but i won't deny that i have tasted better cheesecakes before. we ordered one pizza which, was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two. special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter (i apologize i don't remember his name, but he definitely needs some appreciation. i remember he said he was from delhi and also kolkata) who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert. this definitely made our night because it tasted so good. the menu might be little overpriced according to many but for us with smart selection of dishes, it was not a hole in the pocket. overall, it was an outstanding visit. a small suggestion, if they could include candle dining,that would elevate the romantic ambience of the place.",5,Positive

avoid this place in summer due to outside seating. they do not even have coolers in such weather outside and it is an expensive place. not worth,1,Very Negative
"we visited the restaurant yesterday. we got outside table as all insides were reserved. being 42 degrees outside, they only had fans running in such upscale restaurant and mist fans. they are charging 1400 rs for buffet and is considered upscale restaurant. quite amazed on how upscale restaurants cannot afford coolers. felt bad for waiters also as they were fully sweating and running around..i had same experience few months back. we went in th evening and it rained. we took the outside seating due to nice weather plus all the water was gushing inside and they had nothing to prevent that. i liked the food here but if management can't simply think abt service, i am sure we can figure out other places to eat.",2,Negative

the main course was a custom made ravioli pasta in mixed sauce which was very good and a stir fry veg udon noodles.

they can improve on service a bit as no one bothered to serve us food..not even first time!

would like to go back again to enjoy the outdoor ambience next time where they played loud music..but looked like a good place to relax..",4,Positive

we went in a group and tried a lot of things on their menu, everything was unique and best. cocktails were decent. stallion stood out of all!",5,Positive
"i will start off by talking about it's ambience and location which i believe (and am sure most will agree) are it's highlights. located inside the serenity of boulder hills ,away from the hullabaloo of the busy city ,it offers a sense of calm. the simple yet elegant decor , is what clicked for me right from the moment i walked in. it has both and indoor and outdoor sitting. the indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit, i would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer. the streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it , definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink. i visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least. now coming to the food and beverages part, definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all vip locality . the cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu. and yes they have a novel concept of high tea served along with alcoholic beverages , which is served during the early hours of the evening (4-7 pm) , with the set up they have i believe this is a must try. overall it's a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening , with family or friends.

p.s. don't go there looking for dance and high pitch music, you might be disappointed.",4,Positive

"as far as date nights are considered there is music, lovely ambience, tables over looking a golf course and of course some rains to give you respite from the hot summer. this was my dinner night with naina at glass onion, a beautiful restaurant at boulder hills, hyderabad. the best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in hyderabad.
.
let‚Äôs take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates. the beer battered fish was soft and finely fried. lovely textures i must tell. pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza, called four cheese pizza! yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it. a classic wood fired pizza flocks!!
.
the penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables, and i must say i forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in. it was delicious and completely uplifted the mood. we surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya, the stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit, lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic. make sure to use your zomato gold in good use here.
.
the cherry on top was apple pie our parting order, such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce, almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream. we surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find for couples to have a romantic dinner.

there is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. we chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather.

there is quite a large selection of food from italian, continental to indian. we ordered for some starters from which we really like bakchoy fry and also malai broccoli, chilli potato and red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup i would definitely suggest hi for broccoli soup. for the main course we ordered some white sauce pasta, grilled chicken with lemon butter garlic sauce, vegetarian fried rice and my favorite pork spare ribs which was just scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. we also ordered a cheese platter with wine and i would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.

we had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it‚Äôs really not that expensive and it‚Äôs totally worth it for the view and for the food.

"i have been to this place for my birthday dinner date. one of my friend told me about this place. it has a nice view which is worth spending as it is bit overpriced place. if i'll talk about food, its not that great. the portion is also less for the price but if you want a nice place to spend your evening with your loved ones, you can try this place. just go and relax because the food will take time to come..
would have given 3.5...",4,Positive
"so, this place is in boulder hills and is spread across a huge area and the interiors is what one would love to go here for.

the seating arrangement is pretty and comfortable.

we had ordered pizza and vegetable burger which was good in taste. the pizza could be improved a lot though.

we ordered noodles which was good in taste as well.

overall, we had an amazing experience, cheers.",4,Positive
"i visited this place with my ex-roommate after 10 months.
low crowd made us feel even more comfortable.
attractive and romantic ambience..
tasty food and very much reasonable...
good service..
i had chicken breast steaks with mashed potatoes and salad üòã unexpectedly so good taste.
if you are a pasta lover, then do order white sauce pasta.
it tasted incredibly hot and yummy.
as we visited this place for lunch, we had afternoon fizz mocktail with chill coconut and very different flavors of taste.
we wrapped up having sea salt nutella dessert which was heaven of nutella and different taste.
in recent times i've never been to such a good place with decent crowd and tastyyyy food.
i agree that prices are high but i forgot about the price when i had one spoon of food.

do visit this place with your loved ones i bet you will have a perfect date.",4,Positive

"visited the place on a saturday ! we had reservations made for 8pm and reached at around 8:20pm, only to receive a disapproving look by the lady and were told that it is difficult to hold a table this long! the entrance gave a deserted look and we were thinking why is this female so arrogant. thereafter we got to know the real story as we moved towards the seating area. the place was well lit, with a posh ambience, perfect seating and tranquil yet charming environment. really loved the idea of the hanging plants amidst the lights.
we ordered lotus stem galauti kebab, kung paw chicken, teriyaki mushroom. the starters were delicious especially the chicken. beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises.
ordered stir fried udon noodles for main course. although a bit oily, it was tasty, full of vegetables ! the dark brownie ordered as desert was mouth watering, the taste lingers.

the staff is courteous and the vallet very kind and amazing person :)
all in all a good experience !",4,Positive
great food. reasonably priced and situated in good location. had lamb and pasta. quality and quantity was great. we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for the food. people coming for lunch would enjoy the golf course view. a must try for foodies.,5,Positive

we ordered ravioli pasta (which was a show stopper)
nachos, pizza and few of their mocktails.
everything was just perfect , infact i have been to this place earlier and have to say they never disappoint. üëç a big thumbs up. only down vote, for the place being a bit pricy. would rate it as 4.5",4,Positive
"if you are searching for a place with great ambience, golf course view with a pleasent sit out area then this place is a perfect match. we had non veg platter, veg platter , classic chicken burger ( this tasted yum), pathari ghosh, bangok spicy rice bowl non veg ( interesting and a tasty treat) however there are fewer options for veg and menu can be improved.

mocktails very not upto mark and definetly not worth the amount you pay for any of those options as were any other items so please note that its a pricey affair. service was as usual nothing much to be praised about. overall

"it's a must try place in hyderabad. located in boulder hills, this place is spacious and has a golf course in vicinity. the usp of the place is definitely the ambience. the large open area and also the pricey bar counter stacked with expensive liquor. ideal place for a romantic candlelit dinner. the place reverberates the screech of birds at night and the experience is surreal. we ordered pizza and chicken wings and a couple of drinks. food was average but the ambience is mind blowing",4,Positive

"it was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. i reserved a table for us on the same day itself. to start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. i was delighted to see the place at first. contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. the waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. i would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. the starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. i would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. very dissappointing indeed.",1,Very Negative
"when i entered the place i was impressed with the interiors and how huge the place was. what i really liked about the place was that it has a good veg menu as well. we had ordered for a mac n cheese steak. i felt all the items on the plate were dry items be it the grilled vegetables or the patty or the pulao rice, there should‚Äôve been some kind of gravy or dip with these items or else the dish tasted good. we had also ordered for a spaghetti aglio olio. so the spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we didn‚Äôt really like how it tasted. when we informed the management about the spaghetti, they immediately changed it with spinach ravioli. the ravioli tasted really nice, the rich garlic flavour of this dish with pine nuts was a perfect blend.

over all the experience was a really nice. definitely a must visit.",4,Positive
"ambience - 5/5 one of the best in hyderabad, being next to golf course.

"vegetarian review ~

hopped in on a day before holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. survived with food that day. it's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. light music playing through the night was soothing.

we ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, korean waffle fries, veg penne alfredo pasta and apple pie.

lotus stem galouti - the galouti tasted great with the flavours of vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

waffle fries - the waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. the waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

alfredo pasta - the pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

apple pie - this was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

the staff is good and friendly, i remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. keep up the good service. the whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

overall a great place for some drinks and great conversation. ideal for romantic dates and celebrations. the whole embience is calm and peaceful and makes it best among all @theglassonion",4,Positive

"i had heard a lot about glass onion, but came back extremely disappointed. the only reason i've given it 2 stars is because of the nice staff and the gorgeous ambience. the food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. we ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had one piece of lasagna which really shocked me. then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. we gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. we ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the brazilian chocolate cremeux. the chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good. overall, never coming here again and don't recommend to anyone",2,Negative

so every time we go we use zomato zomato code which one of the best option here .but last time when i went they have removed it since the contract is over .

"i recently visited here for lunch with my office team mates . the food was really good, and the staff were polite and quick to respond. the ambience was pretty pleasing too.

one issue with this place is that the parking area is really really cramped. it is small, and since it is shared with the other eateries in the same building, parking your car can be a bit of a headache here.",4,Positive

"this place is gold if you want a good dining experience in financial district. amid all the star hotels and big names, this place has made its mark. it is not cheap but thats fine, considering the portions they serve and taste. you will be done with one burger or a rice/roti with a curry. zomato gold comes to your rescue if you have one. i like simple chicken burger and lemonade. burger come with some potato wedges, salad.",5,Positive
"deli9 has a lots of good food to offer and that's why i flock the place pretty frequently. my favorite here is their pan fried fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. it was dry and chewy sadly. their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). if you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (i like the creamy and balanced kind). if you like mocktails, i would suggest that you leave out the ginger lime fizz. it's a poor version of our limca. the mojitos here are pretty refreshing though.",4,Positive

not willing to visit again..( would give 2.5 if had a choice)",3,Neutral
this is a good place to dine. the food is really good. although there's not so much that you can order. the ambience is really nice. just giving 5 star because me and my friends just love the aloo 65 pulav.,5,Positive
"been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. my all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. it is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. i would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. their pizzas are also taste worthy. despite being a non-vegetarian, i really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. 

besides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.

highly recommended if you are in the area near wipro circle gachibowli.

have visited deli 9 many times with good experiences but this particular time didn‚Äôt have the same. i ordered singaporean prawns for starters. as i was using zomato gold the waiter insisted a place orders for both the dishes together which i haven‚Äôt heard anywhere before. after some question the waiter agreed. the quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good. then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee. overall the service disappointed me but its a good shot for some good food,3,Neutral

this place has an nice warm ambience. as their tower burger isn't available we have ordered chicken burger along with lamb pizza and lasagne. the burger was amazing the patty was so juicy and was perfect. the pizza was also good. the lasagne was a tad bit disappointing as it was felt grainy in the mouth but tasted delicious. the service was very prompt. would love to visit this place again.",4,Positive
"more is not always merrier, hot dog with lettuce and tomatoes was tasting more like a sub sandwich, although after removing the veggies it tasted really nice.

home style potato wedges were a good attempt but a little too bland.

penne pasta was overcooked but the sauce had not soaked in all flavours hence tasted a undercooked.

best part was the desert, old fashioned pastry which was not too sweet and not too chocolate.

overall experience was goodsince the staff is very considerate and ambience is very comforting",3,Neutral
"deli 9 bistro is in front of holiday inn express and suites hence becomes a perfect fit to order some dinner.

veggie 9 burger - 3.5/5
deli 9 bistro garden pizza -4.5/5
shawarma wrap - 3/5

pizza was very good .it was a thin crust pizza with cheese,sauces and veggies on top of it.
burger had a patty with cheese and some vegetables like cucumber,tomatoes and onions.i found the burger pretty average.

with both burger and wrap,they give some wedges and salad complementary.when i ordered then as well as when i went to their restaurant,the wedges were cold and dry and they were disgusting.i can understand if it was only in the case when i ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedges.that was seriously not expected from deli 9 bistro!!!",3,Neutral

we have been looking for a place like this near our office from quite a long and usually had to compromise with some ok places for lunch, but if you are also working around this place then deli 9 bistro is a place which will serve you variety of food options with satisfied palate.

the ambiance of this place is pretty nice, a place to have a conversation with your meal.

the staff is polite and friendly and very professional.

"wonderful restaurant! absolutely fabulous food!

ambience: very nice and comfy... doesn't feel rushed which is particularly important for this kind of place.

food: every morsel is heavenly! they nailed both veg and non veg dishes which is a rarity in itself... loved the pizzas, the fish and chips is a must order, the penne alfredo is pretty good too... as is the spicy crispy chicken leg dish.... absolutely delicious! mushroom soup was very nice too.... minestrone was average.... couldn't try the desserts because there's only so much a person can have lol...

p.s. - they do have a bar but no bira.

service - polite. but you must be patient. food preparation takes time. if you reach post 9:30pm, you will be expected to order your entire meal in one shot itself.

"this is one of the poor italian restaurants in hyderabad. the first giveaway was the menu cards. they were all torn and faded. few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places.
the chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained.

coming to the food, i can say that it was very disappointing. we had ordered -
‚Ä¢chicken wings
‚Ä¢tangy arrabita pasta
‚Ä¢farmer's ortalano
‚Ä¢tiramisu

‚ñ™Ô∏éthe chicken wings were marketed as a spicy dish but the spice was no where to be felt. also, the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same - sweet and heavy.
‚ñ™Ô∏éthe red sauce of the pasta was diluted .it was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta.
‚ñ™Ô∏éthe pizza was the first relief, though it wasn't as it as some of the other restaurants. it was thin and it retained its shape.
‚ñ™Ô∏éthe tiramisu was a disaster. the cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour. we had to send it back.

finally, the service. the service was one of the very few worthwhile experience.

all in all, i will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone.",2,Negative

coming to main topic the food pizza was great but it was a mixed feel for pork ribs as i always like my meat to be spicy but the barbequed sauce was little sweet not to my liking.

"frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet, interesting evening conversation.
the music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud. it moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space.
service was fine. we had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.
here is what we ordered:
100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. creamy and not too sugary.
dark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. it tastes exactly as you would want it to. the only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but i guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.
chicken ala plancha - sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. it was as ordinary as ordinary can be. we ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. it's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. wouldn't recommend.
lamb ravioli - it's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). to our delight, frio doesn't disappoint here. the ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.
we couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but i have heard that their tiramisu is great.
all in all, frio is a good place to visit. in terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. i won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either. happy dining!",3,Neutral

the packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. no spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

i really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. however, there is scope for improvement because i've read good things about this place and their food. didn't expect it to be like this.",3,Neutral

the food was a big disappointment though. of all the dishes we ordered, few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace. main course (spinach ravioli, belly dance pizza, stuffed chicken breast and greek chicken sovlakhi) was a total disaster. not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch. we finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake, which was good and filling.

overall, an average restaurant. if you‚Äôre looking for good italian, this is not the place to be. cibo house is.",3,Neutral
the coffee at this place was one of the i ever had ... a small cozy place with good food is something everyone needs to tackle a hectic week or take a break from the everyday stress... the broccoli with cheese and aglio olio are a must have . if you are a coffee lover it's a must try.,4,Positive

"this place is my go to place for continental food at gachibowli. the food is absolutely awesome. my recommendations would be doner kebab, any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs.

the doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus.

in pizza, i love the pigs over a blanket pizza. the pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here.

in mains, the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside.

in desserts i loved all their creations from the baklava, to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu...

the service is quick and the staff is courteous.",5,Positive

"i had very high expectations from this one. but disappointed. talking about food , the taste was below average. we ordered pasta and pizzas both were not at all good. the only thing which i liked about this place is the ambience. it's very decent. coming to service, the waiters were very humble but our order took more than 1 hour to reach us to the table. overall below average experience . üòê",2,Negative
5 stars for the ambience--the place is super cosy and makes you feel at ease. i didn't feel like leaving! i'm a vegetarian so the veg food was pretty good. the garlic bread was otherworldly! üëåüèΩ overall the place is a little pricey but still worth it.,4,Positive

"it was a late sunday evening and we decided to go to frio after pulling each others hair for an hour. had to call in as the restaurant was about to close in 10 minutes. they were gracious enough to take our order and also served us well. the food was good, it was almost there both the pasta and the risotto. we had the curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli. chicken was a used scarcely maybe that was a put down for me because i am a meat lover. the pasta though was perfect, spicy just like i want and the penne was well cooked. thanks for taking us in frio on a cold sunday night. we will be back.",4,Positive
"well if atall i am in gachibowli area in lunch times or dinner times...my mind like a magnet asks me to get into this cozy bistro. each thin slices of pizza wid toppings of olive oil and chilli flakes is all you need for your mid day motivation.
have been to this place couple of times and everytime tried something new in veg. but pizza has been a constant one. the spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. these two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
a friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
i have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
tough i did claim the money back as i feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
zomato gold is always an add on benifit .
every time i go to this place...i come out happy tummy n happy soul ..",5,Positive
good place to visit and the ambiance was awesome. best place to hangout with friends. food was yummy the starters were good. the overall experience was awesome.,4,Positive

tiramisu and chocolate dessert best in the area",4,Positive
"been to this place last month. quite a peaceful place not many people were there. we ordered some drinks and pizza and pasta. i somehow felt pizza could have been little better the taste was good and it was cooked properly. but there were literally no toppings except chicken. pasta was clearly not upto the mark. i had given specific instructions which weren't taken care at all. also, later during the billing there were some confusions on the gold membership. we did inform the staff at tge beginning that we have zomato gold however not sure if that was well communicated to the management, because during the billing we were said that we should have informed about the gold membership earlier which we clearly did. but didn't quite understood whats the problem if it is not communicated at the beginning.. do they charge differently for the gold membership people because they have offers??",3,Neutral
"food was okay overall but the mocktail wasn't much. tried chef's special fish but was not upto mark by a single iota. the ambience was definitely a big plus though, with a nice view of the cityscape. the service experience was also pleasant.",4,Positive
"this place was on my list for a long time.
decided to check it out and was badly disappointed.

the mild mushroom soup was too bland and they don't serve a 1/2 of the soup. you will have to order 2 soups instead.

the red rooster pizza just didn't have any taste to it.
gachibowli fried chicken was a disaster.

stuffed grilled chicken breast was the only face saver at this place.

the regular water they served had dust floating on it, had to get bottled water.

would never go to this place again. won't recommend to anyone either.

the prices are on the higher side and they are just not worth it.",1,Very Negative
very unprofessional staffs!! don‚Äôt even know how to serve the food on request!! whatever you will ask their 1st answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù. they also do have communication issues. very disappointing!!,1,Very Negative
"we went to frio bistro on a lazy sunday evening. it‚Äôs easy to find and a cozy place right on the main road. the portions are all made for one person only but are very filling. we had the alfredo pasta and it was hands down one of the best pastas i‚Äôve had in the city. the starters are good and filling. the mocktails are fun tasty drinks.
what we had: tomato and olive bruschetta (highly recommended), chilli cheese rolls, spinach and corn cheese ravioli, artichoke and baby corn a la plancha, cranberry kiss (highly recommended) and mojito.
ambience- 4/5
food- 4.5/5
cost efficiency- 4/5 (could have been higher, but zomato gold is a saviour)",4,Positive
"good food, nice ambience and quick service. we ordered, veg pasta, which was very good, pizza, above average taste, and cheese rolls - super cheesy and crispy. we like the food. the cold coffee was also quite good there. :)",4,Positive
"the place had an amazing smell of bathroom pee when we entered. hillariously the manager seemed barely aware of this horrible stench and promised to spray.

the lamb pizza which i suspect used the same sauce as the kheema was good but too salty likely cus it's meant to be eaten with spaghetti. the mezze platter is enough for one person barely. it's literally a single plate filled with 3 dips and 6 breads the size of a palm without fingers.

the desserts is where this place shines. they apparently think tiramisu is a soggy cake..? that fondant cake should taste still of maida because they didn't understand the concept and that managers should barely give a shit or apologize.

don't go its bad.",2,Negative
this is a great place to have good food with an okaish ambience. me and my friends went there for lunch. i ordered stuffed chicken breast from the chef's special coloum. the dish was great and also looked very nutritious. i would recommend this place. give it a try you may like it :),4,Positive

"really good food, friendly staff. the pork ribs are a must try. the food was well cooked, very well presented and the menu had a lot of interesting dishes.",5,Positive
somedays it's decent but somedays it's so not good. yesterday we ordered fish paella and the rice was tasteless just dipped in chilli water. i love spicy food but not like this. we also ordered lamb bolognese and for both dishes it looks like they recycled the same generic masala mixture. it was so pungent.,2,Negative
the place is not too huge or classy but it is good enough to have a nice peaceful meal. went for dinner and ordered a pizza and arabiata pasta(both veg). pizza was thin crust and it was one of the best crust i had in a while. if you like the original taste of tomato then this pasta is for you as it retained that taste.,5,Positive
"interesting menu, backed up by execution. a variety of continental cuisines tried, one of the first places i have seen try a spanish paella in hyderabad. good value too",4,Positive
i was here with my pals for a lunch. we have tried a pizza and ravioli here which was so good. the whole review will be updated soon. the place has a good ambience,4,Positive
"i would rate it 3-4 star. it is a mediocre restaurant with different cuisine.
food was ok. first was minestrone soup, it did not have any exotic vegetables or pasta. tangy taste was good. mezze platter was average.humus was good while pita bread was not upto the mark. thin crust pizza farmers orelanto was good. had nice crust. among deserts, ordered for chocolate fondant, it was the best with right amount of sweetness.
presentation of each and every dish was superb. staff is polite. good place for quiet dinner. can improve on food taste though.",3,Neutral

zomato gold applied so got good discount
veg start can have more choices",5,Positive
good food but not very friendly customer service. the servers were way unfriendly. overall average experience. would request management to improve the quality of staff serving the food. their attitude needs to improve.,2,Negative
"the place has a nice quiet ambience, i was surprised that it wasn't crowded as you'd expect a top place to be on a weekend.

we were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place, the place had a nice charm to it . we ordered the tangy grilled mushrooms and the glazed pork ribs, but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order. we came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly, when i checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10:15pm.

coming to food, the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that's probably my palate , the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender. had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too.

the waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm. not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don't actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food, it just doesn't leave a good experience, possibly the restaurant and it's employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way.

the rating is for the food and the place in general.service is a bare minimum.",3,Neutral

"a sophisticated and calm place to eat. i'm a big fan of their stuffed cheese steak (chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach, served with mashed potatoes and veggies). the sangria was not up to the mark and the chocolate shake was also average. i would definitely go there for their pastas and the stuffed steak.",3,Neutral
we ordered spinach and cheese cream ravioli and spicy tomoto pastas. spinach and cheese cream ravioli was delicious but i expected it to be white sause pasta and it was red sauce pasta. pit master oizza was good. cheese lovers was not so good it was thin crust and taste was awful.overall it was overpriced and taste was not very great but ok ok,3,Neutral
"i really had high expectations for frio bistro. it'd been on my to-eat list for a while. the food is average. we had a pasta, the chicken & sausage paella, and a cheesecake. nothing was really sooo yummy/out of the world. and it was really costly. but the staff was courteous. however, i probably won't come here again",3,Neutral

"just be careful ordering here, they mix up vegetarian and non vegetarian food. it's a good chance that you get served a non vegetarian dish instead of veg version of the same. staff is a bit clueless (lazy service). overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes. nothing great or distinctive. this review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time.",1,Very Negative

"the ambience is excellent , the food not so much , we ordered a half n half pizza , margarita & bbq chicken , the pizza was not up to the mark , now for the second dish we had ordered was alfredo chicken pasta , the pasta sauce was very liquidish , chicken was undercooked. i am have visited this restaurant before & it was an awesome experience , we used zomato good during this visit of ours , not sure if this has anything to do with the food taste , there were 2 pizza slices left & the the restaurant said they will not pack the leftover food as they said it was orders / rules from zomato , they said they would rather throw the left over in the dustbin but not give it to the customer , this is very strange rules , zomato relook at your guidelines",2,Negative
"frio bistro is a fine-dining restaurant with classy interiors which was painted full of black color which brings the elagance to the place. the bar set-up was small,quirky & the inverted glasses tied up with the ceiling made it look beautiful. this place offers italian,indian & continental as well.
.
i visited this place yesterday for a quick lunch & ordered two main course dishes. the first dish was belly dance pizza which is a 12"" thin crust pizza topped with arabian shawarma peices,capsicum which had that earthy flavor in it . the chicken pieces were juicy & tender. the whole pizza tasted delicious with it's toppings. the other dish we ordered was spinach & cream cheese ravioli. pasta was hand -made by the chef added with italian styled tomato salsa & fresh parmesan cheese . ravioli was stuffed with spinach which wasn't up to the mark. after having pasta, i felt like i should have ordered the white -sauce variant.

"was here with my colleagues. the service was excellent. vegetarian food was good. my colleagues liked the non-veg dishes a lot. ambience is decent.
would visit them again to try more options in veg.",4,Positive
"so, we decided to have some grub on a monday afternoon and dashed off to frio bistro for no particular reason. there were not many customers around and that definitely helped us get some attention but the service was ok. we carefully curated our order - chimichuri pan fried fish, lamb ravioli and andhra pepper chicken pizza. i must say the food tasted authentic and delicious.

chimichuri pan fried fish, the chef's special, came with fish boasting a tangy and spicy herb crust, salsa, sauteed spinach and scallion rice. it was easily the best dish we ordered. the lamb ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein. then came the spicy andhra pepper chicken pizza. it generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then.

all in all, the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit.

made another visit and uploading some pictures.

"have been for lunch. honestly speaking had a good expectations, but not really did the food satisfy my taste buds.

soup ""rustic itallian minestrone"" was a good start to begin with. assuming something different it will be ordered ""gacchibowli fried chicken"", only to realise it was another version of kfc friend chicken. this was little disappointing. and in main course ""stuffed chicken breast"" was descent and not so out of the world taste but it's ok.

all in all descent ambience, ok food but service has to be improved a lot. for me for sure not a second time visit place, rest you can do try for sure you may be lucky and fortunate to get better taste of food.",3,Neutral

"frio bistro is a little quaint place tucked away somewhere in the crowded area of gachibowli.
the decor was very pretty and the place looked very cosy.
we had non-veg pizza and chicken wings for starters. both were equally good. the highlight of our meal was pork ribs which was served with veggies and mashed potato. the pork was soft and succulent and melted instantly in our mouth. one could easily say that was prime moment of our dine at frio bistro.
desserts were good as well, but could have been better.
overall, it‚Äôs a nice place to visit if you want to have a comfortable meal in the midst of the hustle bustle of this city.
would definitely go back to this joint for their amazing pork ribs!",4,Positive
"food was good. service was great. the staff is super courteous. but the food didn't really make me go wow this is amazing. it was good, but then again, not out of this world. it's a great place to hang out. we had the bacon pizza, alfredo pasta, and the prawn and fish paella. on a visit before that we had the mushroom risotto. the mushroom risotto was great! the bacon pizza can have a bit more of the pizza sauce on it. i didn't like the taste of the raw red pepper in the paella. finished with hot chocolate which was amazing. looking forward to trying a few other dishes there on the next visit.",3,Neutral

"i wish i could give it a 3.5 but don't have the option. just for the record it deserves a strong 3 (closer to a 4).

we tried the pizza, chicken breast stuffed with spinach, spaghetti followed by deserts.

the turkish pizza was the stand out dish for us (we did not expect that). the others were also very good and i would go again for sure.

the tiramisu, although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down. the bakhlava was just okay, not a bad attempt. the cheese cake on the other hand was yumm...

overall, i would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side. we ended up paying about a 1200 per head ...",3,Neutral
"had a family lunch while on a visit to hyderabad. suggested by my son settled for the meal.

we went with the suggestion of the steward, for starters had mushroom on khari, turned out to be a good choice.
son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket. he was okay.

spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. when we informed the steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.

finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu. a bigger disappointment.",3,Neutral

"this place has a really aesthetic ambiance starting from the vintage design to the 60-70s music that plays in the background.
we ordered the famous irani chai with a bunch of onion samosa, fries and a pasta sandwich.

this place serves one of the best irani chai that i have had in hyderabad. the onion samosa takes me back to my childhood days when we used to buy them at small shops for a rupee or so. they tasted amazing here. i wouldn't recommend getting the chai ir samosa delivered at all. kills the taste completely. these needs to be had hot and getting it delivered will definitely disappoint.

talking about the fries, i wouldn't say they were amazing but they sure weren't bad. we did not like the pasta sandwich. this item wouldn't be something that i would recommend.

this place would remain one of my favorite spots to hangout at.

(could be a little cleaner though)",4,Positive
"one of the worst services i would have ever come across. there were two incidents at the same cafe and the feedback given to them was not even reviewed.
the first time, i ordered an irani chai and it took them 1hour to serve and it was one first chais ever consumed. it was served in a broken glass. very disappointed.

the second time, my female friend wanted to use the washroom but it was extremely dirty and smelling.


it‚Äôs sad to see such disappointment from a brand like karachi.",2,Negative
"want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you‚Äôre at it , munch on some delicious food? karachi cafe , gachibowli is the place for you!
food:
‚Ä¢peri peri chicken- this dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,garlic bread and saut√©ed vegetables.
the chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.
‚Ä¢chicken pesto sandwich- the sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. it has very light taste and perfect meal for two on hot summer day.
‚Ä¢bun maska- literally the best buns you could get your hands on! filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it‚Äôs literally addictive!

beverages:
‚Ä¢cold coffee- the beverage wasn‚Äôt cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. would not recommend this drink.
‚Ä¢irani chai- generally irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn‚Äôt very sugary. it had a mild yet tempting taste . would definitely recommend.

ambience: every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty. perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family.",4,Positive
"staffs are very polite, friendly and understand customer's problem like i was unable to eat continental in the plate that they have served but they noticed and served extra plate before i ask them for.
ambiance of cafe is very nice, full of old stuff, photographs and plants as well.
u can also put the plant on your table.
food is good and quantity is more than enough.

this place became one of my fav. very frequently i started visiting this place.
i think you people should give a try, will be in love with the plants , stuff, food, ambiance.",5,Positive
"featuring an interesting place on the busy streets of gachibowli.
karachi cafe
location: near chocolate room,old bombay highway,gachibowli
been here for an hour and my observations went like the below.
food:
food tastes classic karachi types and the prices are high.
had a bombay roasted sandwich and dum ki chai.
bombay roasted sandwich
price:inr 150
taste:4.5/5
dum ki chai
price: inr 55
taste:4.5/5
the sandwich gave me a classic bombay vadapav taste and was baked and roasted well.
the dum ki chai was to the next level of irani chai and ultimately said to be well
ambience:
ambience is a classic karachi ambience where all the walls are filled with posters of 19th centuary movies and the classic advertisements of beverages.

overall rating :4/5
price:3/5
taste:4.5/5
ambience:4/5",4,Positive
the food was okay. the ambience was good but the waiter's behavior was not good. a zomato guy came to receive an order he asked for a glass of water and they denied him and told him to wait outside.,2,Negative
"been to this place a few months back. i must say, it has a very aesthetically pleasing decor. both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement is available. it is also pretty easy to locate.

the items we ordered were barbeque mushroom sandwich, spaghetti in alfredo sauce with vegetables, apple pie with vanilla ice cream, irani chai and filter kapi. apart from the apple pie, all the items were really tasty. the pie's crust was a bit too thick. rest, everything was worth every single penny. i would love to visit this place again.

quantity: 4.5/5

value for money: 4.5/5

i also happened to order their exotic vegetable pizza through zomato. i found the price quite reasonable. the best part was the sauce with a desi twist.

karachi caf√©, with a variety of food and beverage items and an amazing ambience, is a really cool place to hangout.",4,Positive
very bad service. i had to askfor a glass of water 5 times. one waiter passes the message to another and the other one doesn‚Äôt care!!!! horrible service. i m never going back there.,1,Very Negative
"this place has a eye catching ambience. a small cafe that is best for a quick meeting, short break etc. i tried the pasta that was a bit spicy but good in taste.",4,Positive
"it's a very mind soothing place, you may find out childhood stuffs. a aroma of 80's are all around. a great place to hang out for friends and couples. food prices are not beyond limit.",4,Positive
"looking for a cute place for a date and chai, then it is among my top 5. loved their pasta and the jam roll was wow. can't wait to go there again.",5,Positive
"man! who the hell are giving such high ratings to such useless cafes? yesterday i went to one cafe seeing a 4+ zomato rating, and it was horrible. today i went here and it even exceeded that other cafe today in terms of pure pathetic-ness of the cafe. the service is so rude, slow and pathetic that you wonder how bad would it be to make it self service. the food is bad and certainly not worth such high prices. and the guys are least bothered to tell you by the time that you ask for bill that one of the drinks you ordered isn't available; let alone bring drinks along with the food. i don't know how these inflated ratings in hyderabad is working, but in my hometown, a place like this would hardly touch 2 stars rating on zomato.",1,Very Negative
"i really wish i could finish off the review in a word, but yeah, zomato is not letting me to that! if you guys want to have irani chai, i guess this is the place. and omg, that onion samosa? before getting there, do you guys remember the small triangle shaped samosa we would all go ga-ga for? yes. they have it! you don't need to go street to street searching for them. they have it right here. so one plate samosa, irani chai and osmania biscuits. you hit cloud nine! oh i forgot, this is for you guys! to the guys who are living alone far away from your own home without your mamma and pappa, you'd definitely wanna hit this place listening to 'mere sapno ke rani kab..'. yea. only kishore kumar ! and the place. let's just say, it's all vintage!
ambience, food chai, music, cleanliness- 5/5 ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,Positive

"recently visited this place.
food-4/5
ambience-4.5/5
service -4/5
this place has amazing interior and a cafe without good interior is not worth to go to. it has rustic feel.
the food is really good. amazing north indian, mughlai food they serve here. service was okayish",4,Positive
"this restaurant deserves a special mention for their superbly amazing keema pav!! i usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants (i prefer home-made), but the keema pav served here reminded me of home - it's that good! we had even ordered for baida roti - which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it. (by the way, their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for!) suleimaani chaai also deserves a special mention, it was so good that we ordered it twice.
the ambience is also so good! they had these old ad posters put up on their walls - it really reminded me of those old parsi restaurants in mumbai.",5,Positive
"love the ambience, has a rustic feel to it. i recommend the chai and their baked goods. the service is good and everything is reasonably priced.",5,Positive
"the ambience literally brings you the vintage feels. the service of this place is brilliant.
when i visited this place firstly i had ordered for some bun maska and sulaimani chai, really liked it. i also had the chicken kabiraji, personally i felt it could have been slightly better.",4,Positive

irani chai was made to perfection. i got a strong, sweet and milky tea in one chai glass.

service was great!",5,Positive
"dishes tried: keema pav, baida roti

the food is pretty good. i mean i have tasted better keema pav but this also good, notbhrrst but good. baida roti was pretty interesting taste.

the staff was very welcoming. ambience is pretty great.",5,Positive
"went to the place not expecting much. the menu threw me off as most of it seemed overpriced. we ordered irani chai and mawa cup cake to begin with. both of these were really good! we followed that up with barbecue mushroom and club chicken sandwich. the sandwich was filling and very delicious. we topped it off with another round of irani chai. the place has an old worldly feel about it with old posters, transistor, old tv etc yo take you to the good old times. also, old bollywood songs add to the charm. great place to have a cup of tea and snacks!",4,Positive
"looking for a nice evening chai and something to go with it , this can be one really good option. located in gachibowli just off the main raod it's a nice small cafe.

the interiors give you a feeling of a hangout place for the millennials , to just come, sit, relax , have tea and just engage in hearty conversation. if you have a office in financial district one can take out probably an hour and can visit the place.

i would definitely recommend some of the items
tea - i am a tea lover and hence can never get over this
keema pav - good
irani onion samosa - definitely recommend
bun maska - dip it in tea and enjoy

overall a nice place can be visited at leasure

ambiance 4
value for money 4",4,Positive
"had veg puff here a number of times but this karachi cafe never disappointed.
everything is fresh and tasty but the only downside is that the sandwiches and burgers are just reheated and served.
a few of the menu items are available only from afternoon and get over pretty quickly so i usually call them up to check before i visit this place.",4,Positive
"a vintage themed cafe by the legendry karachi bakery with a soothing ambience, having some posters, advertisement, old movie scenes hanging up framed on the wall. liked the old time television, telephone, sound tape which are also an add on to the decor. the food variety they offer is something that can be related to quick bites. had dum ki chai and it was soo refreshing one. could be compared with "" kadak chai"".
a visit may uplift your mood ! :)
overall good experience.",4,Positive
"this retro themed cafe was cozy where u can get lost reading ur fav book at the corner table indulging in retro music..!! u can‚Äôt help but shake a leg
the famous irani chai with thr richness of milk is all u need for a gloomy day

don‚Äôt try the items marked as must try (they are actually the ones that doesn‚Äôt taste good ü§£)
on a sweet note u must try their victoria cake slice & blueberry cheese cake",4,Positive
"i had a really bad experience in karachi cafe. i have visited this place with a lot of hope as the rating and the review are really good. ordered only ginger tea, irani tea, osmania biscuits but unfortunately we did not like anything they offered.

even the tea was not good and the pricing is really high and i am not ok with paying rs. 75 for a bad cup of tea.

sorry folks. you guys need to improve.",2,Negative

but i didnt like the food over there, it was average. i even ordered ferrero rocher shake and would rate it 2/5.",2,Negative

"this was the first place i visited after reaching hyderabad... located off the main road in gachibowli, this place serves delectable food... the ambience gives a feeling of retro space with the decor mostly consisting of retro themed wall hangings...

we tried the keema pav, paneer tikka sub and macaroni sandwich... the service was on the slower side... the food took around 30mins to reach our table... keema pav was simply awesome... the keema was nicely done... it was quite flavorful... the macaroni sandwich and till sub was also good but have had better in the past... we were also served for fruit biscuits which was again simply delicious...

overall a good place to have some snacks and chat...",4,Positive

"i tried their ginger tea, some cookies and apple pie. and i loved all of them. the price is definitely high for tea but so is the quantity. the picture is showing one by two of one ginger tea. üòÖ",4,Positive
"the visit to this place was something on my mind for a long time. this was rated highly on zomato and was recommended by a number of my contacts, so decided to give it a shot on a friday night with the 'homeminister'. 
we came in late but the place was still lively. on entering, you definitely notice the ambiance which is a bit idyllic and retro. with the 70s and the 80s song playing in the background, you definitely feel like going back in some time. 

we settled in and ordered fries, keema pav, and chicken farcha. to gulp it all down we ordered the irani chai. 

boy o boy we were in for a treat. all the dishes were simply delicious and mouthwatering. their keema pav is true to its name and fame, amazing. the chicken farcha was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. all the dishes were served piping hot which enhanced the taste.

service was a bit slow but it could be understood as the meals were served hot. though the place is small, it can comfortably sit a good amount of people with seating outside as well. slightly on the pricier side, we still felt it was worth it given the quantity. with the trusted name of karachi sweets as the backers, you can definitely count on the quality. 

ambiance - 4/5
service - 5/5
food - 5/5
value for money - 4/5",4,Positive
i was introduced to this brand in airport. then came across their biscuits in spencers. so when in hyderabad how could i miss visiting karachi bakery. this outlet was near my temporary residing place.. i like their cookies a lot but i have fallen in love with their chocolates.. the sugar free ones are also yumm.,4.5,Positive
"i have ordered red velvet cake once. they asked to change the order as red velvet was not available. so, i asked the available list of cake and on that list i ordered chocolate cheesecake. after 50 min of waiting they again call me and told that cheesecake is not available. what kind of behavior is this. never order from here",1,Very Negative
"this place is lost in the row of cafes and restaurants in gachibowli. cute little cafe with vintage indian vibes, having posters of old hindi movies and early air india adorning their wall. can be a good spot for a casual date or a catch up. we ordered an irani chai and nankatai. both of them were yum!",4,Positive

"i'm obsessed with the irani chai at karachi cafe. the first time i had irani chai was here and i fell in love with the place. my friend and i come here once in a while to catch up and we just love this cafe. it's so cute, quiet, and very pretty. i love the theme. i'm not really sure how the food is. we've had their mawa cake which goes great with the chai and the paneer sub which wasn't that great. but nonetheless, it's one of my favorite places.",4,Positive

"starting off i was amazed by the looks and ambience of the place from the side of the road ! so i was anticipating it !

on a sunny sunday morning i convinced my friends to come down here !

the ambience and the themed decorations was fascinating and how they maintained it so well and beautifully
the kettle shaped water jug and the bulb shaped salt containers the rough and old furniture look and the old bollywood movie dialogue and old popular brands ! all of it put together was so so appealing to me !
the old big radio and the dial up telephones brought back so many childhood memories !

coming to what we ordered

bbq chicken sub
chicken 65 sub
omlette sandwich
crispy chicken burgers
apple pie with vanilla ice cream

the first thing that as lovely about each of these(except apple pie of course) that they were whole some and there were generous amount of french fries t and wedges to go along with the mains !

i had the burger and it was damn fulfilling
crispy square chicken patties and layered with veggies and lettuce, it was really nice! however to be critical it could have done with more cheese or mayonnaise !

the subs were spicy and had substantial chicken pieces and the omlette sandwich was pretty decent too !
overall i felt the pocket pinch was quite normal for a cafe ! at least the food satisfied our appetite !

p.s. - they took their theme very seriously and that shows when you enter the washroom !
you'll find a old rexona ad in a frame !

all in all the place seemed perfect for all occasions for a romantic date or getaway
for a group outing for people who love ambience and for random tea meet ups as well !

must visit !! üòöüòçüòçüòçüòé",5,Positive
"yesterday it was a good evening we spent at karachi cafe along with the entire team. it's a very decent place for discussion, eating or for a date.

we ordered various things like samosas, chicken kobirazi, veg cutlet, paneer kathi roll, macaroni sandwich, veg grilled sandwich etc. all the items were very good and pretty tasty. the irani chai was fabulous.

it's a place with the theme old is gold, so you can see pictures from the past hanging on the walls.
all of you can try out this place as it's located very near to it offices.
service was good, cost wise also it's not very high. would like to taste some more items from the menu.",4,Positive

a 19th century themed caf√© which has a soothing ambiance, it will remind some of you of your childhood. posters, advertisements, scenes from the past are framed and put up all over the 4 walls. the food is is amazing, i went for the pink penne grilled chicken pasta and we couldn't resist finishing it even though we were half full. lemon tea (barfeilly chai) is a refreshing mix.
must visit as this place will definitely uplift your mood.",5,Positive
"had pizza at near by pizza hut and badly wanted to have a dessert, so randomly choose this place to have dessert. we‚Äôve ordered victoria cake slice and old fashion chocolate cake, and we deeply liked them both. interior theme should be mentioned here specially, its rustic, antique and has a distinctive style to it. must try place",4,Positive

fine biscuit, irani chai and roohafza are my favourites here.",4,Positive
went there with a friend on a weekday evening. ordered bbq chicken and nizami roll. the chicken in both dishes did not taste good and was not fresh. irani chai was not up to the mark. cost wise its on the higher side and not worth it. overall a bad experience.,2,Negative

ambience looked classic with those vintage vibes.

"lovely decor. the service is slow. but the staff are good. love the menu here. pocket friendly prices.
we tried out the chicken kabiraji, bbq chicken sub, paneer chicken sub and the nizami khati roll.
loved the taste. the quantity was perfect too.",4,Positive
"it was a payday and was looking for pocket friendly restaurant in indira nagar area when we encountered karachi cafe!! as you enter the restaurant you time travel to 80s-90s era. the wall paint, bit rugged, and the walls decorated with movie posters and advertisements of the bygone era. to submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set, radio and a landline with round dialling pad, milk cans, kettle, glass jars, and of course the attire of the waiters!! the old melodies make you just go wow!!

coming to the food, we ordered chicken kabiraji and macaroni pink grilled chicken pasta!!
let's discuss each in an order.

chicken kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg!!!

next delicacy, macaroni pink grilled chicken pasta. remotely similar taste of pasta which i experienced was a long time back. the blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless. the quantity was great for two.

i would suggest to visit this place with good hopes and do try other items on the list!!

we were two of us, and we ordered so much. irani chai, bombay khari, fruit nankhatai, maska bun, keema pav, rice-veg-khuchamber raita combo, and a sweet lime juice. everything tastes delicious!

if you love savouring snacks from the old city with a cup of tea, this is the place to be. though there are places which give you a better taste for the same things in the menu, they don't offer the ambience of this cafe.

juices to coffee, they‚Äôve got everything you need. all this without burning a hole in your pocket.

in picture:

i had ordered their nutella pancakes and coffee: the packaging was perfect and the nutella was well smothered. the coffee hadn‚Äôt leaked either.

me being a healthy food eating person, instructions of using less oil and less chilli were correctly taken into account by the restaurant and the taste also was great.

quality and quantity were both quite satisfying. great job.üëåüèªüëçüèª

one suggestion from my side will be to add calories, ingredients and nutritients information (for ex: protein, fat, carbs content; micro nutrients information) for each dish being offered. this will be very helpful for everyone especially for people like me who want to eat clean and healthy.",4,Positive

tells you blatantly that your order will take time (more than 40 mins before i placed the order). i checked in at 8 40 am!
ambience is a great miss for sure. super duper uncomfortable seats.
add:
the pancakes are very average. could be more fluffy.
they did not have waffles, so i can't tell.
eggs: shambles not scrambled. over salty in places. no salt in rest of the place. why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs.
tea: the only reason i beimg kind and can say 2.5 is tea. lovely tea. quite a hassle btw for just tea though üòÇ",2,Negative
"i had ordered 2 varieties of shawarma. the order reached on time. the packaging was good and the shawarmas itself were hot, creamy and delicious. it was wrapped in foil paper and quantity was sufficient wrt price. i used the 50%off coupon from zomato. i recommend this place.

1. shawarma
2. colddrink
3. waffle+ ice-cream for the frst time and secomd time i onlu ordered chicken shwrma.

what a treat it was to look at the packaging taste and everything was so good.i am quitd impressed by their service. they need to work on just one thing.

"a good place to have value for money food , the staff is quick to respond and polite , what i didn't like was the hygiene as some kind of foul smell was in the restaurant also the lights are not up to the mark which needs to be improved and the temperature inside was kind of hot even in winter.

when it comes to food it is very good with good cost and tasty , we had desi shawarma , peri peri and chilli garlic shawarma regular size , all of them were really tasty , their other options are also a must try.",4,Positive

this is the first place i came with my best friend. he forced me to come out of my room and asked me to decide about the food. shawarmas. that was it. i saw that i could try the vegetarian version here, so i was happy.

we had our respective types of shawarmas: he had chicken and i was more than joyous about having the vegetarian one. we got to listen to good music, hear the incessant chatterboxes talking out loud but we found silence in our own way and conversed about our ideas. it was good food, good company and a great experience. just that, it can hurt your pocket a little!",4,Positive

"i've ordered chicken pizza squares (6pc). i waited for almost 20 mins. they served 6pc of sandwich bread topped with some chicken. i thought that they've served it by mistake. i asked the staff and they confirmed that the served thing is called ""pizza"".

"this place is very common to the corporate people who work in dlf and its premises for its reasonable price and food with perfect quantity and quality .the only thing i would suggest everyone is do not opt takeaway/homedelivery for waffles because when hot waffles are made they are immediately stored in plastic boxes due to which hot air is released by the waffles and condenses in the box itself thus it becomes very soft and disgusting to eat .i have ordered best of both worlds (reg. waffles,pancakes,scrambled eggs and cold coffee)and veg iron monster(panneer biryani and coke) pancakes were yummy along with maple sauce,scrambled eggs were amazingly toasted without using much oil.panneer biryani was just ok a bit more flavoured.cold coffee tasted like regular one.packing quality needs to be improved.",4,Positive

"delivery review
what i ordered - best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which i choose tea
price - 199 plus taxes.
food review - the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such. the scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics. waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down üëá. tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute. special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3 üåüüåüüåü for me. over all if u r health conscious may be it's an absolute visit for u but for me 3 and half for now till next time.",4,Positive

"the name is so appealing that when we saw it,we were like, yes let's go.
because all of us just looovee the movie üòÅ
but also because it's on a busy roadside. very convenient location.

it was wednesday and had a ladies night i think. but as you know, gold can't be availed with ladies' night privileges üòî

we got seating very easily. don't know of that was a good thing or bad, because the place was very empty. only 2 other tables were seated i think.

ambience is okay.. music- can be better. cocktails were good. you can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it.
service- can be better. was slow , when you look there were very less crowd.
food is very nice. pocket friendly place.

hope next time i get to see a good crowd and good music",3,Neutral
"so now this has left me with no option but to write a review after coordinating with the manager mr. rounaq ali to get my 678 + taxes inr back for the incorrect billing. i made the payment for a total amount and when i got back home realised that the bar used my zomato gold coupon but didn't apply to the final billing. utter disappointment. they need to ensure that they don't do an incorrect billing as everyone has trust. sorry to say it failed here.

"we were 5 friends and i specifically called to ask if stags are allowed. manager told that stags are allowed. once we reached, the bouncer refused us entry saying stags are not allowed on dance floor. i called manager again he also denied entry. i can't understand why can't they clarify the same on call. i spent so much money on cab only to be denied entry. la la land sucks.",1,Very Negative

"the most horrible and disgusting place i have ever been to. they have a big menu to offer but most of it is not available to be served. the food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history. the waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or english. the acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks. when we asked for a manger, three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won't pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied, arrogant and rude manager showed up. his name is ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn't need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn't want to do anything about it. when i tried explaining him that we would pay the bill, add tip and don't want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously, he was like ""if u r leaving, leave, why are u wasting my time?"" i lost it and i was telling my friend, i repeat, i was talking to my friend stating ""what the fuck is wrong with this place"" is when he interrupts me and says that i need to mind my language. i was like, what? ""i"" am talking to ""my friend"" about the ""place"" what's your problem in that? and i literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ""ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, ukhaad lo."" so that pretty much defines this place, the food and the people. don't be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review. but yeah, if u think u can reach ali a nice lesson, please go ahead, all my blessings are with you üòã",1,Very Negative

"we went for lunch buffet. 
very limited options for starter - 3 non-veg(2 chicken and 1 fish) and 3 veg(2 potato and 1 paneer). they were serving the starter cold. the tawa fish was over spicy and they didn't prepare a lesser spicy version of that even after our request. only chicken wings was good.

main course was kind of good. egg fried rice and veg noodles were good. chicken biriyani was stale.

dessert was good. chocolate cake, gulaab jamoon and ice cream were good. semiya kheer was horrible.",2,Negative
"well sometimes rating can be misleading. we visited the restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine.
the beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of corona bucket. bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled. well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp. we were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp. and the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer.

we asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had dragon chicken served. eating it all i can say if it's ur best then your worst is not for humans.

next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud.

all i can say if you know what a good food, ambiance and hang out place never ever visit this place.",1,Very Negative

service is also good and i love their all 99 tuesday menu for starters and drinks as it‚Äôs all the worth. however, they should maintain consistency in having all those limited menu items available and not just make an attractive tuesday menu for sake of it.
4 üåü mostly because the value for tasty food is worth it. hopefully in next visit they don‚Äôt say we don‚Äôt have cheese starters in limited tuesday menu! üòõ",4,Positive

"we went today for an office team lunch. we were around 25 in number and had made prior reservation. reached there at sharp 12:30 .we had to ask the manager to get all the seats as he allotted seats to some other customers despite of our reservations. the first started was served 1/2 hr after we were all seated. one plate of starter served by one person to 25 people. i had to ask the manager to add few more people to serve but he refused. 
after the first serving of 1 veg starter we waited for another 20 mins. 
my colleague asked the manager if more veg starters will be served, and this was his answer.
""abhi aap ne kya khaya ??.. panner khaya na.... woh veg hi hota"".
we were shocked to see such a response and rude behavior from him.

"we went here for 31st 2018 evening after reserving table for 3. they told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything. so it was 1500 for us 3 and food & drinks charges being seperate. we saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine.
when we went there, for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500. cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee.
we always keep cards mostly, luckily we had that much cash, paid and went inside.
got a table for 4 for us 3.
so like first mistake of staff when ordered a mojito- mocktail as i dont drink, and they instead of mocktail send a cocktail - alcoholic drink.
second mistake of staff, as we are purely vegetarians- in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter. and they came and served non veg starter.
after complaining about this both to staff, they apologised and said it won't repeat.
now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again, again for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a non veg starter again to us.
i complained to manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do least.
not that i asked for any but that was courtesy on their side.
so when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it.
ok and the last thing, the dj mostly 70% of time was playing very old songs which i again didn't enjoy.

prefer to have spicy food it's the best place to visit .. starters were amazing fish was superb (spicy) .

in main course, we ordered dal makhani and paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations.

went here with friends expecting this to have some cool jazz music because of it's name(lmao) but it was still a nice experience. everybody enjoyed their drinks and the food was good. the dacefloor isn't half bad either if there aren't too many people dancing.,4,Positive
"this restaurant has its priorities straight. unlike ab's, flechazo, and barbeque nation- that swing for the fences and end up failing many times- this place has hit a sweet balance between hospitality and taste.

which means you have none of the irritating, fake-friendly, over-eager monkeys from the above-mentioned places, pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don't want to.

instead, you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business, until you order for something. very professional, indeed.

the starters are awesome here; they actually set the tone for the things to come. this place features a wide-range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well, which is a big step up from its competitors. kebabs are to die for.

having said that, the main meal was nothing to write home about. they have tried a lot of things, from mughlai, intercontinental, to chinese, but somehow these dishes don't come together on the plate.

but what actually took my heart away, what this joint excels in, hands-down, compared to any freaking restaurant in the city is the desserts department. for someone who loves sweets, it's a psychedelic experience.

the variety and taste will haunt you for days. the desserts are neither too sweet, nor too rich. just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about.

i was thoroughly satisfied, and if you leave out the clove-heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu, then the place is a rockarolla discovery. definitely worth one visit, and then the count will just keep on ticking!",3,Neutral
this place opened last year and is a small place but is very happening . the evening i went there was an office party going on and there was a buffet catered for them. this place has a small dance floor and nice interiors. they have a huge variety in their food and alcohol menu and they taste amazing. they even have a lunch buffet menu at a reasonable price! do visit this place if you are in gachibowli!,4,Positive

however they have done complimentary sweet for everyone the day i went there. that wasn't all that good. way to sweet. uhh. and my friend is a non-vegetarian, he had some chicken biryani and sure he licked his fingers. awesome ulavacharu. i'm coming back soon. thank-you.",5,Positive

"one of the most recommended places to enjoy authentic andhra cuisine. been here multiple times and tried many dishes, they never let us down. as soon as we enter, we were offered with complimentary sweet - jalebi. (sometimes they forget, in so, you can ask for it)
among starters, bamboo chicken and bangla kodi are my favorites.
bamboo chicken is very tender and it gets cooked inside a hollow bamboo stick and its sizzling hot with yummy taste.
bangla kodi is very unique with each chicken piece wrapped in a sliced potato, this is a must try.
they have got a wide range of main course to cater to everyone's need, i have tried prawns vepudu pulav, this is the dish to go for if you like prawns, spicy, yummy, tasty, fulfilling and satiating.
pachi mirchi kodi pulav and gadwal kodi pulav are great too. raju gari kodi pulav is their signature dish, but it will be soggy so not everybody may like it.
don't forget to cool off your taste buds with rose milk or junnu in the end

ambience and service is very good but not the food",1,Very Negative
the place is really nice and gives a very strong telugu vibe. nice old songs to go with courteous service. we ordered for chicken fry pulav and sweet corn soup. sweet corn soup was ok. the pulav was really good but really spicy which was expected. suggestion would be to order a boneless pulav instead. also we finished with a veg ulavacharu biryani. the veg option was disappointing. should stick to non veg pulav/biryani and boneless.,3,Neutral

"i got to visit this place through a giveaway by @hyderabadfooddiaries and it was worth a visit. we tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices. mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy, perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine. the rajugari kodi pulao was the best of all.
this pulao had a different taste and texture, unlike biryani, this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry. this place has huge variety of appetizers, curries and rice in chicken, mutton,seafood and veg options.

as part of main course we ordered ""rayala vari kodi pulao"" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped ""raju gari kodi pulao"", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.

in short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.
bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing (inr 435) is high for the quantity we get.",3,Neutral
"it's worst place to dine

too much hyped!!!!!!!!!

last sunday we visit this with my friends.. i tried here bamboo chicken n pachi mirchi kodi pulav both not at all up to the mark",2,Negative
"was there for new years eve, the ambiance is great and so was the staff but it was overpriced by almost 50% and mutton wasn't cooked well.

fish vepudu though was finger licking good.

would have been 3 stars but reduced two because of pricing and poor mutton dish.",1,Very Negative
"we went on the new year day. menu was limited. we waited 1 hour almost to get our food on the table. service was horrible due to rush. food was not that tasty. we ordered rajugari natu kodi pulao, which was bland. we ordered kothmira kodi kura as curry with roti. it was just ok but less spicy. we ordered junnu for desert which was the only good thing amongst all the dishes bit the quantity was so less for the price. overall it's too much hyped restaurant with ordinary tatsing food at expensive rate. my suggestion better look for other options. don't go during festive seasons it's crazy crowded.",2,Negative
ambience was good..went on a busy afternoon..ordered mamsam roast..was okayish..then ordered ulavacharu chicken pulao and pachi mirchi royyala pulao..ulavacharu chicken was good..royyala pulao was nothing special..service can definitely improve..,3,Neutral

after hearing from my friends suggestions. i had prawns fry and chicken biryani... they need to improve food taste and quality... my dinner at ulavacharu. food is okay,2,Negative
"too much hyped....!!!

heard a lot about this restaurant, but finally it ended up with a disappointment, mainly the pulav's.
initially we were offered complementary sweets.tried pachi mirchi kodi pulav,oorugallu veg pulav,kotha kodi & crunchy curd cutlet.

pachi mirchi pulav - was nice but lacked the expected spiciness,though its a medium varient.
oorugallu veg pupav- mostly tasted like normal rice but the spice mix was quite authentic, tasted like baby onions coocked with mango pickle.quite a different experience, never had one like this before.
kotha kodi- just an edited version of chicken majestic.
crunchy curd cutlet - good but too oily.

finally ended the meal with a dessert(junnu), which was good of all the items i had in the restaurant.

good thing about the restraunt is it had a decent ambience and can accommodate quick a good number.service was generous but a bit slow.

overall food taste was just ok, lacked the heat.can be improved a lot...",3,Neutral
if you want something really spicy.. try ulavacharu.... starters are very tasty especially the peanut chicken. and good to listen to old songs..,5,Positive
"great ambience and awesome food served here. onion rings, curd cutlet, godavari royyala vepudu, bamboo chicken are must try starters. pachi mirchi kodi palau, raju gari kodi palau and gadwal kodi palau are good options for main course.

p.s. try their rajamundry rosemilk too.",4,Positive
"they tried to create authentic experience right from the ambiance. food is a real treat, especially for those who like andhra cuisine. bamboo chicken, raju gari kodi pulao, guthivankaya pulao, are a must try. the only drawback is the service, which is slow.

we ordered bamboo chicken and pachi mirchi kodi pulao. both the dishes had fresh ingredients.
bamboo chicken has good flavors but was more than mildly spicy. it is served directly from the bamboo box it is cooked in. it also has dry gravy so it's not entirely a good choice for starters, will go well with any indian bread.
pachi mirchi kodi pulao was awesome. the rice was flavorful. chicken curry served over it was semi - gravy and yummy as well. the chicken was nicely complementing the rice.
service can be improved a bit. will go again to this place to try other dishes.",4,Positive

i ordered raju gari kodi palav from this pathetic senseless restaurant. why the hell there is water in raju gari kodi palauo? it is full of water. i have to heat and boil it again to take water out and it became paste. is this how you serve customers? pathetic. i am never going to order again from this restaurant. stupid restaurant,1,Very Negative

"no taste in food, starters were served cold, probably it was already cooked so waiter suggested us that dish. it is expensive and not worth at all. they are trying to be over authentic and spoiling the basic taste of food.

not suggested to visit.",1,Very Negative

"good place for team visits , ordered raju gari kodi pulav and bongulo chicken both tastes great ....ambience is good, place can be extended to have more seats, it is always over crowded .. a must visit place",4,Positive
"india is a food nation, every 50 kms you travel from one point to another the taste,spices and the approach changes. andhra pradesh and telangana is no different. andhra the way they cook their dishes is more earthy and less spicy compared to telangana cuisine. rayalseema being all healthy as they use raagi, spices are very earthy. why am i preaching this because all these varieties are to be found in ulavacharu.

ulavacharu is a vibrant telugu brand having branches throughout hyderbad. banjarahills, gachibowli etc....

their unique dishes names, taste especially their crispy chicken skin, although a little tweeek is much needed to the palatte of hyd. so overall the setup is amazing it just doesn't serve food it gives you an experience. a must visit place. points to consider for restaurant their rose milk is a bad imitation of rajamundry ,they serve fruitpunch naming it as rajamundry.. so as i said tweeks are much needed.

4/5 is my rating",4,Positive
the moment you enter the restaurant the ambience is good.we ordered godavari royalla vepudu that was good.then we ordered gadwal kodi pulao was ok their sambar rice was so sour more of citrus taste that was not at all acceptable.,2,Negative
"so, when i went with my parents, i observed the restaurant was jam-packed with people (i swear, it was difficult to get to our seats also). in a way, i couldn't appreciate the ambiance much. we ordered ulavacharu vegetable pulao and what i believe was pandu mirapakaya (i hope i'm right). the food was tasty, well-made, with a slightly different mix of spices from the usual. i enjoyed the rice and the flavor it had. having never tried any rice item of that sort, it felt like a novel burst of flavors to my restless buds. i'd recommend trying the food here at least once.",4,Positive
"we went to the first floor confused whether to go to shanghai chef or kobe's, later to realise they are in the same restaurant (i.e they share floor space). we decided to order chinese. we had the dimsum platter (3/5), kung pao chicken (2/5), dragon prawns (2/5) and fried ice cream (4/5). the chicken was hard inside (not indicative of fresh chicken), the prawns were sweet and the dimsums had thick coatings. i did not enjoy my time at shanghai chef. so maybe when you're there, just try the sizzler. ill update my review when i have it.
kobe's is a really famous chain for sizzlers.",2,Negative
"they have a wide range of food offering. nothing much to talk about ambiance. i visited this place 2 times in a week. 1st time ordered a sizzler which was fantastic.  2nd time we had a chicken stater, soup and a american chopsuey. soup and starter was good but sea food american chopsuey was not good. being a person from coastal area i can tell if sea food is fresh or not, and boy, the prawns were not fresh that is for sure. all and all its a causal dinning if you crave for some variety of asian food.",4,Positive

i've been to shanghai chef 2 quite a few times now. twice before kobe sizzlers moved in and once after. it has great staff and a wonderful ambience. it gets busy over the weekend and you might have to reserve a table beforehand. their sizzlers are wonderful and they have a great set of starters. i would suggest you try them over the main course.,4,Positive

a small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. at first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for chinese food in gachibowli. food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with waiter over something. and to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. they should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen.,2,Negative

"the overall rating present for this restaurant doesn't justice the experience (will come to this in a bit)

so, a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on (to give romantic dinner table feel) and apt audible english chartbusters couldn't go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this.
with this as a beginning, shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best. waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests, not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen, not aware of all the 'must try' dishes of their own menu & most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers. like an example, since its not a fine dining we can't expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired. this was the case, when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate.
on the food side, crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup. flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times.also, service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled.

so, coming back to first line. the rating is probably for food only, go at your own risk if your are looking for experience !",2,Negative

"i have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core!
ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. it was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (p.s. we are a family who loves spicy food). also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. highly dissapointed with food!!",1,Very Negative
it's our default choice when we crave chinese food and if we are around the gachibowli area. the food tastes great and the fact that they are open all the way from lunch to dinner makes is a very viable option for a decent lunch at odd times in the evening when most other places are closed till dinner. the ambience has nothing to be complained about and the pricing is pretty decent.,4,Positive

went for dinner today. ordered honey crispy chicken and butter garlic prawns.

the seating is well, the air conditioning is not. its either chilly or completely stopped. you cant help it.

the servers are less and even being a small place, you have to shout to catch their attention.

the food. oh god! i dont know what happened with the chef that day, but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities. they were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter.

so many wrongs, bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was i unfortunate to visit them on their bad day. they also need a experienced manager.

"went to this place which a bunch of foodies for a review session and to my delight it turned out to be an awesome experience.
i always wanted to visit authentic chineese restaurants and this was the one.
the service was very good along with a perfect ambience.
lets begin with the food part:
we started with a couple of soups tom kha gai (which was a coconut milk based chicken soup and it was very yummy as you can feel the coconut flavour) followed by lemon corriander soup which was also good.
amongst the starters we tried tei pei chicken,kung pao chicken, phuket fish( this was one of the best as the fish was perfectly fried and it was also crispy), drawn prawns (nice crispy which nice sausage).
now the best part was the shu mai, the dumplings were great and delicious it was my first time though but i found it really great.
in the main course we had phad thai phak(spicy flavored rice with nice flavours and the aroma was too temptingüòã),burmese khow suey which were steamed noodles with several add-ons like peanuts, fried onions etc. (a must try one if you visit this place).
we also had some mocktails my personal favorite was fall in love along with a couple of other like fruit punch .....
the last but not the least the desert part we had fried ice-creams which had coconut base and it was very yummy üòã.
a nice place to visit if you are looking for some authentic chineese dishes.",5,Positive
"recently i went to this place for a review session with bunch of freaks. this place is located at indiranagar.
service was really great .

when it come to chineese cuisine , i thought to order few authentic dishes .

firstly they served us with soup : chicken manchow soup and tom kha gai/gung which is coconut based. people who likes coconut based cuisine then they must try this.
coming to starters we ordered tai pai chicken, dragon prawns, kung pao, phuket fish, dumplings named shu mai. out of these best was phuket fish which was crispy frm outside .

main course: they served us burmese know suey , again this is coconut based dish where the gravy is made out of coconut . it's served with plain noodles , add ons like peanuts, fried onions , green chillies, variety of suaces .
pad thai rice which was just like fried rice .

they also serve mocktails and desert.
fried ice cream was the best.",5,Positive
"i had visited few among many chinese places in past. recently got a chance to visit shaghai chef, located at prime location, indra nagar. welcomed nicely by the staff members.

i didn't thought much about food in starting, as people don't eat chinese daily and i am weak in remembering chinese dishes name, i had one thing in my mind, shezwan :p. but as soon as the dinner started, i was surprised, there is more to it, started with tom kha gai/gung - chicken soup, coconut based soup, creamy and smooth, with spices and topped with red chilli, one word, fantabulous. then the marathon started, one after another i was enjoying every bite, had few expression changes in between but at end, the conclusion - amazing dinner.

strated with starter, tai pai chicken, dragon prawns... pakoda kind, tossed to give a spicy flavour, i am not a fan of prawns, so can't say, kung puo chicken... was decent, phuket fish... basha fish, kind of crispy from outside, soft inside, tasted amazing, and the dumplings, named shu mai, open dumplings with minced chicken, it's not spices but is simply wow, go for it. tried few mocktails, was ok but need some improvement, other than that everything was good. and then the deserts, ice cream on brownie and fried ice cream were something hatke, must try.

in main course we had, burmese khow suey... noodles mixed with coconut kind gravy, not spicy with stuffs to add on, liked fried peanut, fried onions, chillis, diff sauces etc. and phad thai rice, both were also good. overall had a good time and dinner, the staff members made our food tasting visit more comfortable. recommended for good dine in, one can go with dishes with must try tag, if unable to decide and can consult staff members for know about the dishes.",4,Positive
"this restaurant have got a very peaceful atmosphere so been to this place for dinner with friends.we ordered soups 1st were my favourite was toma gai/gung which is a rich coconut milk based prawns thai soup.we can taste the thick coconut milk taste and being a malayalee i always love the coconut taste and i just loved this one.it is a mild soup which give a small sweetness of coconut milk.other two soups we ordered were manchow soup and chicken lemon coriander soup.manchow soup dint taste like how it is suppose to be.we ordered the chicken one so it was a spicy soup with a chilly and garlic combo and coming to the chicken lemon coriander soup,it had a strong taste of lemon with minced chicken and vegetables and i dint like that much but my friend who ordered this soup loved this.

now coming to the starters,we ordered dragon prawns,tei pei chicken,kung puo chicken,shu mai dumplings,phuket fish.we were served with dragon prawns first which was crispy added into a sauce and garnished with cashew nuts kinda dish which is spicy.tei pei dish was a starter which i loved than the dragon prawns one,which is mildy sweet one and not too spicy like dragon prawns.so the last starter we tried was phuket fish which was cooked well and it was fried kinda hard and added to soya sauce and tasted awesome.coming to djmoljngs we had shu mai dumplings which are steamed and half opened dumplings which was tasting too good with the chilly sauce.

we ordered mocktails after the starter and we had fall in love which i really loved which had a mixed taste of both litchi and strawberry,litchi punch which i ordered which doesn't give the colour of litchi and dint give too much of litchi taste,alfonza which is of mango and tasted great and also fruit punch which was a mixed fruit mocktail.they have mentioned mocktail with scoop of ice cream so i dint find a scoop in it or don't know whether they mix it with the juice and serve but all were tasting great.

now coming to the main course we had burmese khow suey and phad thai phak.we had the burmese dish which was ma favourite again as it is made of rich coconut milk and noodles one and too yummy for your tummy dish.this dish was served with other set of seasonings and condiments so people do try this one and you will love this and this is creamy non-spicy dish.phad thai phak which was of rice type garnished with an egg omelette which is like a fried rice dish and a spicy one.

last we had fried ice cream and brownie with ice-cream as desserts.both were yummy where brownie ice cream was served with butterscotch ice cream flavour with a strawberry sauce as the topping and fried ice-cream coating is made of coconut so do try these.",4,Positive

i loved the food. authentic chinese and nice ambience. taste was really good. had rice noodles after a long time and it was pretty good. the lamb and dragon prawns are must try.,5,Positive
"loved the food. very cute ambience. service was the downside, though. despite the crowd being normal and not heavy, none of the waiters were in sight when we needed them.

that being said, i recommend the wontons, the manchow soup and the chilly paneer. fried rice was a little insipid but other than that, a definite recommendation.",4,Positive
"thier platters might sound a bit confusing since they are more like normal starters but definitely taste good.
a must try item on their menu is bamboo rice. it has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours. i absolutely loved it.
do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu. i did not find anything very special in it. its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and i was expecting a little moderations there.",3,Neutral

"nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service.
the restuarant is located on first floor ,having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors -appropriately giving a glimpse of typical chinese restaurant .not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too ! i hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor (4/5)

the crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us .after exchanging a few words ,he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab .
owner and staff courtesy (5/5)

we first ordered talumein soup(3.5/5)-moderately spicy and filled with veggies ,which is certainly a healthy start

we ordered mee gorang noodles (3.5/5) - comprised of lots of green and red chillies .a perfect form of noodles to relish .
recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles

noodles accompanied with 8 hot pot garlic gravy(3/5) which went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of french beans that hindered the potential of dish.",3,Neutral
food was okay. we ordered two chicken dishes for starters and it had too much sauce in it. noodles were good. monis were really good though. would try again rest was okay. would try again if no options are available. :/,3,Neutral
"ok place. the food was just fine, but since it is reasonably priced, its decent value for money.
service is ordinary though.
on a sunday afternoon, the place was empty and it was hard to digest. i almost went out but then decided to give it a try anyway.
bottom line, if i want to eat relatively inexpensive chinese food, then this might be a choice, else no.",3,Neutral

"what a scrumptious dinner at shanghai chef 2.

after a long day at chilkur balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. however, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

the first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.we did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

the restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. so neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

we started off with tom kha ghai soup : actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. the garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

we then ordered nasi goreng chiken :long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **must try** and bar b q chiken : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**must try**

mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

for take away we ordered phad thai mix sea food noodles.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, i couldn't resist when rawshan opened the box at home. i went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. oh my god, this is one amazing dish that i have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. also fresh red chilli. *** a must must try ****

quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

for the taste and quantity and quality the vfm factor is best in the town.

bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

staff is very friendly and aditya was great at service.

we were about to leave suhail suhrac macadams bumped into us. it was great meeting you. and thanks for making our dinner so special.",5,Positive
"an awesome place to enjoy chinese. it looks very ordinary from the outside but the interior of the restaurant is very classy. the ambience is really very good. the most amazing and surprising part of this restaurant is it's food. i was so amazed with the food. it's a 100% must go place for all foodies. the prices matches the quantity+quality and doesn't leave a hole in your pocket. this sets the restaurant miles apart in comparison to other similar level chinese restaurant.
this restaurant will definitely be one of my top favourites while considering chinese.",5,Positive

i will prefer to visit",3,Neutral
"one of the best places to have south indian tiffin varieties in gachibowli area.  most cost effective and tasty, quick fast food on offer. i enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too.  if anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here. 

situated in a busy area on the gachibowli main road near to the orr inter-junction. you cannot miss the place. i have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints. 

absolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. there is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.  when your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. there are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. just eat your food quick and rush out. 

my fav of theirs is the dosa. i just loved the chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste. also loved the kerala parotta which is a fav dish of mine back home here in chennai.",4,Positive

"tried this place after a long time. the order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, mixed subzi chatpata and a strawberry milkshake.
arrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. after a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?

service 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. you will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. but no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. i literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.

ambiance 1/5 -
some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
in short a worthless place.

food quality and taste 1/5.
coming to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.
very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.
as mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. the south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), i was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. i seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, i have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.

value for money - 0.5/5

for these so called high quality dishes i had to pay around 900. in short i will not suggest this place at all.",1,Very Negative
"food is pricey and portion size is not justified. serving is super slow. tons tons of improvement required. if i have a choice, i'd avoid this place.",1,Very Negative

"i found this place pathetic. went yesterday, most of the dishes we ordered were not available. the excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave. i wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available.
i read on zomato reviews that their thali is good. and restaurant's menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well, but on reaching restaurant i found out they are not serving thali in dinner now. i travelled 9km to visit this restaurant.

food was pathetic as well. tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. and the dishes were either too oily or just bad.

overall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. there are plenty of restaurants all around hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.

avoid this restaurant at all cost !!!",1,Very Negative
i visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family. this is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining. but yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed. it took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order. then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali. i called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. but is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time. after 40 minutes the food was served. but the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out.,1,Very Negative

quality and quantity is very less for biryani combo.it is not worth of 150 rs.as a team we ordered 18 plates which is not sufficient.please look into it.,1,Very Negative
good thali spread for ugadi. the taste and overall experience was good. service was slow for non thali orders and had to ask multiple times to refill dal and sambhar in the thali,4,Positive
"overrated restaurant with pathetic service and average food. spent 2.5 hours just for starters and main course. had 2 rounds of rotis before paneer sabzi arrived. after asking manager that we have ordered main course more than half hour back, he told that you have ordered only 5 mins back. after this episode also it came after half an hour more. visit the place if you have free time and want air condition. nothing else you can expect.",1,Very Negative
one of the worst in and around gachibowli. i ordered two rice combo and sent one and collected money for two. such a non sense guy. the mathura villas owner. never believe in their words.,1,Very Negative
"we have ordered veg chilly sticks and golden baby corn.
veg chilly sticks are good and must try. golden fry baby corn and veg biryani are worst",3,Neutral
had been to this place for a lunch. decent place - had a south indian thali. food is okay - but can be a better in terms of taste. decent ambience & service. but something is a miss hereü§î,3,Neutral
"extremely disappointed with the service. they delayed serving the food. the staff is very lethargic and don't seem to care. save your time. go elsewhere. by the by, the pepper curry was the worst. don't try searching for this in menu for this dish. it isn't there. they added so much of pepper, it felt like some chef's spontaneous idea which messed up our palate. -_-",1,Very Negative
"ours was not a good experience, poor hospitali

staff is very reckless and they are least bother about the customer. we left without having lunch for keeping wait for more then 30 mins and the manager even not ask us to wait. he went inside to cancel the order,1,Very Negative
"visited this afternoon, pleasant ambience, temple like feeling with a bell at the door and a idol at entrance. ordered north indian thali, taste was okay, not an extraordinary thali though. served butter rotis, jeera rice and white rice,5 curries, dal. payasam and kheer. kheer was the highlight which i want to call out.
ambience 3/5
food 3/5
service 4/5",3,Neutral
loved the collection and flavour of indian cuisines and homely food. the staff are humble and will present food as per your customisation. that‚Äôs really good.,5,Positive
never order full meals online... at the end you will get disappointed with incorrect items.. from the given menu... expected alot by seeings reviews.,2,Negative
"for some reasons unknown to me, i decided to try this place. the thali on the other zomato reviews seemed worth a try i thought.
i was told thali would take 15 min, and i waited. after 25 min of waiting, when i started asking around, they said thali isn't available right now and will take another 20 min minimum. i lost it. no shame, no options to offer what could be served quickly. just a plain no. i walked up, they asked me to pay for a bottle of water (which i consumed) and left. the manager didn't even bother.
went to over the moon next door and had a great exp. folkd there told me this outliet of mv is in bad shape and likely to close soon.
if you want to take a chance of really poor exp, maybe no food, maybe bad food...",1,Very Negative
"visited with family.
overall decent ambience and decent veg food.

if looking for a pure veg place with decent ambience then this could be your place",4,Positive
"had been here on pongal to have ""veg lunch"" since my uncle and aunt were in hyderabad. my aunt insisted on having laccha paratha there which when arrived was found to be regular butter roti and the staff even insisted on the same funda that it was laccha paratha. this was a turn off for me but otherwise it is good veg restaurant to visit in gachibowli area.
so here goes my rating

food:3/5
ambience:4/5
service:3/5
budget: 3/5

hope i will have a good exeperience tge next time i visit mathura vilas.

"very bed experience.. they have created problem in deduction for zomato gold multiple times.
zomato should take action against this restaurant.",1,Very Negative
"this restaurant has gone way below the acceptable quality levels. had been a great place to go earlier but looks like they have started compromising in quality of food and service. items on the menu aren‚Äôt available but offered what they had at that time. rice was watery, none to care for your concern but were commenting on what was wrong and it was eatable. will never come here again.",1,Very Negative
"this place was a good veg eatery earlier, with options of good thali..but the experience which we had today completely my opinion.
food was cold, service was very slow, dirty tables and wares and ill maintained wash rooms. and on top of it misleadinƒ£ offer of 25% discount. i just had my last visit today.",1,Very Negative
"decent place for veg lovers. tried south indian veg thali, it was served with wide variety of items which were tasty. quality of the items could be improved a bit.",4,Positive
"south and north thalis are their go to options with good spread of varieties in them. ambience is decent for dining with family. only drawback is their slow service, they typically take 20-25 mins to get the thali. you might not find it crowded, but don‚Äôt let that fool you, it is a good place.",4,Positive
very busy place. rude waitress. thalis are very nice here but don‚Äôt try any other varieties because they taste very bad. i had very bad experience. only vegetarian food.,2,Negative
this place is really hiding next to the gachibowli flyover. this is undoubtedly the best north indian thali in hyderabad. been there twice and never was disappointed. the taste of all the items in the thali was amazing. i hope they maintain that quality. the ambiance is good and the staff is quite friendly who oblige you on your request for roti instead of puri. the south indian thali needs a tad bit improvement. best vegetarian thali in town! food taste 4service 5ambience 4value for money 4,4,Positive
"yesterday we have been to mathura vilas first time had ala kart, oh my god too much expensive and not worth of against quantity we ordered
kaju masala which is 265 inclusive of all taxes, he just gave in very small bowl, and ordered butter naan which is again looting only like 70rs each butter naan inclusive of all taxes, and coming to cool drink it's like ditched 70rs inclusive of all taxes. they simply loot your purse and money,",1,Very Negative
"i have been my third time here.
the food is quite good here. but when it comes to service we need a lot of patience.i have experienced the same third time.we had to wait for quite long time for food and even the bill

food - 3/5

service-1/5

need to improve in this factor",2,Negative
"firstly the seating tables and chairs interiors all are awesome but the foooooood when compared with its pricing did not meet the minimum standards i could it is worst the butter naan is charged at a rs 60 ? huhh the worst naan i ever ate and service what a pity i should stand and call a person for service and totally this restaurant is worthless for the service and the pricing
the pricing is very premium and the taste ! what a road side small dabas are very far better than this",1,Very Negative
"exceeded expectations, to frame it simply. simply loved the pure vegetarian food after a long time even being a non-vegetarian. all the starters we ordered are awesome. main course curries are good, but not as good as starters. ambience is good, serving has to be bit fast.",4,Positive
average food. have come across small amounts of mud in the food. they take a lot of time to serve food. the menu is also not that special given the name of the restaurant which belies it.,2,Negative
"pure vegetarian will like this place..really liked chilli vegetable sticks, thali and roti basked option..staff is very nice and courteous....",5,Positive
"ordered north indian thali, tastes bad, most of the curries are bad in taste, except one which is panneer. i had a feeling that chole curry was prepared yesterday and it smells & tasts bad. they served 2 sweets, semiya and kirayi. only semiya tastes good.",1,Very Negative
"very poor service. people are very slow, you have to wait for 15 minutes to get one item. the funny part is even for giving bill they take ages as if they are not interested in taking money as well. i will never recommend this place to anyone because of its poor service.",1,Very Negative
"super place for vegans, the food quantity is good enough, quality is also great, but the old boring music.ambience is nice, it is an efforable place for families",4,Positive
"serving was good taste also good more quantity of staters but it taste good for veg it's good option but they take more time get a dish, nice place",4,Positive
"this is a simple place to dine out. casual sitting with apt lighting. there thali and al- karte both are equally good and but prices are on a little higher side specially breads.

service is fine. good for pure vegetarians",3,Neutral
"we had been to the restaurant for lunch and ordered of course the south indian thali. it was served almost as shown in the pictures. 

ambiance: small & simple. the background music on kanhaiyya was very soothing.
service: was ok. no major issues.
food: food was good, definitely not exceptional but worth trying. the poori, poori's sabzi, pachadi, sweet & curd are very tasty.
price: slightly expensive.",3,Neutral
"#food was #good with right mix of #spices. we went in a group of 6. as soon as we entered they offered #seats and welcomed us. we had two kids with us they gave complimentary #ice #creams for them. it helped us making kids busy while we decided on the menu. menu had a good #vegetarian variety (we were looking for veg food). we ordered #north #indian #thali, which was yummy. it covered a good mix of curries.

overall food is good. just have to be a bit patient as i felt they were slow on service after ordering food (it may be because it had a parallel birthday party going on and was a bit crowded.",5,Positive
i have been to this place for random dinner with friends and it was the most stupid decision.. the place is the perfect example of mismanagement. the food was also pathetic. we have ordered sambhar rice after a lot of disappointment thinking that atleast it will come on time and will be good in taste but i guess they were checking our patience and it took almost 20-25mins for us to get that. they were so slow even in providing bill and on top of that they have added service charge without even our notice. i have given two stars only because the manager / owner (not sure) was really very courteous and he has asked not to pay by acknowledging our complaints.,2,Negative
"food - too salty and i did not understand how can someone go wrong with something as easy as bisebella bath.
even the other items were very average and salty

staff - with only twenty percent occupancy, the staff forgot the order. and in general the service is lousy

ambience - its neat and satwik.

i would recommend to give this restaurant a pass. its not worth the time and money.",1,Very Negative

3. roti/naan/parantha are on expensive side",4,Positive
"combo veg thali... worth to buy it... excellent taste ..
you can feel taste of each and every food item i'm that thali .
at end basmati rice has super aroma ..",5,Positive
"went here for lunch with family members, ordered south indian thali which is way more better than chutneys. ambiance was okay. service can be improved as we have to ask more than once to refill few items. overall a good experience.",3,Neutral
"food: its an awesome place. we visit once in 2 months with family covering a large distance due to taste of various items in its north & south thali. one could order more of any item of their like from the thali as its not limited.

service: sometime is slow, restaurant not ready for more customers or waiters lie on face that item is over and still serve to other customers before us then chef comes to rescue. the chef is courteous as takes feedback and works on it.

over nice place for quality food, not everything is 100% hence 4 star rating.",4,Positive
"i wants to try some veg cuisines, so found this place on zomato. i ordered tandoori mushroom and veg soft noodles. both the dishes was good and tasty. both the dishes were prepared in very less oil. ambiance was also good.",4,Positive

"we ordered veg thali here and trust me on this, food taste was good. perhaps they can do better on buttermilk area. serve in medium or large glass guys. we did not order tequila shots. average price levels. place to be with your office colleagues sometimes for quick feast.",4,Positive
"service - extremely poor 1*
food - average 2*
ambience- average 2*
overall not a good experience. we ordered for north indian thali, had to wait pretty long for it to come. finally arrived, now to make it worse, if we ordered for some more they took 20 mins or more to get the item. they are so slow in serving, you will loose interest in your food. welcome drink came after we finished having the starters, such is their promptness.",2,Negative
"what‚Äôs the point of taking zomato gold when there are so many restrictions on what is eligible. look at the terms and conditions - they are so restrictive. the main speciality of the mathura vilas, ie thali is not eligible for zomato gold. coverage of zomato gold needs to drastically improve. no point in having zomato gold otherwise",1,Very Negative
"apparently on holidays,half their staff too goes on a holiday.
the service was horrible, took them 10 minutes to clean our table and another 10 minutes to serve us water.
if this wasn't frustrating enough, they took 30 minutes more to get us undercooked food and some of the dishes in the thali were cold.",1,Very Negative
"mathura vilas.....the food really justifies the name....

food: üåüüåüüåüüåü

the typical vegetarian restaurant serves pretty good thalis. these unlimited thalis are served at lunch and dinner. there are wide variety of curries both in the south indian and north indian thalis. they should have included puri's in the north indian thali as well. the expectation is reached as they served this food in a banana leaf.

ambience: üåüüåüüåü

the ambience of the restaurant is good can't say great but it's good.

service: üåüüåüüåüüåü

the service was extremely good. they staff were very prompt and attentive. the wait time for the food is less.

on the whole a must visit restaurant for a hungry vegetarian.",4,Positive
pathetic place! we had ordered for non spicy food but what they served us was tasteless spicy food. also when we wanted to order for dessert they said everything in the dessert menu got over by lunch and hence there is nothing left for dinner.,1,Very Negative
"went there @ around 10:45pm, was really hungry.
had heard a lot about this place.

food was not good at all, roti‚Äôs (tandoori) could easily be confused with papad, both were so thin and cold.

sabzi was cold and seems like they didn‚Äôt care about customer.

even at that time when we were the only table operating there was so much delay for someone to attend our table.

not visiting this place ever again.",1,Very Negative
"i quite like the sumptuous north indian and south indian vegetarian thalis at this place. served hot. reasonably priced. not too fond of ala carte here, though i must add it is still better than a lot of places. the ambience and simple aesthetics of the place make it a great place for sunday lunch with family.",3,Neutral
"north indian thali was okay. we ordered paneer butter masala categorically saying don't use onion and garlic. the concern person said, he will serve. however, they still used both the ingredients.",2,Negative
"dont get fooled by seeing their advertisements, where they show lavish south indian thali served on banana leaf. we went there in search of authentic south cusine, but returned disappointed. they didn't have any kind of thali at dinner and serve only north indian ala carte. we ordered some soup and starters which was okay. then we ordered besibelebhat and curd rice, both were pathetic.they have a very confused theme. don't waste your time or spoil your mood.",1,Very Negative
"absolutely delicious food! telugu lo cheppalante - kammaga undi!!! after several years i have found a south indian thali in hyderabad that is a perfect blend of taste and spices. surprisingly every dish is tasty. it‚Äôs very rare that restaurants dare to include karela/bitter gourd in their thali. i should admire the expertise of the chef who included this fry by mixing it with podi. the brinjal curry/ bagaira baingan is exceptional. i should mention the choice of the tender and tiny brinjals used in this curry. aloo bajji, pulihare, anna paravannam/pongal, puri, papad, tomato curry with hot white rice made me get sleep right after the lunch. i give 5 out of 5, to the awesome chefs who can be an example to other restaurants, by keeping a simple menu and still impress the food lovers even without lot of spices/ghee/oil.",5,Positive
"worst service and behaviour.
we ordered schezwan noodles. we were served spoiled ones from the morning. it smelled stale, sticky to touch and yak in taste. worst experience. asked the waiter to taste a spoon so that he will come to know the pathetic taste. he tasted and took away calmly .
though i just had one spoon of it and returned back still they charged for it.
we spoke to the short fat manager for the charge levied on the spoiled food served which we didn't even have. he spoke very carelessly and extremely rudely.
will never ever visit this again.
strongly not recommended.",1,Very Negative
"had navratri thali here which was very tasty. had a very basic taste and was totally abiding to the food eaten in fasting.
place is nice and small. tends to become a little congested sometimes.
the only drawback is that this place is a little overpriced. navratri thaali was for rs. 300 and other items are also a little expensive.",4,Positive
i ordered veg. thali..which was just nt up to the mark. the fud seemed stale with out any taste. we just threw it. i won't recommend it to anyone,1,Very Negative
"everything a veg foodie crave for (though i am not vegetarian). form delicious food to amazing mathura lassi. though we ordered a-la-carte and enjoyed every dish gracefully, seeing the thali at a nearby table looked even more tempting. i don't much remember what we ordered as there were lots of dishes but every dish was a great experience. and do not forget to order lassi. service was also great!

must-have: lassi
ambiance: quite good
service: polite and quick

i will be visiting there to have thali next time.",5,Positive
"this was our first visit to mathura villas. we had visited this place on the last day of navratri for dinner. they only had special navratri thali in their menu for thali so we decided to go with it. we were utterly disappointed with the food:
1) the thali was filled with sambar, green chutney and sweet chutney, 1 peas corn gravy, 1 alloo gravy, mixture, navratan kurma and dry banana veggie, sour curd, samudana vada, samudana khichadi, payasam, fruit salad

2) there was no dal, no kadi, or any orther sabji/gravy in the thali. except for the kurma and corn-peas sabji nothing was appetizing enough

3) welcome drink like chaas/jaljeera which is usually a part of any thali in india was not served. on asking the manager he tells us that chaas is a part of the thali but that they missed swrving us

4) only fruit salad and payasam was given to us in the thali. again we had to ask the waiters if they had served all that was a part of the thali. only after enquiring abt the items did they mention that there is yet another sweet which they forgot to include.

5) they only had plain rice for the thali

overall there was absolutely nothing ""special"" about the so-called ""special navratri"" thali !",2,Negative
"disappointed with their so called special navaratri thali festival .. they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali, they told that they have only special navaratri thali.. we decided to order two of them..
nothing special in this one.. by navaratri thali you would expect kadhi, khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali (utappam, sambar, payasam, kela sabji, mixture from south and tandoor roti, puri, corn n peas sabji, tikki from north) and small mixed fruits salad, green chutney, sweet chutney, plain curd.. they had just plain steam rice ..

they missed serving us welcome drink of chaas/lassi

overall, disappointed for the price paid and options received.",3,Neutral

bit overpriced to the quality they serve but that seems ok.
hospitable staff, atleast hygienic dining area and good food that's the take away.",3,Neutral

"we visited this place many times. not so crowded.
good ambience. their thalis are good and a value for money.
their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the price(esp platters and other starters).
their service is very slow and you need to be patient.
i would rate this restaurant 3.5",3,Neutral

you should try this place. it will change your perceptions on veg food!",5,Positive
"awesome food.good for veg food lovers.they serve both thali and ala carte food.

we ordered manchow soup , tomato soup , tandoori mushrooms and tandoori aloo in starters.

mushrooms i must say was spicy but too good. almost melted in mouth. aloo was also good.

ambiance was ok ok.service can be improved.

overall very good restaurant for vegetarians.",4,Positive

"the cost of the food was 200, but the quantity of rice packed was more but the gravies very less for a meal.the paneer gravy was missing ,curd very sour.definiltely not worth for the money.",2,Negative
"went here for dinner with family to try their notorious south indian thali, only to know that it is served only in the afternoon lunch, greatly disappointed and order north indian thali as there is no other go, and one corn fried rice.
to our delight, north indian thali was awesome, enjoyed every dish present in it, roti, channa curry, paneer, bhendi, and a gobi starter, each one of it delicious. unable to finish the whole quantity as we were full with more curries. sweet was very different and scrumptious.
corn fried rice was equally palatable and went well with curries that came in thali.
definitely try this pure veg restaurant, when you want a break from all those spicy and masala non veg dishes.
it was deserted on the day we have been here, not sure of the reason for less crowd. ambiance is also great, service is reasonable and price is also affordable when compared other restaurants.",4,Positive
"it was ganesh chaturthi and we decided to try something veg special . having heard so many good reviews about this place , i insisted on going here.

with a pretty decent ambience , this place is very easy to locate . the staff is courteous. we order the special thali which they were serving that day. it was a combination of both north indian and south indian thalis . believe me, the quantity is so much and it is unlimited.

there were around 4-5 curries out of which there was paneer, potato , cauliflower and 2 more . there were 2-3 sweet dishes including kurbani ka meetha. there was daal, sambar, curd and papad. all these were served with rice and poori and lachha paratha. there was also buttermilk as a complimentary drink.

the cost of the thali was 300 plus taxes so it costed around 330 per thali.

for all those non vegetarian buffs like me , u will love this place if you like to experiment with vegetarian options too sometimes . and my vegetarian friends, u will love this place. so just get going and have a foodilicious experience.!",4,Positive

"definitely worth a try if you're looking for some lip smacking north indian food.

must try: kadai paneer, garlic naan, shikari murgh, dum ke aloo, and chicken nachos.

patiala lassi is a must try as well but i wasn't too happy about it cause it didn't have much authenticity to it. it sure would be a game changer if they brought in some changes to it.",4,Positive
"i went to this place for a lunch with my friend. we were the first one to land at the restaurant - sharp @12noon. yeah! we were actually hungry. i liked the place - decoration was awesome! cool interior. we ordered veg machaow soup, masala papad, butter naan, paneer massallam and masala cold drinks. please do note they give only masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink. we liked the food, taste was good. but the cold drink was tasteless - i guess it was already opened one so couldn't get the taste bar that everything was good. ambiance was actually the best - decoration, the and ample space. but service could have been good and fast.

"we had ordered the spicy mutter paratha (2/5) and the mooli paratha (3/5). the parathas were thick and there was no butter on them. it comes with a drink(3/5) and dal makhani(3/5). now i am not a regular paratha eater but occasionally i love my aloo, gobi and mooli ke parathe. i have always ordered and found them to be good but this time i was disappointed. from the looks of the paratha, i am sorry to say this, but it didn't look very punjabi. punjabis know their paratha well and wouldn't compromise on it. cheers!",2,Negative
"we visited this place during weekdays. this place is at prime location , easily accessible and has good ambience. we ordered tandoori and lasooni tikka. both of them were under cooked and were not worth it . main course was not good either. servings were taking lot of time to complete.",2,Negative

"i visited this place with my friend. it is there right in the heart of gachibowli's indiranagar, vinayak nagar.

upon entering, you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant, which it is. the ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off. there are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight.

then comes the interaction with the staff. they are quite friendly and hard working too. they do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark.

menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates. i really liked the way they split between veg and non-veg food.

we ordered quite a lot of stuff but i really liked the dahi kebab. it was good. but with such good starter i had pinned my hopes on patiala lassi. but that was an anti climax of sorts. they used essence for the lassi. i hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top. that will surely be a game changer.

overall... it was a mixed experience and hence 3/5.",3,Neutral

we opted for 599 unlimited menu. gosh it has like so many items that you will get confused what to order. main course was great, the butter chicken and mutton were cooked properly and tasted really amazing. however, the chicken starters were lil salty.

service needs a lot of improvement. service is really slow, but then the staff is really courteous.
should really come back to this place to try some more dishes from the menu as i'm sure they will be great.",4,Positive

"we ordered butter chicken, paneer makhani, dal makhani and mango lassi. the gravies had no distinctive flavor. they were overtly sweet and tasted nothing like the original dishes. the dal makhani was tolerable (but not good). since it's mango season, expected the mango lassi to be made of fresh ingredients (our fault for not checking). expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews.",1,Very Negative

"‚Äùnai, they don‚Äôt have any punjabi gal‚Äô

first things first, really not happy with their service. two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers.

so finally we got our order after 20-25 min of wait. the lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell. in starters amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai. this came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part. methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces. unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad, it was the flour which got stale over the time may be. don‚Äôt know how they served it. so we ordered boneless murg, i guess it was murg musalam, this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy, thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken.

overall one time try stop.",3,Neutral
"food tastes great for a quaint little place snuck in inner lanes of gachibowli! the place is lively with punjabi music and the friendly staff.

as vegans that eat food with little oil and spice, three of us had a sumptuous meal that comprised of tandoori aloo and kebab as starters. the initial order of a different kebab was sent back as the chef didn't comply with our little/no spice request. our order of aloo parantha and veg kolhapuri came as requested, however the ajwain laccha parantha and roti came laced with butter/ghee. the bread was replaced in 5 min or so as requested. aloo parantha combo came along with raita and chole. we requested raita to be replaced with another serving of chole, and the staff gladly obliged.

barring the few delays due to non-compliance of our requests, we found the food to be delightful, tasty and filling for a weekday dinner. the shikanji was great too! the staff are courteous, but definitely could do well with internal communication with the chef(s) to ensure requests are fulfilled. go for it!",4,Positive
"this is a go-to place for people staying in and around gachibowli. finger licking punjabi food. even a simple dal and roti tastes amazing here.

you can have absolutely anything here and it would turn out to be good.

nizami handi was very rich, heavy but very tasty. it could have more balanced mix of vegetables and cream gravy. dont go by the photo, taste was good.

mushroom manchurian is something i have never had before, tasted like manchurian. personally still prefer good ol manchurian. can definitively try if you have not eaten before..bit meaty in taste!

for main course: aloo onion paratha, amritsari kulcha and judwa paneer. 4/5
one plate of paratha/kulcha is enough for one person the side serving are also good in taste. judwa paneer was also good.

been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food. but my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit. tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters. little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish. butter chicken which was ordered more didn't meet the taste buds. the chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer. the only dish which met our expectation was patiala lassi. this drags me to this place again n again. hope such things will be taken in near future.,3,Neutral
"i regularly order from this place and also personally had visited this place.
this restaurant offers tasty food.

the food was good and tasty. in budget as well. the packing contained a plastic cover which was a bit hassle to remove.

went here on last friday. i didn't knew about this restaurant before just found out in the street and went. food here was awesome. i had ordered for dahi kebab and it was outstanding. the food presentation and quality and taste all were good ... would certainly love to visit this place again...!!! hope they keep continuing their good work.,4,Positive
"when you love food and especially north indian food you crave for the perfect butter chicken that you would probably get up north.

i guess i finally seemed to have found it in hyderabad.

having been to the best indian food joints like grand trunk, norfest i guess the butter chicken here ranks at the top... each one of them are good in their own regard though..

i landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through zomato but through swiggy ( somehow that's an irony given that both deliver the same distance zomato doesn't deliver from here to my place)

so probably i will not comment on ambience and service.. will update that later once i visit the place but food is something that's outstanding

in the last 20 days i would have ordered 3-4 times that's a lot for me given that i don't get fixated to a place as i m more of a food explorer üôÇ.

the food has not disappointed me so far. items tried so far
punjabi butter chicken - must recommend , the best you will find in town
veg angara - good
bhatti kamurg - must try
tandoori momo - can be avoided
dahi ke kebab - brilliant for vegetarians
murg malai kebab - good
murg tikka masala - must recommend, the best part is that both the gravy's ( of this and butter chicken) are completely different which is hard to find. a person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
dal makhani - must try
tandoori murgh - must try

so that pretty much sums up my journey with the restaurant for the past 3 weeks.. it's awesome do try if they deliver to ur place.

stuffing ourselves with the starters, we settled for dal makhani with missi roti & lachcha parathas, for we couldn't eat in more.

the portion of food served was also less.",3,Neutral

overall it's a good place to try out different kinds of biryanis",4,Positive

the last time i purchased food here would actually be the last time i would eat from here.

this restaurant is a classic example of how it started on a grand note and ended up being just another restaurant with hygiene issues.

to cut the long chase short, i had purchased 2 items. 1 paneer tikka biryani and bhimwaram pulav (take aways)

in spite of telling them, both items were very spicy. my wife and i were struggling with the food. now to top it, i found a flying insect (not a cockroach but something else with wings) that got cooked with the paneer tikka biryani.

"i cant fully comment or give a full 5 star rating but i would definitely start with a 4 star as the kebabs i ordered were simply one of the best i have ever had. 

i ordered chicken malai kebab and chicken hara mirchi kebab. both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them. i really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor. while the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab, i preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab.

although a bit on the pricier side, given the flavors and the taste, i am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything, the biryani would definitely be flavorsome. 

food - 5/5

soon i went in, i was greeted by the friendly staff, and incredible aroma of biryani's from other diner's . we managed to snag our table.

being settled down, we ordered few mocktails
mango lassi, as this is season of mango's‚ù§Ô∏è , ginger lemon, ginger cola, lemon soda, sparkling blue. each of the mocktails looked picturesque.

mango lassi and lemon soda were best out of all. rest other mocktails were good.

to start with dinner, we had soupsüëáüèª
lemon coriander : this is a clear soup, along with some broccoli, carrot. veggies gave us a delicious taste and it's a healthy soup to start with.

we have order crispy veg, corn 65, apolo fish, tender chicken, bangla kodi, chilli prawns

crispy veg: all vegetable (onions, potato, carrot) were deep fried.
it tasted average.
it can be better.

corn 65: corn kernels were mixed with floor , and some ingredients, corn kernels are made in to balls and than deep fried, served with mayo.

tender chicken, prawns are must try here.

main course : avakya chicken biryani, afghani biryani's , veg noodles

veg noodles: vegetable in it makes the noodle to give crunchy texture, sauces gives us a distinctive flavour. noodles were soft, somehow i liked the noodles here.
afghani chicken biryani: it is one exclusive biryani here, on top of biryani' they serve omlet.

we have ordered some indian bread, with tomato cashew, and chicken curry.
tomato curry with cashew was best one i had , so in hyderabad.

one cannot end dinner without desserts:
we have ordered junnu, jamun, kurbani ka meeta. i liked the jamun here, it was soft and tasted yummy.
i had a bad experience with junnu , everyone has a off night now and again, may b on that day junnu was bad.",4,Positive

the lovely place is properly situated at the prominent cross roads of biodiversity, gachibowli, right opposite to nissan showroom. the place and its ambiance is quite cozy as the lighting is subtle and ambient which blends in pretty well with the interiors of the restaurant. the staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to mr. sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner.

as soon as we sat down, we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails. a group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely sparking blue, mango lassi, ginger cola, ginger lemons, virgin mojito, masala cola. out of all the mocktails, masala cola and mango lassi stood out and were the best. the other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.

delicious appetizers:

crispy veg: a variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that wasn‚Äôt new that we didn't have, but it tasted excellent!

corn 65: it tasted absolutely delicious. corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel! thoroughly recommended.

bangla kodi: which was a signature dish of the restaurant, but for us it was a dish that also stood apart.

chilli prawns: spicy, stirred fried, it tasted awesome.

tender chicken: the star of the appetizers. brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter. highly recommended, please don't miss out on this dish.

apollo fish: so it was a fish. apart from that about the taste was okays‚Äôish.

main course:

chettinad chicken: very spicy and it went absolutely well with the butter naan.

kolhapuri chicken: mild flavours, the taste was good!

uluvacharu chicken biryani: this was the highlight of the dinner, unique taste and flavors, the restaurant lived up to the name of biryani, highly recommended.

avakai chicken biryani: a novel kind of taste for me and i really liked it.

afghani chicken biryani: mild flavor biryani topped with egg-omelet, it tasted really good.

desserts:

qubani ka meetha, junnu and gulab jamun were served to us and we were extremely dissatisfied with the desserts. i earnestly request the effective management to please look into the dessert part. everything else made it a great evening to hang out with family and friends for good indian biryani flavours.

biryani and more, a new outlet in gachibowli is fine-dine restaurant.
it has recently opened and serves varieties of biryani and other food dishes.
this restaurant is on the ground floor and can be easily spotted by the crowd passing by the road.
i‚Äôve been here for a dinner session.
the ambience of this place is quite good with bright lights all over the place.
it was a weekend and there was a pretty good amount of crowd at that time.
we started with mocktails.
they had many varieties of mocktails,out which we ordered the sparkling blue,ginger cola,mango lassi,ginger lemon and ginger mojito.
all the mocktails were of different colours making them very appealing for us to drink.
almost all the mocktails had mint,lemon and ice which was refreshing!
the mango lassi was too sweet.
then we were served with soups,
veg lemon coriander soup
chicken manchow soup
the veg lemon coriander soup was served hot with parboiled broccoli.
the chicken manchow soup was full of flavour and was served with crispy fried noodles,it tasted delicious.
we were then served with starters,
apollo fish:
the fish was well cooked and soft but had so much of salt in it.
tender chicken:
this was something very tasty,the chicken was soft,tender and with good amount of spice.
bangla kodi:
it is one of the most popular dishes,it was crispy,light and was well presented with coriander garnish.
the chilli prawns:
the prawns were juicy,spicy and had great flavour.
crispy veg and corn 65 were other vegetarian starters which we had.
they also were good but not that great.
next we were served with main course:
they served us different types of curry‚Äôs with indian breads.
the chicken chetinadu,its a spicy chicken curry which was too good.
the other curry‚Äôs were chicken tikka masala,tomato cashew nut and ulvacharu chicken.
the ulvacharu chicken,a chicken curry with horse gram soup was outstanding and finger licking good.

biryanis:
we were then served biryani.
avakai chicken biryani
afghani chicken biryani

avakai chicken biryani is a authentic andhra dish,it had a wonderful taste still haunting.
afghani chicken biryani is very different from other biryani,it had unique flavour.
it was served with egg omelet above the biryani .
we ended up our meal with deserts,
qubani ka meetha,gulab jamun and junnu.
the deserts were not that great and had disappointed me.
overall the restaurant has good biryani‚Äôs and i would suggest everyone to visit this place especially for avakai chicken biryani.

the place is simple and sober, nothing fancy. 

food (4/5): 
chicken 65: it has strong garlicy and gingery aroma. medium spicy, soft boneless starter. 
paneer tikka: smoky soft paneer 
ulvachuru biryani: yummy . rice along with some red colored gravy gave it a nice juicy touch. however they used regular rice, we were expecting basmati rice. 

moderately priced. ~800 for the above three dishes. 
quick service and courteous staff.",4,Positive
"i ordered my lunch from this place and it was really disappointing experience for me. i had ordered garlic naan, chicken patiala, pepper chicken and chicken majestic.
garlic naan was somewhat ok. but, chicken patiala was not at all as expected, it was somewhat sweet and with a different color and the taste was also not good.
pepper chicken was over fried, which was giving a burnt taste.
chicken majestic was also not that good. thin strips of chicken being served which serves any justification to the name itself, neither by it's taste nor appearance.
my personal experience with biryanis and more was not at all good.",2,Negative

"i went to the diners pavilion, gachibowli on april 14, 2019 at 8:15 pm to attend the birthday party of my friend's child's birthday. i asked security about valet parking and he said, yes there is valet parking, so i gave key to park my car. in fact, that security guy was very unprofessional, and he never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a non-parking area. i was shocked when i received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th apr 2019 for traffic violation. in fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. if restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.

with situation, i have no choice so i have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.

"from what i have heard about this place is that, it is more popular for its spread in lunch buffet. but we decided that we'd debut this place for some drinks post-work and barged into this otherwise dessert place around 9:30 in the night. not very crowded on a weekday, nice ambience, clean washrooms, wide options to choose for (drinks and food), decently priced and quick service - qualities we usually look for in any good restaurant! üòä

the problem came when we asked for bill. in the bill they added 10% service charges and gst.
we asked why again service charges when there is gst.
first, they denied and later reduced 10% service charge.
the online payment method took 15 min to verify the payment from waiter to owner.
one big suggestion is, please check your bill before payment. why should we pay 10% extra to these greedy people.

"3.5 went here for dinner on saturday night. almost empty, only two other tables occupied. so were sceptical, anyways got seated. inspite of this it took good 15 min anyone could attend us. the reason cited was heavy rush in the partner restaurant above!! wiered.. however the food was served quickly. we had tomato shorba, veg pizza and crispy veg. all items were good, nothing wow to say about. availed zomato gold. overall ok experience, nothing compelling to visit again.",3,Neutral

~buffet spread (4/5)
coming to the buffet spread, i really loved the fresh and soothing welcome drink, probably cranberry juice it was.
as for the starters, there were so many options and service was good too even at the wee hours of a friday lunch afternoon.
i really loved the cheese broccoli, crispy corn and chilli my among the veg ones.
and in my non veg options, chicken hariyali tikka, fish tikka were amazing.

next comes the main course, although i was a little disappointed with so less variety of dishes here, but the starters already filled my hunger pangs and i could only taste some cucumber mayo salad and some nicely cooked chicken dum biryani with a an okayish mutton roganjosh.

last but not the least, we ended our lunch with hot gulab jamun along with vanilla ice cream. there were some cut fruits and butterscotch pastry too but they weren't that great.
yet again a disappointment in desserts section!!üòêüòêüòí

"visited this place for my team lunch, and the experience was pathetic.
prebooked the tables online, got call back from restaurant asking for some advance money for the lunch. something new which i didn‚Äôt come across in recent times. this somehow got sorted and when we came there for lunch,
they are on 3rd floor, when entered the lift - it was leaking water from its ceiling.
entered restaurant, look was good, our tables were arranged, we said about number of veg and non veg plates. starters were served on the table.
service was very bad, slow and no one was very much bothered about refills, had to request multiple times for refills. taste was mild, some lacked salt, some lacked spice. over all starters were ok.
then comes the main course and main culprit- when we reached for food, most of the bowls were empty. so waited for refill- in the meanwhile my eyes fell on available prawns curry. i got them in a bowl and few roties on my table. prawns were raw.... yukkkkkkk.... not properly boiled and cooked. i said this to the manager out there, but got a cold response. i didn‚Äôt try anything else in main course, but some of my frnds said biryani was ok but others were bad.
halwa, ice cream and cut fruits were on deserts.

when were were done with our lunch- then manager came and apologised for the prawns and asked me to retry as he got them prepared again for me - it made me feel privileged. had discussed on other items with the manager, and got my prawns in a bowl. to my surprise this was even pathetic experience. he mixed the older ones with the new curry and made it even worse.

i would highly not recommend this place.
sorry sorry for choosing this place for a team lunch.",1,Very Negative

- chilli cheese naan
- shrimp fettuccine (for sea food lovers only)
- thread chicken

butter chicken and lal maans was okay, not that great.
under mocktails, i tried the pino orange, it was just a plain orange juice.

the starters, especially the fish was too salty. need improvement there.

i ordered food from here through swiggy. had a guest coming over for dinner. ordered butter chicken and adraki mutton. the dishes were horrendous and inedible. the butter chicken had gone stale and smelt pungent. the adraki mutton's gravy was nothing but oil. was shocked to see such atrocious quality being sent. what was more nerve wrecking was that i was banking on these dishes for my guest. will never ever order from here. wish i could give you a rating less than 1.,1,Very Negative

"i would rate this place 4 out of 5. food - starters are tasty, they don't have more variety in main course for veg people but whatever they served was tasty also i feel there should be some more variety of sweets as when we went to this place we found only ice cream, cake and some halwa. we visited this place around 2-2:15 p.m and we were only left in the restaurant and i believe it was there closing time so they couldn't give more attention to us. this restaurant is worth giving a try.
team dp one suggestion add some variety in sweets.",4,Positive

"we did not had a good experience as my rating says it all!

the main issue which annoyed me was the non veg was being cut just behind where veg main course was served. we being vegetarian, it was not a very good site.

in dessert, initially only halwa was there and then ice cream and gulab jamun was added.

starters were also extremely salty.

overall, except the ambiance and good music, this place is not meant for us.",1,Very Negative
"went for lunch party...usual buffet spread but food tasted real good. ambience is wonderful and interiors are neatly done...starters are served at the table. value for money place. very comfortable unlike other buffet spots that are crammed for space. it's the usual problem in gachibowli where you have to park the cars on the road, their valet parking being shared with other outlets is usually full.",4,Positive

"the food here is a total insult to restaurant business. i ordered lal maas- which was totally not the dish at all, it looked and tasted unhealthy(full of red onions, they shd hav named d dish lal piyaas). neways, i asked the manager to replace the dish and he insisted on trying their adrakhi malai mutton which again was not the dish they had mentioned in d menu. instead of adrakh they put garlic ‚Äî a lot of it! with a watery type gravyü§£. upon complaining, the manager said that their head chef has left for the day, hence the food is not the way it is. i mean dude! seriously! thats your reason?. guys pls stay away from this place. its a place for disrupting ur digestives system, insult to your hard earned money and insult to the mutton they procured to cook.",1,Very Negative
"my second visit to this place. visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. this visit was better than the last one. was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.

the ambience of this place is decent. there were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. upon requesting, the waiter served us ketchup and green chutney. as we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. they included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and chilly eggs. tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. the egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.

veg tom yum soup was decent. the main course was a bit disappointing. paneer butter masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name kashmiri pulao wasn't actually kashmiri pulao. the two other veg curries tasted average. the desserts consisted only vanilla ice cream, gulab jamun and moong dal halwa. this was probably the most distasteful moong dal halwa i've ever eaten.

the service was prompt. but, this place didn't give me any reason to why i should visit again, at least for a buffet. the only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. but i think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.

i've visited places less than 1km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. if they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because i'm not visiting again if i can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.

"had the ‚Äúprawns phad thai noodles‚Äù and ‚Äúveg greek salad‚Äù.

ratings ::

1. food quality : 5/5
one word: fantabulous!

2. food quantity : 4/5
veg greek salad - medium bowl
prawns phad thai noodles - large bowl (5-6 big prawn chunks, egg chunks, variety of other veggie chunks)

3. food packaging : 3.5/5
decent packaging. hot on delivery.

4. value for money : 4/5
bit pricey on scale. however, the quality is flawless. worth it!

--------------
1. prawns phad thai noodles :
big chunks of prawns (around 5-6) with thai style noodles. best part was the additional veggie varieties (cut in style) and egg chunks added to it made it stand out beyond just regular prawn noodles. veggies were carrot, mushrooms, cucumber, onion etc.
moderately spicy. a drink like ‚Äòlassi/buttermilk‚Äô would complement well.

2. veg greek salad :
standard fresh veggie salad containing cucumbers, tomato, black olives, onions etc. with a happy twist of creamy raita. 
the cream and raita accentuated the taste of the salad tenfold. 
true exhibition of healthy yet tasty food.

"the service was disappointing. the servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. we were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. we decided to take the buffet. we were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. the sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). the welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. had to remind them to serve one more. only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. we told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. they would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. we had to remind them to serve us more. plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. for e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - i lost the count how many times! some starters arrived only once. some veg starters were cold !! almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  main course was alright. after spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. i still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. i had it with naan and some rice as well. desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service.",2,Negative

veggies overloaded in noodles and the sweet,sour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding. it's been 2years in gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles i have ever had here. the garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable.

i would recommend this place to non vegetarians. order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!

while everything seemed and tasted good, gobi manchurian missed the spot. under impression of regular manchurian balls i ordered this meal box but got regular gobi dipped in manchurian sauce. this spoiled the whole taste as at each bite you taste gobi instead of manchurian sauce. a new way but not for me.

"#vegetarian review
chinese cravings and i found this place to order!! i will now be a frequent customer of this chinese place because i loved my food. i ordered paneer manchurian with tossed noodles. after discount i got them for 120 bucks which is a decent amount to pay for a meal for one. the quantity was not a lot but yes sufficient enough for one person.

the noodles were perfectly cooked. rightly chopped veggies in right amount. right sauces, perfectly sour. i loved the noodles.
the paneer manchurian was a little on the drier side to go with the noodles, the paneer was a bit stiff too, but the gravy was amazing.

all in all it was a happy meal üòÉ must try!!!

went to buy their sourdough bread.ended up having their mushroom soup, death by chocolate cake and key lime tart.

mushroom soup came with grilled sourdough, everything was good about it. the bread could be toasted with garlic butter

the bread itself we ended up using as garlic bread with our pasta at home which was really good. the bread is something we will go again to buy.

lime tart was better than expectation . the cream was way too much.

death by chocolate was delicious, rich chocolate. was not able to finish in one go, will have to get on it tomorrow again.

i didn't like the food at all !! we ordered thin crust pizza quatro formagio and it was not thin crust at all with very bland taste on top of that . then we had the tuna salad which was too bitter to eat . couldn't even finish it ! then we went for a very cheese pannini . another dish we couldn't finish . the bread was too thick to eat ! overall huge disappointment for me !,2,Negative
"food is amazing , had their english lamb panini , butter croissant and elderflower lemonade.
ambience could be better ..
service/staff is/are courteous..
slightly expensive ..but definitely worth a visit for breakfast.
their sour dough breads are good too",4,Positive
"happened to try the breakfast option here.it is a good place to have english breakfast.all the ingredients are cooked ,baked fresh..the breads are really soft.we ordered swiss muesli..it was delicious.however,the portion served was too less for 300 bucks..it was not sufficient for even a single person.we ordered baked spinach omelette,which was fluffy and melted in mouth.i have to say ,the taste was something i would wanna return here again for..french toast served with maple syrup was also nicely made..
taste is spot on and so is the ambience with comfy sofas.
a bit expensive due to their natural flavours and self made products.",4,Positive
"ordered tiramisu cup cake, brownie, green apple mojito and garlic bread. unfortunately, nothing was good. grossly misled by high zomato rating. wouldn't recommend this place even to my frenemies!!",1,Very Negative
"eclat has the best cheesecake in town. the blueberry topping on my cake was really fresh and delicious.
their home baked breads are also a must try.",5,Positive
"this is one of my regular hangout place. it‚Äôs a small and cosy place. the ambience is decent and it has a see through kitchen. the food served here is very hygienic. you get to choose from a variety of options. the vegetarian options are limited though. i have tried their pasta , pizza , hummus , coffee , hot chocolate , cup cakes , gelatos and soup. the taste of every item is good. the food looks very appetizing and tastes delicious. if you are searching for some cafe in gachibowli then do visit this place.",4,Positive
my all time favorite for bakery items and pizza. beats european croissant any day. try the butter croissant for breakfast. don't miss the hot chocolate.,5,Positive
"bakery items in the bread section are tasty. croissants, bagels etc. muffins are dense in texture and the icing is overly sweet. definitely can improve on those. not recommended for strong coffee seekers. if you want coffee coloured sweet milk beverages, then you can give it a try.",3,Neutral
"food is really bad. i ordered aglio olio pasta, pesto veg sandwich, quesadilla, peach iced tea and broccoli sweet corn turnover starter. the taste was really bad, not even average. they put tomatoes in everything and the bread was really hard. i will never ever recommend this place to anyone.",1,Very Negative
"what a great find. went for a late night snacking/coffee and the food, service, ambiance were amazing.

we ordered basque chicken sandwich and very cheesy panini accompanies with an iced latte. 

the chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. the bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.

the very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. it could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 

both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.

service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 

althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

ambiance - 5/5
service - 5/5
food - 4/5
value for money - 4/5",4,Positive
i was so glad when we shifted to our new house because it was so close to this place! this is our favourite breakfast place on a lazy day especially when we are hungover. the eggs benedict with salmon is my favourite. our visit to cafe eclat is never complete without eating the amazing french toast! do try it and you would cherish every single bite! i hardly have pictures because as soon as the food arrives we just attack! the one i have attached was taken to make my sister jealous :),5,Positive
i ordered from this establishment many times in the past - and all the food was quite good - perhaps unlike anything in hyderabad.  but today i wished to have the traditional fish & chips served in english and irish pubs in the uk and america.  theirs is batter dipped unlike other (sometimes more expensive) places - and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided (this is really hard  to get right in india in any case)- the result was a delicious facsimile.,5,Positive
"this place has one of the most amazing menu , great choices from pasta,burgers,breakfast option,in house made desserts and customized gelato.
 the most interesting part is that has an open viewing kitchen where we can see freshly prepared bakery items,tarts and macaroons which will leave you wanting for more . plus great hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.i have been here for breakfast and had english paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte. the quality of bread used is really one of the best.

would love to visit this place again just to try the yummy spread of desserts and gelato.",4,Positive
"i had a real craving for a chocolate and ordered death by chocolate cake and quadruple swiss chocolate cookie.
cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend trying(though it's pretty small) . death by chocolate cake was not fresh, and had that sugary texture to it. it was really disappointing.",2,Negative
"so i‚Äôve been to this place with a couple of friends for breakfast, so i‚Äôd say that their bakery items are out of the world. freshly baked and you can see the chefs preparing them through a transparent glass.
breakfast wasn‚Äôt great, would give it a 2/5
they use their own recipes and sauces.
also, most importantly it‚Äôs a big hole to your pocket. very expensive. so watch out",3,Neutral
"boy do i love their bakery products, especially their fresh bread. that whole wheat bread is to die for. 170 bucks, 3 times as expensive as one from old madras baking company, but 3 times better in taste as well.

they have a nice quiet small seating area which serves fresh continental, and desserts. i loved the quattro fromaggi, as it was made from fresh sourdough bread.

the only reason they lost a star is their high pricing on pastries (400 bucks for a cheesecake for example) and average cafe latte. but am a frequent customer here nonetheless, some guilty pleasures of life.",4,Positive
"this place serves frozen food mostly. they just reheat the food and give it you.
liked the cinnamon roll over there.
we ordered pasta and it was just fine.
and yeah it is expensive.",3,Neutral
"heard a lot about this cafe from my friends in hyderabad. located in gachibowli it‚Äôs one pocket friendly continental cafe. i tried pizza, mexican buns, sourdough bread sandwich, cappuccino and a death by chocolate cake. pretty cool stuff, kitchen has a transparent facade makes it a little uncomfortable for the people sitting in right corner",4,Positive
"this place is near to my office. it is on the same building of playstreet, next to f45 and opp to plabo. during my cousin's visit to india, we used to visit this place for a coffee after dropping their kid at play school. i would like to review about the cake which we ordered during my cousins birthday. we are around 5. ordered gluten free options like chicken sandwich, mango juice and a cake. i completely forgot the name of the cake but it is the best. ambience is good. it is bit expensive.",5,Positive
i came here with my family last month we had a burger and taste is good and good place for family and friends and pleople can bring their children...,4,Positive
"just happened to be here today. coffees are a try out. caramel and hazelnut latte are good. vanilla latte is average.
coming to starters fish and chips can be tried out. shepard's pie seems good but is costly. chicken quiche is not good at all. don't try.
desserts are good specially croissants.",3,Neutral
"situated at one of the prime locations, √©clat was an average experience. ambience is good and service was decent (guess they did not have many servers on that day). the dessert we ordered was good but the chicken steak and burger were made of frozen chicken which was extremely chewy. beverages were decent. had heard a lot about the place but overall would rate it as just 3.",3,Neutral
"this is quite a cute little cafe.. the food here is delicious although the prices could have been a tad less.. loved the french toast here.. had the chicken panini here.. the paninoli bread was quite hard..
you can see your food being prepared here...",4,Positive
my favourite cafe around gachibowli. a little overpriced but worth the taste and service. tiramisu cupcake is a must try over here.. fresh baked breads are preservetive free and really fresh..,5,Positive
"staffs were polite.
cafe is cute and small. very cozy and comfy. good for catching up with friends and date sort of.
a little over price.
could have better food menu.",3,Neutral
"went there on a sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax - as you do in a cafe. this review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once i started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! i have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are in 5 star hotels. this place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.
taste - 4 stars
value for money - 2 star
overall - 3 stars",3,Neutral
"extremely happy with the food. it‚Äôs the 5th time we have been there and the taste, ambience and service is just great. specifically srinath who practically runs it is too humble and hospitable. great service, food and ambience. don‚Äôt miss it !",5,Positive
"we ordered eggs benedict and american pancakes. liked a lot, both of them but they should also serve hash browns with the pancakes as the pancakes are small and the portion size was less. the seats were uncomfortable. they should have provided cushions in each chair, as the seats are quite deep and it doesn't provides good back support. but, food was very nice. highly recommended!",4,Positive
cafe eclat is a warm and cozy place which has quite a lot to offer for those who love dessert. the raspberry jam donut was good but the chocolate ganache tart wasn't really upto the expectation when one tart costs rs 150. overall a good place to spend good time with friends for coffee but could be little over priced if the right item is not ordered,4,Positive
"this place is located on the gachibowli highway.

i loved the ambience, food and service.

everything we ordered was delicious. it makes for an amazing breakfast/ brunch place.

we ordered a chicken sausage roll, english lamb panini and spanish omelette with hash browns.
we also had a roasted pineapple yogurt smoothie.

the sausage was lovely, and i loved the dressing on the salad. the meat in the panini was extremely well cooked.

the smoothie had a zing, and was very refreshing.

i loved cafe eclat, and i look forward to visit again, to try the rest of the bakery items.",5,Positive

"this place has been a favourite since it started. i remember the early days when it was building its repute. one evening, they were asking folks to try out their macaroons to get feedback. over time, they have established themselves as an authentic place for baked items.
their croissant is quite good. they are actually one of the few places i would trust ordering a croissant from. they also make tarts and quiches. their pasta is quite good. even their cinnamon roll is lovely. if you want good breads, they have a good variety, from sourdough to german rye.",5,Positive
"i recommend their bread. a bit on the expensive side, but really good quality! we bought their wholewheat raisins and walnut bread and were really impressed.",4,Positive
"superb quality, service and ambience.. can customise their dishes, fresh bakery and healthy salad items just makes the best place for any kind of outing..",5,Positive
"i had visited this place on a week day. we ordered red sauce pasta and lemon drizzle. it was good, but the taste was not extraordinary, i felt this place overly priced. the cafe says that it uses all kind of organic veggies and cheese, but i felt the price they were charging was exhorbant.",3,Neutral
"perfect location for your english breakfast.. everything is baked on their own and you can actually feel the taste of it.must try the gelato of any flavour.

"we ordered for a margarita pizza, a brocolli-corn puff, a spinach corn sandwich, a blueberry shake, an icy latte and few cappuccinos . apart from the cappuccinos nothing else tasted good. the bread was hard, the puff was slathered with butter, the icy latte was tasteless. the food is extremely overpriced compared to the sub standard taste.",2,Negative
"as a compulsive dessert and bread hogger, i was logically drawn towards the menu of this place. and it didn't disappoint.

if you are looking for a doughnut, please move away from those factory line produced, dense, overtly sweet and miserly filled ones. (it's about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid.) eclat's doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be. the berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth.

the new york cheesecake is one of the best i've had in terms of texture. it's rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue. i do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through.

the chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city. the key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet.

the taste of the dishes confirms the use of good quality ingredients and an understanding of the technic needed to churn out great products. keep it up.",4,Positive
"a small hygiene place with comfortable seating. the desserts and coffee are absolutely tasty :) we tried the italian bread sandwich, that was yum",4,Positive
the food is good but not worth the huge price. mexican bun - not good. it had a strong coffee flavor and was also a little burnt. coffee is average. tables and cutlery need to be cleaner.,2,Negative
"my wife loves the tiramisu here though priced higher than what i would have expected. we also ordered a pizza which was good given they make it fresh and you can see the whole process if you take a seat at the back. i liked the coffee, strong.",4,Positive

ambience: simple yet funky designer interiors. small yet comfortable sitting area.. good place for grab a coffee

food: ordered there spcl thin crust pizza

death by chocolate: its an awesome combination of choclate n cream which blow u away


overall a good place to hang out",4,Positive
"we went in as a group and it is a small place and they had to arrange the tables awkwardly. so it is definitely not a good place for groups.

the food was below par. the worst part was that the chicken starter they served was not cooked. the mushroom toast was not good too. the sandwich, burger and pizza was also below average tasting. they also didn't have bottled water.

only good thing was the friendly service.",1,Very Negative
"cafe eclat has lot of variety and their white sauce pasta is delicious. but majority of the food lacks taste, french fries lack seasoning and sandwiches are dry. moreover, i find the place way expensive for the experience offered. i would recommend to go here for cold coffee or chocolate shake.",3,Neutral
"amezing place if you are looking for a relaxed time with some food and good coffee. been there on saturday night. the place is quite and well maintained. staff is awesome with fast service. tried some desserts along with sendwich and coffee , the taste was amezing.

"i don't know why this place is rated 3.9, it easily qualifies for 4.2 and above.
we ordered a farmers omlette, masala omlette, american panacake, banana ginger milkshake and a caramel coffee.

farmers omlette was the best dish out of everything, pancakes melt in the mouth and the combination of banana and ginger just works.

"update: just wanted to make sure the cafe would know... i am reverting my rating to a 1 coz your staff's issue with the payment caused me a ton of pain now. to make a long story short.. you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe. now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card. my account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once, my card is blocked and i am pissed. truly a nightmare experience, all because i choose your establisment by mistake.

old review:
                         this place was on my bookmark list for a while and i was excited to visit it on saturday. we ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.the mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. it was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. the pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. but its a whopping 500 rupees. the grilled panini is pretty much the same.i know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. i had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. but it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol",1,Very Negative
ordered chocolate croissant for dessert but ut was horrible. a cold soggy croissant was delivered which was too low in quality for 200 bucks .. over priced and over hyped restaurant..,2,Negative
"all time favorite place to crash where one need not think twice about your health getting damaged. get the joy of genuine food, without additives and preservatives. amazing variety of breads and omelettes. thanks eclat!",5,Positive
a must visit cafe with an amazing range of cakes and gelato. they have a variety of breads to choose from along with coffee to opt. the ambience and decor are top notch. their service is good. i will definitely visit again tho the prices of the cakes are slightly on the higher end.,5,Positive
this place has got the best cinammon rolls‚ù§ everything is freshly baked. i like their butter croissant too.. coffee tastes ok. sophisticated ambience..,4,Positive
really amazing place. has vibrant and nice decor. menu is really distinct and elaborate. great people for people with sweet tooth for desserts. even coffee is really great. pasta is delectable too,5,Positive
"very interesting choice of food, so far whatever i've tried from the cheese & tomato croissant, pastries, spaghetti, pasta to the biscuits, all have been top notch. perhaps the quantity could be better but there's no doubting the quality.",4,Positive
"enjoyed the mushroom & spinach sandwich, felt that it could have had more flavours to it. chicken pasta was also ok and the side bread tasted good. liked their idea of serving water in colourful glass bottles. location is amazing and ambience is nice being a small cozy place to enjoy quiet meals with your family & friends.",3,Neutral
"menu here is very interesting and we went with lot of expectations. 

for starters ordered - chicken broccoli melt and stuffed bell peppers. 

chicken broccoli melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken, broccoli and cheese on top. the plate served to us is cold, we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw. luckily the chicken is not raw! bread is very hard and difficult to eat. overall not worth ordering. 

stuffed bell peppers - tasted just ok. but loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole. 

aglio e olio - no complaints about this one. tasted fine. 

cabonara chicken pasta - so bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this. 

quattro formaggi pizza - it is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good. so much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad. 

overall, very bad experience which is forcing me to give a rating below 3.",2,Negative
very good italian food. it has excellent ambience. loved the english cottage cheese panini and pasta arbiatta. the arfagatto dessert is amazing.,4,Positive
"a simple ,comfortable yet westernized setup which i highly recommend for morning brunch or evening snacking. its a cool place to hangout with friends or partner. it definately deserves 4.5 for the items they serve during these times of the day.
recommendation :
1. sour dough bread (if you are a real bread lover, and other different variety of breads)
2. eggs/omlette meals, pancakes are amazing if one is planning to go for breakfast/brunch.
3. shakes / coffee also gives a goodie goodie feeling.
4. sandwiches(both veg/non-veg) be it all kinds comes under safe options and they result to a good takeaway.
5. peruvian grilled chicken ( highly recommend)
quiche & other small bites are also nice trials.",5,Positive
i ordered the bbq chicken panini from another delivery service and they gave me a normal sandwich with soggy bread and stale chewy chicken cooked in bad oil. if this is what they call a panini they should probably shut down and take elementary cooking classes.,1,Very Negative
"i love this place....they have an wide array of bagels, croissants, omelette. it has prefect ambience...that of a quaint english cafe... it's sparsely crowded and my preferred place for leisurely sunday breakfast.",5,Positive
its a decent place to have breakfast but i would rather say v.expensive. we ordered spanish omelette which was not value for money. belgian waffles were amazing which made us happy. but i would say an expensive place to hv breakfast.,3,Neutral
"nice cozy ambience, good place to have coffee with friends. good finger food, however over priced. chicken quiche tasted good however quantity was very small compared to price",2.5,Negative
had ordered in for the night. was really excited to see chilli con carne on the menu. it's one of my fav dishes from when i had travelled. had also ordered 2 croissant. was disappointed with the look and tatse of the items for the price being charged. the food had no flavour at all. the croissant looked like some patty from a local store.,2,Negative
"had heard a lot about this place but this is my worst experience in hyderabad. ordered for chocolate elixir and it was big disappointment. thankfully the staff agreed to change it. the price for the quantity yey they serve is very high.the place wasn't clean, there were so many flies, not maintained and cleaned. wouldn't recommend it to",1,Very Negative
dont deliver from here. cheesecake came as little almost the half of usual size of the one you get when dined. and they dont cook properly and use good ingredients for online orders. very disappointed. not worth the money at all,1,Very Negative
"a posh cafe, not recommended for students.visit only if its a treat. but food served it great just a little costly. the death by chocolate cake was an wonderful experience for me and also the carrot cake. i loved it. i had a white sauce based pasta too. but i am sorry i don't remember the exact name. it was really really good.",4,Positive

"i visited cafe eclat this morning for brunch. despite the place being full, the service was exceptional. food tasted fresh and the ambience was lively. would love to visit again!",5,Positive
"this has been a good find! almond and au chocolate croissants were buttery light and delicious. mushroom quiche though small, was filled with umami, served with caramelised onion. their sandwiches use their own artisanal bread which gives great taste and texture. i love that their bread, pasta, pizza base, etc is all made in-house with quality ingredients and no preservatives and artificial flavouring. this is rare, and so nice! there's also some great looking fresh breads for sale‚Äî we picked one up, wrapped in paper.

there may be room for improvement with the coffee‚Äîmaybe stock some artisanal coffees from brands popping up in the country?

overall, i'd recommend eclat over a lot of the generic so-called cafes. people complaining about the price are better off visiting a cafe coffee day.",4,Positive
"we went for breakfast to cafe eclat on a sunday morning. we ordered spinach omelette, belgian waffles, coffee and gelato. everything was delicious but over priced for the quantity, especially the waffles. overall, it's a good place with happy vibes. just a little overpriced and the portions are small.",4,Positive
i thought this place was extremely overpriced for the taste and portions. very small portions and not so great taste. could have been much better! although the presentation was good.,3,Neutral
"i loved the feel of the place as soon as i entered it. though small but it's well maintained and gives you a cosy environment. give the bakery items it specialises in, the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from.

the preparation is rich, fresh and gives a good after feeling once you've eaten it. i'd specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth. the almond croissant, pain au chocolat are must try. tomato and cheddar cheese croissant too is something that was different and relishing. the hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just apt.

i'd certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too. but i'd recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders don't usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation. it's best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ;)",4,Positive
"came here on a hectic monday.
service was quick. the croissants were neatly baked and the cake pretty great as well.
i liked the part where they hand make and bake all their products. one can see the kitchen area through the windows.
the cake was neat as well and the coffee great,
this place opens at 7 am hence making it a quick stop for breakfast and closes at 10 pm so makes it a great spot at all time. 
prices are little on the higher side but it will all be worth it.
will come here again for the great food.",4,Positive

"modified the rating after the second visit since there were no salads and there apple walnut danish had more raisins than apples :( i was told that everything on their menu is out of season.

the salads here are some of the best i have eaten in hyderabad. unassuming place with great food, especially bakery products. their apple walnut danish pastry is entirely out of the world!!",3,Neutral

"i really liked the ambience. the blue cushions complimented the tables with wooden finish. the glass doors added to the elegance. the place was very calm. i had the cheesecake here, it literally melted in my mouth, absolutely loved it. one downside is that the place is a bit expensive.",4,Positive
"the first time i had something from cafe eclat was when we ordered snack-boxes for a work event. though a tad pricey, everything in that box was fresh and delicious - especially the complimentary brownie they had added.

we then went to to try out breakfast at this place. they have all the items that make a good continental breakfast, and also a variety of omelettes. we ordered the omelette meal, and the spinach and broccoli omelette. we also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter. everything arrived fresh and hot, and tasted great. in fact, i am wondering how i let go of the belgian waffles on their menu. the portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day.

the next i visited was for a midnight dessert run, and tried the rocher caramel - which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher, much like your ferrero rocher, only larger. man, that was huge and filled me up completely, but was worth every penny. 

so yes, the place is definitely pricey, but i have to say that they serve you the price's worth in taste and quality. great place with many options, so must try!",4,Positive
"went to this place couple of weeks back. wasnt too hungry so thought of having some light snacks. but seeing the price of pastry at 250 + gst, i decided against it. when you add art to your tagline, everything seem to be a bit more expensive. i am sure the pastries must be out of the world but for that nice. not my cup of tea!

had butter and chocolate croissant which were good and had a chocolate drink with mint which was average. 700 bucks for all this",1.5,Very Negative
"the spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all fresh ingredients made us drool. but we were in for huge disappointments.
they have too vast a menu for them to handle. nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. in fact the mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
we ordered their self-recommended peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. the plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! this, at a cost of rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
the chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
all in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of ""fresh"" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing.",3,Neutral
"the place is near the gachibowli flyover.
the ambience and decor is brilliant
i had tiramisu here.. it was good. though i expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu ..

you can make your own gelato in a jar here. sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine.

"with the kind of price they have for the buffet, i would call this as my worst buffet experience ever. the vegetarian people i had accompanied had nothing to eat at all. there was not even a single paneer starter. and for non-vegetarians, there was nothing except chicken being served.  we don't expect such food for this cost and venue.",1,Very Negative
"we went for a lunch with our team, and all of us were truly disappointed with the food and the service as well. for vegans, they had just 2 starters.. the food did not had any taste, it was more like just things being mixed without any skills. desserts were little better, but main course was completely disappointing, be it the dal makhani, which lacked consistency, or the paneer, which was like cubes poured on top of the gravy. i certainly would have tasted better food than this at pretty lower costs.",1,Very Negative

"where to start!! this place is really awesome. especially their hospitality, how the treat the diners is worth making a point. and this place is best when visited on a sunday. ambiance, food, pricing are all perfect. you should never minis their desserts as you'll not even have space for all the desserts in place. we visited this place on our friend's birthday and they surprised us with cute little cakes and birthday wishes. will soon visit this place again.",5,Positive

"i had the pleasure of having breakfast, lunch and dinner here at various times for an entire week and i was simply amazed to experience an entirely different level of hospitality and customer delight at this place! the staff ensure that they have a great connect with all the guests and cater to even the tiniest of the guests' requirements. i tried the a-la-carte menu as well as the buffet here and loved every bit of the food that was served. chef chinmay panda, chef abhay kumar sahoo and ms hema were the perfect hosts every time! there was an instance when the chef inquired about our food preferences and specially prepared french toast and mind blowing idiappam for us! once they knew that we were checking out from the hotel that day, they specially got us a pastry with the words 'bon voyage' engraved in chocolate on the serving dish. they even took a photo with us for their archives. i was completely overwhelmed by such a warm gesture and fabulous fabulous hospitality! best of luck to the team at feast and hope you scale greater heights in maintaining such high level of customer service!",5,Positive

"as the name goes it is actually a feast to have. starting with the food, they have a lot of variety and everything is worth tasting at least. the variety of salads is different and delicious. the main course is really good and specially the dal makhani. and all my rating goes to the desserts. they are plenty and you can‚Äôt get over each and every item. definitely a place to over eat .",4,Positive

should improve the spread
taste was okay
not great
expected a lot from sheraton but on the whole was fine",5,Positive
"one of the best buffet i have ever had. starting with the food, there is so much variety and each and every thing was super yumm. they had lip smacking main course items. dal makhani is simply best.
the best part is desserts. there is so much variety , that you can't have it all and the greed for it will not satisfy.
must try place though a little high on pocket.
and the service is also good. loved itüòä",5,Positive
"location: it has a prime location being located in the heart of financial district beside the huge icici towers.
hospitality: couldn't have asked for better.
ambiance: perfect!
food: now comes the real part, 
i went on a 10th of february 2019 and they were celebrating avengers then. people in thor & captain america costumes with desserts all being prepared according to the theme gave us a cheerful theme to feast on. the wide spread of the food with varied cuisines and live music just made my day. chat corner serving pani puri and various types of chats, fish poppers, spaghetti, biryani, tikkas, naan, roti, chicken curry and a long list of sumptuousness makes me go again. 
frills: so on that specific day, there was a photographer who clicked everyone with the superheros and gave us a print of the same, which was such a delight.

thanks for making the experience special.

"standing true to its 5-star ambience, the food gels to fit in the category of a premium outing. salads, chat, north indian, continental to south indian, this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category. there was a huge section of salads out of which bacon salad being the pick of the lot. the starters spread included hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads, farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight, live chat and pasta counters, tawa fish, fish fry, chicken starters, pork pepperoni, sauted mushrooms, chicken salami, bacon, sausages etc.  

the main course had chicken haleem which was okaish, chicken biryani which was good, mutton curry where i felt the pieces were undercooked, mirchi ka salan, veg biryani and some veg curries. the main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters. prawns and crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience. the desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth. they had a humungous spread of sweets which included chocolate burfi sandwich, mud pudding, motichoor laddu, barfis, moong dal halwa, phirni, fruit kheer etc. the pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties. overall a decent outing experience!",4,Positive

feast is one of the biggest spreads i saw in a buffet.. it has continental, chinese and indian cuisine and chats with a huge variety.. the ambiance is decent.. but probably it could be improved..

i would like first start with the desserts section.. there are many.. the very sight can be deadly to a diabetic patient.. perfect place for ppl with a sweet tooth.. a big selection of pastries, cheese cakes along with many indian specialties..

there was chicken, fish and mutton for starters.. i couldn't see prawns.. chicken popcorn was so crispy on the outside and the chicken soft in the inside.. the best starter of all.. the other starters are okeyish..

in the main course, chciekn biryani and lal maas were the best.. overall a very good experience.. üëç

the on- table service was slow.. the only thing i hope could have been a lot better..",4,Positive

coming to food, the spread was big with and uncountable with cuisines like lebanese, chinese, indian and continental. after so long i actually loved the taste of almost all items. be it salads, starters, main course and finally my most favorite desserts.

they served 18+4 varieties of cold & hot desserts which are prepared by their own and not outsourced.

"yesterday, as always i went out for family dinner. we wanted to try something new. my wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on google. as i'm sheraton/ marriot platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, i thought this would be a good choice. we booked the table. we started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. we opted to go with buffet. there is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. i did not like the food much. it was not even okay. as you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from sheraton, that was not the case here. only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. anyway, we finished our food and came back. now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. the whole night he was vomiting. and, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. we rushed to the hospital [continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. we went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. eldor son had pasta so he was good. 
very disappointing experience from sheraton. i have to think about my relation with sheraton in the future.",1,Very Negative
"a very good example of a very bad restaurant service! 
sheraton was always on my top my list but feast - sheraton hyderabad has changed everything.
to start with service is so bad here, we had to beg for serving drinking water.
the quality of food is ok and fish fry was stale.
linen napkins on the table are not properly washed or might be used ones.

to sum up, the experience was terrible and not expected from sheraton. #unhappy",1,Very Negative
"i dont even want to beg 1 star , today for dinner we visited this place and the food sounds pretty old which they were just keep on reheating. inspite of many varities hardly it was worth. my family got diarrhea i had to wake up till this late night to take care of kids who are suffered with diarrhea and all thanks to this disgusting restaurant.

updating after 12 hours - now we all four members are down with diarrhea including me and keep vomiting. feast tats really disgusting you guys are serving stale and contaminated food on this high cost. hate to visit ur restaurant. that was our last visit to this stale food restaurant. looks all of your good reviews are paid reviews. my bad i visited you on based of zoomato reviews. if anyone think its a fake comment confirm with me on 9704669785.",1,Very Negative
"went for the dinner buffet...was very disappointed with the service and food. the service here is really bad no one is bothered to attend you or clean ur table...have to remind 2-3 times for a single thing. the food is okay, taste is also okay ... not somthing i expect form luxury hotel. the desert section is good but not much variety cud have done better. not worth ur money",2,Negative

"it was a horrible experience. food was okayish, definitely not of 5-star hotel standard. the dinner buffet spread didn‚Äôt have variety. place was overcrowded and the ambience was bland. but the thing that spoiled our evening was their pathetic service and attitude. there was almost zero attention to customers. you go there and sit at the table and no one even comes and serves water or anything. no one guides or provides instructions. basically you are supposed to go and start serving yourself as if you are in some langar and not a high end restaurant. even for the bill we had to go the counter and ask thrice. definitely not a place to go with your special someone.",1,Very Negative
"the dining area is peaceful. perfect place to have conversations over lunch. hmm, but if you are too hungry you can totally skip the conversations :p 

various types of salads are available, if you are a weight watcher or you are a conscious eater :)  i went mad over the hunan chicken, it was just amazing. peri peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it. 

when i went the spread had a mix of chinese, italian, continental, and south & north indian food. 

the only thing that disappointed me was the mutton. it was a bit undercooked. it was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel.

desert, i feel they can do a lot more but i can vouch for the baked yogurt, the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugar-free.

staff are really cordial and are always with a smile on their face :)",4,Positive

"with the name you definitely expect and hope a lot but when it comes to reality, everything fails.

i had a vegetarian buffet and the spread was limited. there was no paneer in starters which is any vegetarians heart. and when i asked if they can prepare (with the huge cost of ‚Çπ1750 involved) they couldn't.

also the taste of other items is not upto the mark.

the only good thing i can remember is aaloo tiki chaat.

i would recommend you to plan somewhere, even if it's a team dinner, though mine was not!

it's not even worth ‚Çπ 500 and i am definitely not going to sheraton again!",1,Very Negative

"drinks(4.5/5)- i think tempteys and mom rule the shakes world in terms of multiple outlets on hyderabad.
look out for little app/nearbuy for offers .
shakes are good, chilly and refreshing.
my personal favorite being oreo shake.

ambience-(3.5/5) the place is cool, can hangout and can have quality talk, as it is mostly empty and most orders generally are take aways.

one thing, they should at least keep the tables clean. there were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust.

service-(4/5) they know their work, prepare the shakes well. one suggestion is to provide water to the customers, as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys don't have water.
wonder what u add in shakes!!",4,Positive
after a very long time had one of the best shakes when compared with nearby thick shakes this is lot better to enjoy better taste and this makes feel that this is what the shake is meant to be like,4,Positive

ordered a butterscotch thick shake for home delivery. good consistency but too sweet to finish the full glass. will definitely try other shakes.,3,Neutral
"we went in at 1am and yet its open. ordered custard maple shake, crushed almonds shake, choco brownie shake and potato wedges. the shakes are categorized into premium and classic and each category has lots of flavors to choose from and the taste is amazing. they have all flavors of premium chocolates like lindt, toblerone to local chocolates of india. the containers that shakes are given in could have been of better quality.
there are only two snack items available french fries and potato wedges and i feel being such a franchise they should have added more options. but the variety of toppings given makes good sense.
overall, i liked the quality of milk shakes.",5,Positive

"couldn't help but indulge my sweettooth in this store located in the dlf lane. india's first to introduce gelato as base of their shakes. you can choose your base between gelato or avalanche, which is basically yogurt based icecream.
new menu is interesting. happy to see savoury items on the menu as well.

tried coffee hazelnut shake - must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering, just the right amount and was good. it's loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips.

caramel brownie shake--- now this is a stealer. would give a 5 just for this. probably the best caramel shake i ever had. total yumminess. even the colour is drool worthy. a must try here. yes the sugar content is high and too sweet. some pampering for your sweet tooth.

peri peri fries - how interesting is it to get options for your fries, when you even love them as such. i opted for peri peri spice and it tasted good and is for someone who really like their fries spicy

tried crushers passion fruit flavour which was okayish",4,Positive
"definitely a good place for the milkshakes and some munchies.

personally i liked choco coffee hut and crunchy almond feast and the milkshakes feel so good with french fries and potato wedges.

service is so friendly and quick, even the place feels so comfortable just go and grab a shake to get your self relaxed.",5,Positive
"great shakes are kind of a given when it comes to tempteys, and this branch is no different. delicious shakes, tried the coffee hazelnut, merry cherry, and cheesecake flavours. merry cherry was my favourite of the lot.
what i did not expect were the amazing fries and wedges, we absolutely cleaned the boxes out.
service was also impeccable, really quick.",5,Positive
"beside the radisson hotel lane is one of the best tempteys outlets i have been to. i might have to get my sugar tooth removed after such sweetness overload.

the service is fast, even with constant incoming swiggy orders the staff managed to serve the ala carte customers quickly too.

must have are the newly introduced forest berry milkshake and the choco coffee hut.

definitely a good place to drop by for well made milkshakes and fries/wedges in gachibowli area.",5,Positive

the poppy corn was a nice change of pace
the cookie caramel flavoured were my personal favorite.
highly recommend this place to everyone!",5,Positive
"sunday afternoon we visited this place with the bunch of foodies to experience their new menu which has been added recently. small outlet with around 15 people can be accommodated at a time.

coming to the delicacy,
classic shakes - poppy cherry and merry cherry were the two shakes which have tried. poppy cherry was just like butter popcorn shake was decent. merry cherry was simply outstanding and loved it.
premium shakes - cruncy blue berry & caramel brownie were my favorites. these are the must tried shakes at this place.
exclusive shake - coffee hazlenut and cookie feast were delicious too. cheesecake was decent nothing that great.
crushers - orange bright, poppy corn, mint cucumber are some of the crushers which we tried but all were ok.
fries - peri peri fries and cajun spice fries were really outstanding and loved it.
potato wedges - this one was decent with jamaican dips.

overall there new menu is quite a hit and have some amazing exclusive and premium shake which is not too heavy on the pocket and tasty at the same time. as we were invited here by management for the new menu session but will visit again for sure in future to taste other shakes and delicacies.

"a sunday afternoon and desserts, definitely makes an awesome combination added to which i had piri piri flavoured potato wedges and french fries. all under one roof which makes temptys different from rest.

i in a group of 8 landed this sunday afternoon to relish their newly added shakes and flavoured snacks.

we were served with poppy corn & merry cherry as a part of their classic shakes, caramel brownie, crunchy blue & berry, mint o fruit from their premium shakes, coffee hazelnut & cookie feast from their exclusive shakes and minty cucumber, poppycorn and blue and berry from their slush sections.

the perfect shakes were: poppy corn, caramel brownie and crunchy blue & berry. poppy corn just took my heartaway. the perfect aroma of corn and it was an add on to this autumn. caramel brownie will definitely be favourites to all the chocolate and brownie lovers. honestly, blue berry flavoured desserts have become my one of the favourite pick in desserts lately.

these are must trial from here. i have never come across any shake which such an amazing variety flavoured taste.

the snacks behaves cherry on the top with piri piri flavour. someone once said you eat food first with your eyes then with nose and finally you get to taste it. these snacks surpasses everything. the potato wedges and french fries were crispy and had the exemplary colour.

worth a visit for their special add ons in the menu.

"tempteys recently revamped their menu, and we got a chance to try the additions at their gachibowli outlet. this outlet is a mere walking distance away from dlf, and easily locatable in the building next to vijaya bank.

all their shakes come with the options of 2 bases gelato (icecream) and avalanche (yoghurt). here's a list of the new ones, and how they fared.

poppy corn: it looks quite plain, but one sip, and you'll be amazed at the smoky flavour of popcorn hitting you from the sweet shake.
merry cherry and crunchy forest berry are for those who love the berries.
if you're a mint enthusiast, do try the mint o fruit shake.
for those who can't get enough of cookie shakes, cookie feast comes in with oreo and little hearts stacked on the top.
coffee addicts can try the very appealing coffee hazelnut, which was absolutely a pretty sight too!
my personal favourite, though, was caramel brownie. the flavour of caramel, with chewy chunks of brownie, and a topping of whipped cream üòç heavenly!
another good one was the cheese cake shake. it felt like a fruit cake, blended into a shake, and is good if you enjoy that flavour.
there's a whole set of flavours of slushies as well.

just in case, it gets too sweet, they have french fries and potato wedges, available in a total of 8 flavours. they come in cute little boxes, that you can probably carry away too! we tried and absolutely loved the chilli garlic, real white cheese, and cajun spice flavours.
at 89 bucks, they're quite good to be honest.
do give them a try whenever you're around!

~by invite.",4,Positive
"what i love about their shakes are they are not very high in sugar. so sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!

tried:

poppy corn: absolutely loved the flavor. you could get a clear flavor of popcorns. would recommend to try if you love popcorns.

old granola (honey loops) again amazing. one of the must tries.

berry cherry: good amount of berries, great flavor. recommended.
caramel brownie: this was also pretty good. i am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.

coffee hazel nut: this was just wow. must have for coffee lovers. they were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :d. it had a strong coffee flavor. so if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)
cheesecake (tuti fruity) : it had exactly tuti fruity flavor. didn't like it much.
oreo and little hearts (cookie feast): oreo shake never fails.. :) it was good.
blueberry slush: i didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.

mint o fruit: i don't like mint flavors at all. and was ofc minty. so not my fav. if you like mint flavors it's for you.

they have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... must try.

cheers.!!",4,Positive

"this place is located close to the hotel radisson [ 5 minutes walk ] where i was staying, so i choose this place to meet a friend. it has got a nice decor and the seating was very comfortable and relaxed. we were the only customers inside this place during our one hour stay.

i ordered a coffee latey shake [rs.169] and my friend ordered a coffee caramelo shake [rs.169]. both the shakes were really nice and thick. they are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.

on my second visit to this place i tried it's go guava shake [rs.145] and it is my favorite. it tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with guava crush.

"i really like this place for its pastries, cakes and biscuits. i see it a real competition to other bakery in the area. my favourites are bournvita cookies and pastries and also choco almond pastery. i would personally feel that their fast food or snacks could be improved in taste and the way it is served. also i personally do not like it self service scheme here. this does not mske you feel privileged as you feel when you are entering the shop. also, its announcement system is too bad. makes you feel like on a railway station. hence stars cut as these are part of ambience.

overall the products are good and one can always try them. prices are midway and therefore acceptable.",4,Positive

i had their chicken pizza, chocolate milkshake, red velvet pastry and all varieties of their chicken burgers, not one is disappointing. all the items taste good. i might specially praise their chicken cheese burger because that is my all time favorite.
they have to improve in the milkshakes department.",4,Positive

presentation- looked lovely and the gum paste flowers on it just made our mouths to water. the colour was sharp and had the perfect blend of black and white. the presentation was superb. 4/5

delivery- got everything delivered on time. nothing outstanding. 3.5/5

cake- now this is what was actually not good enough. the black forest tasted much different than any other black forest.

black forest cake- a really huge cake for a good number of people. it tasted exactly like elaichi and nowhere like black forest. a damp squib. 1/5

"usually don't get a chance to go out for lunch on weekdays, but finally got a chance with colleagues to do so after a client meeting. since the meeting was in gachibowli, we decided to try out a place not too far from ikea.
so we landed at pourhouse7 which is located above the maruti showroom.
for appetizers we started by ordering kung pao chicken, spicy black pin chicken, stir fried vegetables and also order a veg spring salad. both the chicken appetizers were excellent, the kung pao chicken was hot and spicy and the spicy black pin was a little sweet and sour and full of flavor. the stir fried vegetables was made of a plethora of vegetables which included mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, baby corn and carrots.
along with appetizers we ordered mocktails, blue sea, virgin mojito, pinacolada and ph7's special in house mocktail. among the mocktails the one which stood out was the special in house drink.
coming to main course, we ordered paneer butter masala, butter chicken and rotis. the butter chicken was delicious, chicken was tender, buttery and cooked perfectly. paneer was soft and fresh.
the best dish of our lunch was the 7h special biryani. wrapped in an omelette, the biryani was visually appealing. the rice was flavorful, chicken full of spices and this biryani was amazing.
overall we had a fantastic time. if anyone is around gachibowli and looking for a drink and good food, this is the place to visit.",5,Positive
"pour house 7 is very easy to locate as it is around half a kilometre away from ikea. it is on the fourth floor if the building.

ambience -
it gives you best of both worlds. it has rooftop seatings and an air conditioned seating. the ambience is very sassy. it is surely a party place.

food -

‚Ä¢mocktails-
i tried flavoured mojito, virgin mojito, ph7 special mojito, pina colada and sweet sunrise. all the mocktails were flavourful, beautiful and refreshing. my personal favourite was sweet sunrise.

‚Ä¢starters and salad
i tried kung pao chicken, crispy corn, stir fried vegetables, veg spring salad and spicy black pin.

kung pao chicken: the chicken was well cooked and most importantly, it wasn't bland. the spices were just right for a person like me who prefers spicy food. the dish also included honey so it tasted slightly sweet which took the dish on another level. üÜô definitely a must try!

spicy black pin: it was kinda similar to kung pao chicken but was grilled and wasn't sweet. it tasted nice.

crispy corn: it was sweet and crispy. presentation was on point. üëå

stir fried vegetables: the vegetables were cooked properly and the spices were complimenting the vegetables.

veg spring salad: it was very tasty and healthy. the coating of the salad was bringing the best taste of the veggies.

‚Ä¢main course-
i tried chicken alfredo pasta, sicilian pizza, paneer tikka masala, naan, butter chicken and 7h biryani.

chicken alfredo pasta: it was creamy and absolutely delicious. the chicken was very well cooked. loved it!

sicilian pizza: it was loaded with veggies and the amount of cheese was okay. i'm not a "" too much cheese"" person so it tasted good. also, you can ask the staff to put more cheese.

paneer tikka masala: it was spicy and flavourful. the paneer was soft and tender. very well made üëå

butter chicken: the chicken was tender and juicy. the gravy was very rich. loved it‚ú®

naan: perfectly madeüëå

7h biryani: it had lip smacking flavours. the presentation was on a whole new level.üëå it was enclosed in omelette. the chicken was flavourful and the basmati rice and tender and tasty. highly recommended!

all in all: 5/5

pour house 7 is definitely my go to place now. üôå‚ú®",5,Positive
"so this place is located near ikea above the maruti showroom, gachibowli been to pour house 7 two days ago& was really good it's an excellent place for party lovers & foodies i had the best time the ambience where it has both indoor and roof top seating and loved the rooftop seating started off with it's delicious mocktails like mojito,pina colada,sunrise

"here is my review!

location:-
very easy to locate, it is very near to ikea, a prominent landmark in hyderabad. its on the 4th floor, also rooftop option is available in the evening time. 

ambience :-

once you enter the pub, the interior will blow you away. the unique point about ph7 is the view it provides through big windows of the hustle of gachibowli and high-rise buildings around.

food :-
i tried lot many things here ! here is the detailed review of every item:

mocktails:
-
ph7 special mocktail- it literally holds the name! the most colorful mojito i ever came across, the flavors will tickle your taste buds!

blue sea- its so beautiful to look at! the blue shade darkens down the bottom which contains lichi cream and makes this mojito special for sweet lovers.

pina colada- you might wanna skip this one, i found the flavors not complementing each other.

flavored virgin mojito - most recommended drink for hot summers. refreshing, minty and relaxing !

salads:-
stir fried vegetables- the main thing about the salads is its seasoning, the taste of the cooked veggies was so good. they could go a bit less on the oil though.

veg spring salad- it gives you the authentic taste of the vegetables, the dressing of the salad and spices used makes it tasty!

main:-

butter paneer & roti- i prefer paneer curries to be spicy and buttery, and no doubt they nail it! its pretty heavy, i was almost done with 2 rotis.

sicilian pizza - the pizza was stuffed a lot with toppings, cheese was a bit less. you can mention to add more cheese to make it better. it was okay overall.

crispy corn - the presentation of the dish was unique and catchy. the taste was anyway a bit different from my liking, as i prefer it salty n spicy, and not sweet. could be my own preference. you can still try it out.

overall:-
pour house 7 is the go-to spot if you're around gachibowli and are hunger-stuck! i would surely recommend this place. do try out in the night-time and enjoy the rooftop :)",5,Positive
"crazy place guys....very small and middle of non residential area and top of a residential place.
dj with ipl...it was crazy, i was there with my boss, he loved it but it's bit crowded.
limited imfls and staff was good and humble.",5,Positive
"the food was good and the ambience was good too.
pradhan helped us in getting the food sorted and was always helpful.
the starters and main course was better than what we expected and the servers were helpful.",5,Positive

one of the peaceful places to hangout with friends... open terrace and the staff is amazing... food is good too... hope you come and visit this place.,5,Positive
a decent place for party and a cozy climate too. veg manchurian was great and chicken kebabs were fine. first thing that disappoints me is there is no drought beer and the most annoying thing was the behaviour of the manager ‚Äòakthar‚Äô. there has to be some respect towards the guests and the managers was bossing everyone around. i‚Äôm giving this a two star only coz of him else i would have given a 4 maybe if i had the drought beers.,2,Negative
"nice food and drinks, maybe they can add some more to the menu. it was ladies night the day i went, enjoyed, very friendly crowd... suddenly we all made a big group and danced our hearts out. cheerful comfy place... would go there again.",4,Positive
"been to this place recently along with few of my friends for lunch and we had a good experience. the food was delicious ( only reason to give 4 star rating ) but the staff were so neglected to us ( at our time of visit ).

"we visited this place today. a decent rooftop place with good ambience, ipl screening, okayish food and dj. the service is a tad bit slow, giving a resemblance of a place not visited often. though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season, the place bore a deserted look!
dj was good and adapted according to the crowd.
we started off with butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn. both of them turned out to be very oily. we further ordered fish tikka which was okayish. masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change. they wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne.
if you are in a group and want a place not heavy on ur pocket, can opt for pourhouse7.",3,Neutral
i visited this place on friday with my friends..the roof top view was awesome and loved the food and drinks too....the staffs were very polite...will visit again very soon,5,Positive
"average ambience , average food and average experience. not worth the 500 bucks they charged for entry as cover which was not even adjusted with the bill. music was too loud making it difficult to sit through. a number of items on the menu were unavailable though service was prompt. had high hopes because of the zomato rating but was thoroughly disappointed. should give it a miss if one is looking for a classier experience.",2,Negative
"one star only because zero star is not an option.
probably one of the worst and slow place in hyderabad.
only one bartender/waiter who was not even in the bar for most of the time.",1,Very Negative
"walked in during happy hour and was shocked to know they had very few drinks available, and out of beers. and when asked, the service staff had no clue. all they said was ""no stock, it may take an hour or more."" sad!",1,Very Negative

the rolls filled with chicken and full of veggies were deeply fried. the taste was amazing and the crispness was on point. and served with a sweet & spicy sauce dip. must try out.

great nawabi pizza:
the pizza was loaded with cheese, chicken and veggies. and the taste was great but the presentation could have been better.

tangadi kabab:
chicken drumsticks marinated in aromatic indian spices and grilled to perfection which were really amazing in terms of taste.

these easy onion rings are double dipped in a batter that is seasoned to perfection. the crust was crisp and the onions were tender and sweet served with hot & spicy sauce.

overall my experience @pourhouse7 was really amazing. thanks to the staff for offering great hospitality.",5,Positive
"i chose this place because a friend of mine recommended and i was pretty disappointed with the sluggish service as it was not even standard.
there was just one bartender on a friday night, which really escalated the waiting time. service on the food section was even slower. as the fries ordered at 9pm were served at 10pm. i was extremely displeased.
if you want visit pourhouse7 then i would suggest going only for dancing and that too only if you can tolerate the high base.",3,Neutral
"place looked good when entering but that was it, it went downhill from there. it took three people from their staff one after the other to confirm what we had ordered and it was only one dish. we had to wait for 25-30 minutes for the order only to realise they had served it to somebody else. this was when there were only 5 tables occupied. the staff seemed inexperienced.
the toilet's location is just bad. whenever somebody opens the toilet door the whole place stinks up like piss.
we just gave up on the place and left paying for the drinks that they had managed to serve.
the owners and managers really need to look into the problems.",2,Negative
"pourhouse7 is a spacious roof top bar that offers great ambience, paranomic views of the cityscape and prompt friendly service.
everything is in our budget.
there are several classic mocktails.
this is the place mostly for the partying on weekends.

the food menu is good here.
they have new dishes with new receipes.
i went here with my friends for lunch.

we had ordered so many tasty dishes like murgh lasooni kali mirch tikka it was soft and good in tasty. they served it hottt.

after that we ordered crispy chilli fish it was good in taste and somewhat the taste was quite sweet.

my favourite is classic chicken spring roll yummy in taste and i just loved it alottt.

then comes the great nawabi pizza who doesn't love pizza, it was good in taste served with green chilli sauce.

tangadi kabab was tasty. we had hot hot then n there while they served us.

pesto rice with chicken stroganoff .
the rice was soft it was good in taste especially the chicken stroganoff was best and it tasted good with the rice.

onion rings with hot & spicy sauce. it was something new here. the sauce was spicy and good in taste.

this was our lunch menu for 4 people.

then comes a dessert. we ordered the brownie with ice cream. ice cream was good but the brownie was little hard though it should be soft.

apart from that everything was good here...

best place for partying on weekends with friends
you'll enjoy it with a good music and dj's play list.
only on weekends you'll find dj's playing songs and music over there.

overall it is a good place to visit....",5,Positive
"hopped into this place around 9 pmish on saturday!

roof-top, pleasant atmosphere and ‚Äúok‚Äù crowd.

preferred drinking a full bottle than sipping on shots along side ordered for corn kernels, chic lollipop, malai broccoli as accompaniment to the alcohol and all were indeed severed on time, tasted good too.

this place is a newbie in town (or maybe i am wrong) however, i got to meet an old pal who was playing on sets as the guest dj for that night there.

music played was electronic & bollywood.

shall return sometime again!",4,Positive

* moroccan chicken sticks- grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and other spices! they were smoky and appetizing. ( 4/5 )

* jhinga nasheela- prawns marinated in indian masala and grilled! it was crispy and medium spiced. ( 3/5 )

* bruschetta- slices of sandwich bread are topped with veggies & cheese and baked! they were seasoned with red chilli flakes. honestly, it wasn't even bruschetta in the first place! give it a miss. ( 2/5 )

main course-
* 7h special chicken biryani- basmati rice cooked along with pieces of chicken marinated in indian masala! the entire dish was covered with an omelette that was topped with fried onions. it was truly unique in terms of both taste and presentation. highly recommend the biryani! ( 5/5 )

* spaghetti aglio e olio( veg )- spaghetti tossed in olive oil along with black olives, garlic and chilli flakes! it was appetizing. ( 4/5 )

* great nawabi pizza- pizza topped with chicken tikka, veggies and mayo! although the toppings were generous and spicy, the base of the pizza was a serious let down! it was hard. ( 3/5 )

* alishaan chicken s/w- pieces of chicken, lettuce and other veggies along with mayo are sandwiched between two grilled breads! served along with fries and salad. it was just okay-ish. ( 3/5 )

drinks
so we tried a few mocktails( about 5 ) and honestly they were bad! the only saviour was virgin mojito.

the staff are polite and friendly!

"went to this place a couple of weeks back owing to the buzz in the city about this place.
we started off with haryali paneer tikka whixh was extremely tender and juicy
the other vegetarian delicacies we had were chilly paneer and bhutte de kebab . loved the kebab unexpectedly. recommending that kebab.
butter garlic fish was something differently exquisite. it was topped with gravy and when you eat a piece it was crunchy. its very tough to do that,kudos to the chef.
nazakhat kebab and mutton mazedaar were kind of favourites because of their awesome taste.
for maincourse we had the 7 h biryani. it was delicious biryani full of chicken and masala covered totally by an omelet topping.
the crispy onion rings and its special sauce were the showstoppers of the day. totally loved it.
for desserts we had the caramelized brownie with ice cream.
highly recommend this place to everybody.",5,Positive
"one of the beautiful rooftop party places in gachibowli and in the vicinity of hi-tech city.

been here last weekend and tasted some of the sig ature delicacies.

roof-top had a beautiful ambiance and a beautiful skyline view of high rise buildings in the surrounding.

started off with some exotic colourful mocktails. mocktails tasted good but they lacked that fizz! informed the same to the manager who was polite to take it as a feedback. chocotina shake was superbbbb!

starters which i really liked were, 7 house crispy fish, chicken majestic and paneer ke sholay.

fish was juicy and crispy on the outside, and tasted so good with the spices that were coated.

there was this burj khalifa onion rings appetizer, which was innovative and was best with the sauce that it came with.

they have special biryani in their maincourse which was worth having.

great nawabi pizza was with trying. also,nonveg pasta in white sauce.

choco brownie with vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun with vanilla icecream were in the desserts.

overall it was a good experience. place offers corporate lunch and dinner packages. good option for people who are looking for corporate parties lunch and dinner.",4,Positive
"today i visited this place called pour house 7 in gachibowli.the place has indoors as well as rooftop seating.the rooftop seating gives you a panoramic view of the area and is breezy and well lit.the indoor seating is more of like a party space which will be ideal for small to medium sized groups.coming to the food it was really mind blowing.we tried a bunch of items and majority of them tasted great.lets have a look at the items we tried starting from mocktails to appetizers and main course and ending it with desserts.
firstly we had tandoori malai broccoli which literally surprised me.who had thought broccoli could be that tasty....it tasted amazing with a creamy taste to it.next we had crispy chapa which is basically crispy crump coated fried fish with curry leaves seasoning which gave it a unique flavour.this was an outstanding dish and all of us loved it.morrocan chicken sticks was our next item and this one was also pretty good.the chicken was slightly smoky with a good amount of spicy seasonings on top.the chicken was nice tender and juicy too.i love seafood and so i ended up ordering a jhinga nasheela...this tasted good but nothing extraordinary about it.it was just good that's it.we also had chicken nachos which was served in a big bowl with lots of cheese and salsa and the right seasoning.loved it.we also had a bruschetta which was average.along with these we also ordered aalishaan chicken sandwich which i would say was not at all aalishaan.this was not good.it lacked the right amount of chicken in it and was overall not tasty.next we had a nawabi chicken pizza and it was really good.the topping was great with lots of chicken and cheese and was true to its name but the down side of the pizza was its base.the pizza base was really hard and dry which overall brings down the dish but i still had it because of the amazing topping.we had a platter of fish fingers and fries and it was excellent.both the fish fingers and the fries were good.
after devouring all these starters we could only go for two main course dishes and so we decided to go for the special 7h biriyani and spaghetti aglio-e-olio.i am in love with their biriyani.it was not like any other biriyani that i have ever tasted before.it was unique and it was excellent too.it has a completely different flavour from all the other biriyanis in hyderabad and i could not guess what's the secret ingredient was.the spaghetti i would say was decent but was definitely not among my favourites.
now coming to the desserts we had vanilla ice cream and gulab jamuns.i would say the dessert section does not provide for much choices.the jamuna were decent.
we also had some moctails in between which were not up to the mark.they need to improve their moctails.the only one i felt was perfect was the virgin mojito.other mocktails we had were not good.we had some litchi based ones and orange based ones and also a pinacolada flavoured one.but we did not like these much.

overall i would say that the place offers really good food and the ambience is also great.the drinks need immense improvement.thats it folks.this was my review of the place.hope you like it.",5,Positive

"march 15th : had to change my rating to 1 today, the worst service ever. my table is right across the bar and no one cared to take an order till half an hour. the staff doesn't know a thing about service. tables are unclean and stick! as usual the stupid dj is soo loud but it got better later. poor maintainince of the place adds to everything. i literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order. waiter is so absent minded. imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins.
the poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people. some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place. there was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing. it was a really pathetic experience and i would definitely choose a different place next time.

special mention to dharmender, who was very attentive.
i haven't tasted much of their menu, but the white sauce penne pasta was average, i expected it to be more flavorful and have consistent creamy texture but it wasnt. the chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks. the only thing i liked about the place was that it stocked kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places. the seating could be arranged better, seats weren't that comfortable and i keep hurting my knees everytime i make a move. the music/dj was exceptionally loud and not pleasant at all ! if you can please get the dj to reduce the volume at least during peak dinner hours, i couldn't hear anything my colleagues sitting across the table were speaking!",1,Very Negative

we visited this place for dinner. the weather was freezing cold, i was craving some hot soup.
we ordered chicken manchow soup and lemon coriander soup. the soups were perfect for a freezing cold evening.
comming to the mocktails the virgin colada, chatpata madness and sex on the beach were very soothing.
starters were delicious we had
hyderabadi tawa fish which was so much flavourful.
lahsuni paneer tikka was so smooth and melting in mouth.
tandoori broccoli was my favourite from this place.
main course was really gud.
finishing with the desserts the hot chocolate brownie with ice cream was too tempting and sweet.

"at gachibowli we have a new rooftop dining place which captures the astonishing view of hyderabad‚Äôs new side overlooking the mighty ikea. we dined at pourhouse7 where they house a club too at the floor below the rooftop.
.
it was drop dead gorgeous view from there and the weather was cold with chill winds so we had to put our jackets back on. but on a regular evening, the place would be warm. they have been serving us some nice cocktails and some punchy mocktails like chatpata masala.
.
the starters were not that great and needs much improvement. they had chicken manchow soup, and coriander soup which were really bleak and the place won‚Äôt be expecting much orders on them as it‚Äôs a bar. the hyderabadi tawa fish was exceptionally great and turned out to be my favourite of the night. in the vegetarian department i‚Äôll recommend tandoori broccoli ü•¶.

further to the main course the tangadi kebab was perfectly cooked juicy chicken legs. the masalas of cashew nut chicken and chicken tikka were soo tasty. they were an amazing combination with the rotis. the place has improve a lot on a handful of starters and rest will be taken care of.

"after hearing a lot about this place i got a chance to finally visit this. as once reaction was ""wow"" but that went away pretty soon.
right from the entry there was a confusion. we did a booking through dine out for 8:30 pm which didn't really make sense as the table were not blocked. to figure this out we have to wait for 20 mins for the manager to come. when asked about the reservation, manager was totally rude and said to my wife that ""she should be happy that she got a table"". i mean wow, it was an eye opener for us.
and at that point i realised this is one of the mostly badly managed places.

no doubt its huge with good lighting , ambience and dance floor but the service is pathetic.
the food is average and costly. nothing great in drinks. prices are all on a higher side. 
we just got a drink and a platter and left to a much better managed and a calm place.

there is no point making such a huge place if you cant manage and talk to customers nicely. not really sure if i would like to visit this place again even though its a hot property right now(now really sure why)",1,Very Negative

"the new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its usp.

i went here with my team on friday night and booked upper deck for the same. the place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in hyderabad. the light system and other props were good. it reminded me of club octagon in gangnam, seoul. overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups.

food is just average here. starters like paneer tikka, baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy. main course was also not upto the mark.

worst thing i experienced about this place is the service.
i asked person attending us to start the main course at 8.30 pm. to which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready. it would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm !! this really pissed me off and ruined whole experience.

"prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space, and rightly so.

the place is located somewhere in financial district, after you take a turn from the lemon tree hotel. i pretty much had no clue about where i was exactly, and the almost stranded road is of not much help. until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word prism inscribed on it, though conveniently covered by the bushes around it. another 100m or so, you reach their parking yard, and finally the enter the premises after it.

a huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena (for a lack of better word), that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor. the place has high tables next to the dance area, and then some couches on the far side. there is a beautifully lit up staircase, that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating.

and that is just one part of it. they have an outdoor seating, where the projector is put up for the match screening, and doubles up as the smoking zone. apart from this, they have a pool, which would be apt for a private gathering.

i am no club expert, but their light system is sure one of their usp. the dj played majorly bollywood that evening (it was a wednesday), and did a decent enough job.

while the place is all decked up pretty well, the food on offer didn't impress me much.

üî∏starters

üîπburmese roll with sweet chilli dip: a bit too oily, they were okay to munch on. they could have done with a bit more filling, though.

üîπpunjabi paneer tikka with mint dip: failed to impress. the paneer was too rubbery in some places, and in others, too charred. the lingering taste was merely of chilli, and nothing else.

üî∏mains

üîπprism special veggie lover pizzaüåü: the dish that fared best with me. it was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese. for the price, it may seem a bit costly, but quite worth it, as compared to other dishes.

üîπspaghetti: their take of spaghetti aglio olio, with mushrooms and black olive toppings. this was also decent.

üîπpenne alfredo: this was just regular, nothing good or bad. and this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread.

i didn't find the indian mains anything great, and needs to be improved a lot.

the dessert was another downer. chocolate truffle was all goey and just cream.

from the mocktails section, i chose the safest bet go crazy. it was a twist on the oreo shake, with the inclusion of kitkat, but it wasn't great either. lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake.

if you are looking for a party place, that has a happening setup, good crowd and amazing ambience, this is your best bet. but for the food, it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas. they would give you the best value for money. the alcohol is also a little pricey, but you wouldn't mind that in a place like this.",3,Neutral
"by invite

the pub is located in the financial district in gachibowli, the pub is currently the largest in hyderabad in terms of area. as you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music.

the pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights. the ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs. the usp of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of led rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this.

there is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor.

coming to the food:

punjabi paneer tikka (rs. 325):
thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base. was not soft and requires lot of improvement. a strict no to this dish.

burmese rolls (rs. 275):
a different kind of spring rolls filled with corn, garlic and cheese. the taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip. the only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily.

mains:

for the mains we had exotic vegetables in black pepper with rice, the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn't have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it.

prism special veg pizza:
the thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served. the pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either. the pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders.

apart from these we were also served veg pulao and meloni tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped.

drinks:

cucumber coriander mocktail: the cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet. the flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander.

go crazy:
the blend of oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake.

recommended dishes:

burmese rolls
prism pizza (if you need a main course)

the place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life. so is not recommended.

"emerging as one of the best clubs in hyderabad...............for those who love partying this place is indeed for you.

plus points:-
1. great space
2. utilized well in terms of inner area, private section, seating's, lighting, dj console, outer smoke area and swimming pool space for mini party gatherings and very important parking.
3. dance floor is great, unless in lot of clubs its get so crowded and claustrophobic.
4. bar counter looks absolute great.
5. barmen showing all juggling skills, is eye candy experience.
6. good varieties of drinks but they can improve on that part a bit.
7. few good finger foods get you sorted for your party plans.

minus :-

1. food wise they need to improve as it's normal nothing special or different and price wise it's not that competitive.
2. staff over here need bit of training in terms of hospitality, being rigid spoils the mood. a cute smile can change lot of things.............:-)

starters :-

chicken lahsooni was good, garlic taste was evident but overpowered which is a good thing, served with mini papad rolls and chutney. burmese rolls is something which i relished with corn and green chilies with some cheese stuffing it got in my favorite list. fish fingers was too was decent enough. pizza was good too both chicken and farm fresh pizza as toppings were loaded, but make sure you have it hot or warm as you like. they certainly need to improve the pasta and paneer tikka. 

all in all a great place for partying and events organised by prism management - don't miss them at all. monday to thursday they mostly play bollywood and commercial hits. corporate crowd is regular as lots of multi national companies are in neighborhood. friday to sunday they have different themes like electro, techno and edm so all those partyholics have a blast at this new place in hyderabad.

happy partying guys...........................:-)

"an evening well spent at prism club and kitchen. the place is situated relatively outside the main city in financial district and has a huge area to offer. one can enjoy poolside as well as at the sitting which is offered near the dance floor. with big live screens and a great dj, there is a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place.

started my food experience with their appetizers. i tried out their punjabi paneer tikka, fish finger, lehsooni murgh tikka and veg burmese rolls. the punjabi paneer tikka was good. it had an exquisite flavor to it which was top notch. served along with onion salad and traditional mint chutney, one can give this dish a shot. next up, their fish fingers were quite normal for my palate. they could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option. 

my favorite dish of the night was their lehsooni murgh tikka. it had a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flakes to it and was super tender. the spice mix was really complimenting the chicken and is a must try for you all. veg burmese rolls was a big disappointment for me. it had some extra oil to it which could have been clearly avoided. they need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the rolls.

for their drinks, i tried out their cosmopolitan, margarita and passion. all the drinks were simply wonderful. it was truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drinks at this place.

for mains, i had their exotic vegetables in black pepper sauce with rice, farmer chicken pizza, penne white sauce pasta. exotic vegetables in black pepper sauce was good. i usually don't like to have this at most outlets due to the overpowering taste of the black pepper sauce but somehow these guys served it very well alongside some rice. their farmer chicken pizza was too good. loved the overall consistency of the dish. a slight work needs to be put up in their pasta. i didn't find it much cheesy and tasty. 

the place setup is quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food. great place for partying for sure. happy eating. :)",4,Positive
"such a pathetic experience i had in this place. 
first, i called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 pm on a sunday. the person who received call on behave of prism stated that it is open from 6 pm. once we reach there by 6:30 pm, no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now. the way they spoke to their customer is really annoying. ""i don't know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but, as you came early i am considering you and giving a table"". is this how low they treat a customer? 

secondly, when requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available. the manager or a person with attitude told us ""no, there are no seats available""(in a bold manner). when i checked from zomato there are plenty of tables available. i got pinched with irritation. though, i felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends.

finally, me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer. and then, mosquitoes came into picture. there are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no ac has turned on. out of frustration, we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered. they said, it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes. i was like ""wtf"". i asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place. such a disappointing experience it was. i suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well.",1,Very Negative

"it really been long time i have visited this place late review was busy with work
the place has got good dance floor... it has got many areas in it indoor... pool area ... garden area....
visited this place for event hilight tribe booked a vip pass entry ... from book my show app near the entry they taped a band our wrist after entering into the prism the managers over there and bouncers over there didn‚Äôt allow us to enter the area which was up , saying it‚Äôs full than okay den make us seat some where they where like stand near the bar counter it was so annoying we paid some 3000 rupees for vip entry per ticket and they don‚Äôt allow to vip area and say to stand near bar ... dan we asked the manager two give table he said u have to pay 10000 per table ..... i said it‚Äôs not mentioned in book my show app tat we have to pay for table and ur not allowing us to go up to vip area ...what is this he was like ur wish madam dan i said see we r all gals u should at least allow us to enter vip area he was again like full dan we got really paronoid .... seee gals need safety we just can‚Äôt be in common crowd he didn‚Äôt understood tat also dan we had to make a call.... hope u understand dan we got a table after a calll so cheap f these managers there....
than we got our personal waiter too after d call
my question is what about a common people who can‚Äôt make calls and get the work done so better develop ur managers if u have taken money for vip let d crowd enter into tat area if u don‚Äôt have place don‚Äôt issue tickets mention in book my show about booking a table separately for the amount make sure u serve the people for what u have told

the drinks and food was not that great it‚Äôs over priced compared to other top places in hyderabad

every one earns there money with hard work so the owner of the place plz do think f the common crowd u charge but provide dem for what u have charged hope u understand and make the changes

"this place charges both an entry fee, and a cover charge. we ordered the wasabi prawns - what they delivered was great - but i tasted no wasabi so our order was clearly wrong. the cinderella mock-tail was insanely sweet, no one at our table could finish it. despite promising us for over an hour to find us an indoor table, they sat us outdoor with the mosquitos which they weren‚Äôt able to control with citronella sticks. the dance floor was very active with an amazing dj, though not nearly enough ac so it smelled like sweaty guys.",2,Negative

"so we had gone here in a group on a weekday and the overall experience was good. the main attraction was the huge space and the lights which already set the mood. the dj was awesome even on a weekday with a mix of hollywood and bollywood songs. the taste of food was also good. the only problem we faced was the tat for each order. we had to wait for like over 40 mins for each order to arrive. also, there was a discrepancy in the bill which we realised only the next day. so better be careful before paying the amount. also, the prices were little on the higher side. happy partying!",4,Positive

wow! it is amazing!! the place is huge and ambiance is too good. i guess one of the best party places in this part of hyderabad. altaf is at his best. he took us around and showed us a nice outdoor place. karthik attended the table. he is an amazing guy. his service is impeccable. he suggested mongolian chicken which is very fresh and tasty. usually food at clubs doesn't really match the restaurant quality. but this is too good. will visit again sometime soon.,5,Positive

"big on ambience, food and music. miserably fails at politeness.

called up this place to reserve a table for two on a friday night. they said please walk in. no reservations required for two. the place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation, and the ones remaining were well ‚Äúabout to be reserved so you can‚Äôt sit‚Äù. if you‚Äôre less than three head to the bar because that‚Äôs exactly where they like pushing everyone to.

the service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied .

the place is all lights and show and great for nightlife. the food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front.",3,Neutral
the place on outskirts in financial district. have visited this place on february 1st dj suketu 1st friday of 2019 with office team. the property is huge as you enter the club. there not much seating for crowd as i have heard its biggest club in hyderabad. the food was tasty and service very quick even after they have huge crowd. the staff is polite and helpful.. dj suketu was awesome he played superb bollywood tunes. it has a seperate smoking zone outside which is good. overall its good experience.,5,Positive

food is okay but i feel it was over priced",4,Positive
"pros:
awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen.
cool ambience.
they always have the best djs.
cons:
too much vip culture. almost all the tables are reserved. it's almost impossible to get a table. you are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the vips. even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. after paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

but hey if you love dancing, there's no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this.",4,Positive
prism it is!! one of the most happening club in the pearl city... amazing ambiance with a pretty huge dance floor which you cannot stay of out off bhoom!! must visit place with a bunch of gigs! bar counter is set up at its best.. good food for sure! has a pretty big smoking zone which doesn‚Äôt make you suffocate lol! must visit for sure with ya loved ones.. ‚úåÔ∏è,5,Positive
"i have been on friday night and reached at round 10pm.
it was almost full we hardly get space for standing.
they occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead.
we could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood.
i must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group.
dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent.
zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising üòÇ even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people üòâ.",3,Neutral

"i went to this place for lunch with my mom and dad. the ambience is quite decent, with a lot of seating places. we ordered chicken coriander soup, golden fried prawns, a mixed fried rice and a plate of dry chilly chicken. golden fried prawns were a bit plain, it could have been more flavourful. the soup was good. fried rice and chily chicken were good in taste. all costed us around rs. 1400. it was a light and good meal. i'd like to revisit this place again.",4,Positive

in short, horrible service.",2,Negative

"ohh finally the wait is over, i have been seeing this restaurant from quite sometime and finally i am at dine o china. from outside it looks good. i got flat 50% offer from dine out ""that's exciting""..

first thing to try was chicken tom yum soup.. ohh it was one good tasting soup i had for a while. and then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn.. it surprised me as well.. never seen this in a chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was horrible.. battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere.. with my experience i would call it a piece of &#-+.. it was all crapy.. and when i asked i got the reply that the chinese chef has changed... and they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn.. it was ok for my liking..

now we have ordered

 chicken drumsticks

shezwan chicken dimsums

singapore noodles mix

chinese chopsuey

yang chow rice

schezwan chicken

to sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks. 

dimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy.

singapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles.

yan chow rice was good

so was schezwan chicken.

experience was decent i would say specially with the offer i got.. flat 50% off.

a loud shout out to the dine out team ..

i would wish to come again if i get such offer .. but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant.. please try and make some change as we have very less chinese restaurant nearby.. 

thanks",3,Neutral

"it was a date with my girls who wanted to eat chinese so we decided to go to dine o china for the simple reason that it is close to home and it turned out that we chose a super place to have chinese.
the restaurant is located in gachibowli and is easy to drive to from orr and has a proper basement parking so no issues even on the busy gachibowli road; for me it is a major point of concern if i am driving on my own so at least parking was sorted.
we entered the restaurant and were warmly welcomed by a stewardess who took down our order and served us. it felt like by the women for the women. it felt comfortable that is all.
the seating arrangement is quite comfortable and i particularly liked the chairs as they were so comfortable. we ordered chicken drumsticks and honey chilli potato for starters and both the dishes were awesome. kids liked the chicken drumsticks and finished the plate. they were juicy and done to perfection and my girls told me that they were fresh also. honey chilli potato was crunchy and sweet and chilly just like it should be.
for our main course we ordered veg dimsums and chicken dimsums and mix chinese chopsuey. both the dimsums were tasty and the wrapping was quite thin so you could taste the filling which was quite substantial. but i would recommend that you have dimsums with the sauce that they serve with honey chilly potato. i find it tastes better with this chilly sauce rather than the sauce that they serve with dimsums.
the mix chinese chopsuey has a mix of egg, chicken and seafood and the girls told me that they liked the taste of it.
for dessert we tried chocolate fried ice cream which can be given a pass as i didn't like it that much.
infact we liked the food so much that we got chilli garlic noodles packed for dinner also. and also the girls could not finish the chopsuey so we got it packed and will now have it in dinner.
we liked the place very much and once the husband gets back to hyderabad we are visiting this place again for sure.

pity zomato doesn't give me chance to review the place on my second visit. like i mentioned we would come back to this place we went there yesterday afternoon for some snacks and got some dinner packed for ourselves. we tried chilli garlic fish, kids' favourite chicken drumsticks again, chicken satay and lemon chicken coriander soup and veg talumein soup. all of which was great.
we asked for crispy chilly baby corn which turned out to be too salty and on complaining the stewardess served us a fresh batch which was quite tasty.
definitely a must visit place. will be back again when i am craving for some yummy chinese food.

second they provided custom menu for zomato gold and asked to get free drink only from that menu. zomato gold and this restaurant is not good as they keep changing conditions and we customers suffer. zomato says you can get free dish from complete menu and

"had a terrible exp on saturday night (22nd sep). i have been quite regular to komotos on friday eve woh my office colleagues and had good exp so far. tonight i recommended this place to my friend for dine out.

when my friend arrived the staff at the kitchen told there is no ala-carte tonight. only option is buffet. so they started with buffet. when i reached it a little surprise to me and i checked with the manager there mr. abhiveer. he also denied about the ala-carte. so we continued with buffet later while walking around the buffet spread we learnt that ala-carte is also there and three ppl lied to us. as i am a big fan of their hamas and pita dish i asked for the menu and mr. abhiveer is sayin we don‚Äôt have menu, please check the menu in zomato. what? who the hell ll publish the menu only on zomato in a restaurant and are the customers fool enough?

buffet food options for vegetarians are very less. their dessert spread was good though.

their service was also pathetic for the indian bread and other stuff. after asking numerous time for spoons and tissues, this is how the tissues were served to us on the table (plz refer the pic). we had 3 kids with us, imagine how long these tissues would have been their in this manner! üòÄ

big no to ppl if you want to have just one or two dishes there. we got trapped today.",1,Very Negative
"this place is love. it's your everyday bar.
this place not just welcomes regular customers but make the leave a mark, literally. you'll find name plates of it's regular customers all over the bar. and their bartenders absolutely know how to keep the customers happy. this is one place where you will find more people sitting at the bar, rather than the regular seating arrangement it has.

sonu being their star bartender, you'll find almost everyone calling him out for their drinks and he absolutely takes care of all his regulars with a smile. we usually order a whiskey sour and sangria, being our absolute favorite. accompanied by crispy corn and their signature pizza, which is baked fresh out of their jonathan's kitchen.

if you're a party animal you'll find this place a hit on thursdays where they take their ladies night very seriously. all drinks on the house.

i'd absolutely recommend this place, if you're looking for your next regular bar.

went there after attending a comedy gig and this place continued the fun.
the band ""aatish official"" were rocking that day. never heard the better band then them in any pub in hyderabad. i dont have words to praise them enough.
coming to the food , it was delicious and the quantity were sufficient.
staff was good and took care of us well even though the place was crowded.
the only thing to be improved is that the manager n bouncers should be able to handle the drunk persons better. there was a group of people celebrating a birthday but they were all over the place. they were disturbing the band and also other people just couldn't get on dance floor. thats the only thing due to which i am not giving this place a 5. hope it doesnt happen again when i visit next and also hope ""aatish official"" are there when i come.",4,Positive

"komatose on a sunday night is the perfect place to be, happened to be drizzling, which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas.

inside was a pretty small area for a bar, but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above, overlooking the area below. lighting was funky and great, the vibrant colors adding to the vibe. üíì

being a big bunch, we ordered different drinks and luckily i got to taste all. the most special of these were from 'the 7 deadly sins of koma' menu. the taste was as described on the menu. lust in particular was something different i'd never tasted before, a chilli-spiced vodka, strawberry infusionüå∂Ô∏èüç∏.

the appetizers we had we're really good, something i enjoyed more than the alcohol.
dragon prawnsüç§, grilled pomfretüêü, peshawar chapali kebabs are some of the must orders! didn't quite like the nawabi shikhampuri. while all the items tasted great, i felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.

best for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush üçπ.

the service was professional and quick. would've wished for better music, and there was no dj at the music station. however we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great! it's a perfect place to watch a match screening, have a party, or if you're in the mood for it, go into 'comatose' üòâ.

the drinks i liked where virgin mojito, lust and gluttony. all of them were quite different from each other and tastes really well.

"no option to give zero or less.. visited the place with friends during the happy hours..

food and drinks: friends has opted for whiskey and myself has ordered for mocktail, requested for less sugar syrup , which was not honoured at all... food portion was so less that a kid can gulp it at one go.. some of the items were reheated and served..

the biggest surprise came along with bill , they thought the group was drunk and no matching to the number of drinks ordered vs billed.. serious integrity issues.. we called them to correct which took good amount of time, least bothered to apologize or explain.. no go place..blocked the place..",1,Very Negative

tried greed among the cocktails which had the base of whiterum , brandy along with lime and orange, one of the 7 deadly sins of koma. among the mocktails had blackcurrent , lime and peach and also green apple(prepared on request) which were cool enough to have. among the starters we tried fish , chicken , prawn dishes. overall a very nice experience .",5,Positive

"few weeks back, after a tiring day out, we decided to spend the evening at komatose. choosing to sit outside, we got to know that they have grill and chill saturdays. the live music for that night had been set outdoors. the weather being fairly pleasant, it was good to hear atish dole out melodious numbers one after the another. got a request? he would be more than willing to fit it in!
coming to the food, after a long time i had a great paav bhaji. this was part of the live counters there. i hasked for some extra butter on paavs, to which the cook readily complied :d
another live counter had paneer and veg rolls. tried the paneer one, and liked it. for the mains, you have a lot of options to choose from. do give the pizza a try.
the desserts are another wide spread. you find both desi and fancy desserts. i tried the blueberry cake, kiwi mousse, fruit cake, orange cake, brownie, burfi ‚Äî everything was so well done!
all in all, do visit the place on a saturday, to have a gala time.

"well next to jonathans kitchen is this place to down a few.
komatose is a good crowd puller, with plenty of weekend party groups and people from nearby it companies.
the team at the bar does a phenomenon job. their interaction with guests is over the top, no wonder i heard of people visiting this place almost every day of the year.

also, from my experience, this is one of those few places where the sound acoustics are so well designed that its loud yet comfortable. you will not come out with a sore throat.

the food comes from its sibling jonathans kitchen, so we know it can never go wrong. about the drinks, well what could go wrong with them ! ) and oh ! did i mention the cheese chilli toast.. its different.. try it..

the outdoor cabanas can seat about 8 ~ 10 people each, wonderful for the evenings.

great music with shows on specific days of the week.

"this place is located in khajaguda. it used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. i used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.

food is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. however there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.

prices have been almost doubled . i used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. i believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? i believe their main usp was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and moti mahal have lower prices and better ambience..

with hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..

hope the management would rethink..",3,Neutral
"this review was long due. located on the khajaguda road this restaurant claims to be part of the gachibowli cluster and when i asked the owner he said he was just on the edge of gachibowli and, therefore, technically they are in gachibowli. the place has good parking and nice natural setup which has still been maintained despite the recent road construction.

coming to the food we went for the gulaabi chaap after checking on google, unfortunately this is the only place in india that offers this dish and we had no clue about the dish until we got it. simply put it was amazing, mild rose smelling chicken cooked in the tandoor and served with mint sauce. it gave a heavenly feeling. next on the list was the chicken momo which was soft and fresh again reminded me of some amazing momos i had in manali. i hope some day they make mutton momos as well.

butter chicken was by far the best in town which went very well with another amazing bread called the malai warki paratha. it was soft and was melting in the mouth with the butter chicken. seemed like a match made in heaven. much said about the main course we went for their version of special biryani. as is known from my reviews i don't eat too spicy food and this was just the perfect spicy level one could ask for. it had boneless pieces of chicken pan fried and served on top of the biryani rice. the taste was good and to my liking. our vegetarians friends were enjoying their daal makhni and paneer butter masala which was again good and their veg biryani as per them was equally good.

thanks to the friendly staff we went on eating for close to 2 and half hours without feeling the time passing by. the large projector added to the aura of the place and we enjoyed the ipl on the large screen. they offered us a 20% discount and another 10% on our next visit apparently one of their limited time running offer. thank you aromas@11six for being such a good host and an amazing food. we shall be back again.",5,Positive
i've ordered chinese nonveg combo from this place ...it's basically veg fried rice with chicken manchurian gravy....the foods aroma was awesome.... however the vegetables were undercooked and spoilt the taste of the food... however i really liked the food...it was flavourful..will definitely order from this place again,3,Neutral
the location is not so okay. i found that most of the people weren‚Äôt there. the quantity of the chicken biryani we ordered was a lot. the chicken starter is also tasty. must try biryani but prices should be reduced.,4,Positive
"i did not like this place at all. this restaurant do not match zomato gold standards. first thing , the price and ambience do not match at all. this place looks like a shady dhaba from highway but prices for food compares to ohris restaurants.

even if we ignore prices , taste and services are worst that i have encountered in any zomato gold restaurant.

this place do not deserve 4+ rating. totally disappointed.

"have visited this place few times last year. this is a decent dine-in joint. the food you get here is a normal indo-chinese food, which any chinese restaurant would serve. if you want vfm, go there and dine-in. have always felt that the quantity of takeaways are less than dine-in. the picture is a quantity you get for 320 bucks dish!",3,Neutral

food is awesome in terms of taste and quality and quantity also.aromas special chicken briyani must try item in menu of you are biryani lover.
only one thing service is very slow because of love kitchen.2 hours for lunch or dinner
place is small but good",5,Positive
"food tastes good here but when you see surroundings around kitchen and wash area it was horrible. cockroaches, mice and lots and lots of dust. i understand this place is for online orders but not for dine in given the fact that people dont get to see this unhygienic atmosphere.",2,Negative
went for a birthday party...it‚Äôs a small restaurant with simple ambiance...food is really good and you must try it once...got to know the story behind the name and its pretty interesting and inspiring...staff is politely and courteous...,5,Positive
the prices are hiked and then discount is offered. basically the discount provided by the restaurant is kind of a fraud and they try to fool people.,1,Very Negative
"a beautiful calm place to settle down and have food. liked the ambience. had ordered mutton rogan josh, kadhai paneer, butter nan, hot n sour soup. must say they have really maintained a great taste for whatever they cook loved all d dishes we had ordered mutton rogan josh was d best till now i had in entire hyderabad kadhai paneer was surely an authentic kadhai paneer with whole spice taste coming from d dish soup was also upto d mark and also liked the behaviour of the staff really well behaved. will surely revisit the place again.",5,Positive

"this place started as a great place initially, but in recent times the quality and quantity have been reduced.
one of their best dishes "" sarson ka phool"" is the best example of this category.
you need to go back to your basics else you will loose the customers slowly",3,Neutral
"i have been ordering from this place for a long time. they are fantastic in terms of following any specific instructions you might have when you order via swiggy or ubereats. the food is as described, there is no overdose of spices or oil. the menu is varied. i have tried chinese and tandoori dishes from here, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. this is my first choice when we want to dine in. my favourite dishes from here are chicken lababdaar, kafuli and chicken afghani.

i took away one star from the review as there are rare issues with quality control, like tandoori kababs were once a little burnt.",4,Positive
"this place is tough to find. due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. don't go by the pictures.
food is average. few items very bad mainly their special biryani. oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
it is not so happening place.
their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

p. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby.",3,Neutral
great taste and always have been consistent with the quality of the food been served. zomato gold members can enjoy 1+1 and its worth it for the price you pay and the quality of food they serve.,5,Positive
"i have ordered today veg cantonese pan fried noodles, both noodles and soup are not at all good. noodles not cooked well. soup has too much of corn floor and unable to eat. total parcel went to garbage tin.",1,Very Negative
"food: ordered crispy honey chilli potatoes, kafuli, shaam savera and naans, everything was spiced appropriately. kafuli was less spicy and shaam savera was good in taste nor too spicy nor too sweet, a tangy taste of tomato gravy.

service: a little bit slow as there were only few tables occupied but i think they have just few staff members.

ambience: it has indoor and outdoor seating both, we sat indoor where a projector is mounted and songs were played. ambience is overall very average.

value for money: great. it is actually cheaper than we expected for the quantity and quality of food it served.",4,Positive
"3.5 by me. the food was quite good 4.5/5 for taste. we ordered paneer achari tikka and paneer butter masala, both of which were quite good, nothing to complain about. the butter rotis were a little overcooked but ok. service was also good. points deducted for cleanliness as the outside area was infested with fleas so wasn't able to get the dhaba style experience (with benches and lanterns which made the outside experience desirable), the inside seating was good tough.",4,Positive
"tasty food but expect less quantity compared to price.
it is on the middle of kajaguda to nanakramguda. not crowded and big. very small restaurant.",3,Neutral
"ambience: not great, by seeing photos we expected more out of it but it didn't match our expectations. it was dark and sort of out of order too.
rating : 3/5

food: we reached here just to have sizzlers as we wanted it and could find only some on the list being this one of them. we took sizzler again it was not what we thought of it was just about fine. then we ordered panner tikka and something in non veg starters. starters were good they grilled properly baked properly proper taste. we ordered some curries and naan again the main course was just about fine not great. overall we only liked starters here.

service: it was bit slow we had to wait for quite some time for getting our order at one point we thought that maybe they are outsourcing the food also üòÖ

"review no 514: 
 
in my recent visit to hyderabad, i was introduced to aromas@11six. while the name sounds interesting, but i was not able to find the reason behind their name. 

our teams in hyderabad have been ordering food from here for team events etc for quite some time and hence when we ordered food from here, i was keen to find out how they fared. 
 
here's what we ended up ordering over a few days from aromas@11six 
 
gosht rogan josh: what a beautiful preparation of spices and meat. the meat in specific was cooked very well and the spices were also within moderation. i usually get scared with the spice level in such dishes but aromas@11six got it absolutely right with this dish. 
 
butter rotis: even when they were delivered to us at home and as well in the office, they were warm and soft. nothing beats such a meal on an unusual cold hyderabad winter evening. 
 
paneer butter masala: the quality of the paneer used was excellent. the quantity of the gravy and the paneer pieces were adequate. i loved the consistency of the gravy and the balance in the spices used.  
 
dal fry: again, in many instances i have seen how it can go easily wrong with this humble dish. thank you for serving this up well.  

paneer biryani: on of the days, i could not have non-veg food and ended up ordering their paneer biryani and it was filling to the core. the quality of the rice and preparation was nice. thank you for not being stingy with the paneer. 

see if you can check for some good combos on popular food app portals. that way you can try this great dish and club it with something else as well. 
 
price: in line with the competition. they have tie ups with some of the popular food apps and hence sometimes we end up getting a good deal. 
 
service: they have ensure we always got our orders within the stipulated time in spite of the rush in the orders (especially during dinner time). 
 
ambience: we have only done take aways from here and hence going to leave this neutral. 

here‚Äôs the final ratings basis my experience at aromas@11six. i‚Äôm going to hold back a bit on the ratings because they have depth in their menu and i would want to try them out more and perhaps revisit my ratings again in the near future.:

food: 4/5 
price: 4/5 
service: 4/5  
ambience: 3/5 (our review has been based only on home delivery and hence keeping this neutral) 
***************** 
overall: 4/5 (implied rating of 4 on zomato)",4,Positive
i wish i had a 0 star option for this.we visited for the first time and it was a very unprofessional way of having food there. the service was although fast but the food was terrible. we ordered apollo fish which was not at all worth eating and the mushroom starter itself gave a unwilligness to eat. the main course we ordered was murg and veg kolhapuri which absolutely had no salt in it. the restaurant couldnt even provide lemons to us even after requesting multiple times whereas they had cut lemons for finger bowl. a must ‚Äúno‚Äù to this place.,1,Very Negative

"horrible first time experience. i would never suggest ordering or going to this restaurant. they have absolutely no regards for the customer satisfaction. i ordered food from this restaurant and after first accepting my order they go ahead and decline it after an hour. when i called the restaurant they say that it was the zomato delivery guy declined it. i called zomato and they say that the restaurant never responded to their call and so they had to cancel it. i called the delivery guy and he said that the restaurant told him that some one else picked up the order. i am not sure who is at fault here but i had a horrendous experience overall. so, i am not going to order or go to this restaurant again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone for their pathetic customer service.",1,Very Negative
i didn't visit the restaurant yet.. but ordered chicken biriyani here.. but that's not a biriyani.. that's a just cooked basmati rice with chicken 65.. they're calling it chicken biryani.. pathetic..will visit restaurant once..heard otherwise about sea food here.. and update my review then,1,Very Negative
i ordered mutton biryani and it was very bad..worst quality mutton biryani you can eat . the pieces were all leftovers small bits and it felt he gave all leftover . on telling him to replace...reataurant told let them check it ...but then nothing was replaced . one should not prefer this restaurant as quality is now degraded . extremely bad and horrible service .,1,Very Negative

"ordered chicken kolhapuri via swiggy and the experience was top notch . the gravy is to die for.. spicy, succulent.

this is the best and spiciest chicken kolhapuri i had in last 2 years.

it appears it's slow cooked and boneless chicken is then dipped in the gravy.

the aroma was fantastic and was feeling great having this curry.

i can still feel it in my mouth... kudos to the chef

"were there for my friend's birthday party as the place is nearer to her. it's a small place with around 6-7 tables, with only two stewards. service is good as the place is not so crowded at the time we went.

had manchow soup which can be much better. lipta mushroom isn't that great, mushroom isn't fresh. there's no crispness in the crispy corn. egg biryani is good. overall not satisfied with the food much. even pricing is little high, in comparison with the taste and quality.",2,Negative

"totally overrated
just avoid this place unless you wanna loose your money for a cheap quality food

and the place looks like some forbidden house",1,Very Negative
"the ambience was good. we 12 ppl went there for dinner. some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with kadai murg. for starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. for biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. they told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. but the rice was sour. with biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. may b they tried to compensate. one of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 rs.
and about the service, it was good till we pay the bill. frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app. but they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept. atlast though they agreed. overall we weren't satisfied at all.",2,Negative
"best place to eat near my office.
food is really tasty. the staffs are polite.

the owner himself is very friendly.

the service is a bit slow.
the tandoor items are really nice and their special biryani is really good. the best thing is that it won't cost you much.
not at all overpriced.",5,Positive
i ordered kadai veg and methi malai paratha. both had a lot of soil particles and we couldn't eat either of them. on my previous experiences i really appreciated the food and highly rated the restaurant for the same dishes that disappointed me this time. we ended up ordering from somewhere else since the restaurant didn't act on my prompt complaint.,1,Very Negative
"nice little place , hard to locate though. this is near to lanco hills in manikonda. the food here is really good and the staff is very attentive. the ambience is not so great but good for small family dining experience. this place had gold and we had ordered one starter, one biryani and one kulcha. all tasted good. and the bill was around 450 bucks .

can try it if you want someplace light on budget.",4,Positive

the mutton gravy was pretty good too along with chicken biryani.
among the chapatis , malai methi roti was really really nice.",4,Positive
"went to this place just because it's listed on zomato gold and i must say i am pretty impressed with the whole experience over there. we have ordered paneer majestic nothing extraordinary about it was good. later we have tried bhami goreng, veg kolhapuri, butter naan and murg biryani. bhami goreng had very unique different flavour/taste which i liked. same thing with the curry and naan both of them were really good. special mention to murg biryani it was amazing.

nice good,5,Positive
"if you have no value for money then this restaurant is good to waste your money. reason for giving 3* is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends. but, we, non-veg guys were totally disappointed for non-veg curries. it's got no taste at all. chilli chicken gravy was like saucy-saucy. no spicy at all. butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be. it tasted like wheat flour and not maida.

service- good
taste- below average
ambiance- good
cost- high",3,Neutral

very very bad. the food was not of good taste and quality as well. it‚Äôs like throwing money in water. just some fancy names they have kept for dishes but the standard aren‚Äôt even like for petty shops. in fact after having the food both me and my husband have got food infection. pls close ur shop instead of making people sick.,1,Very Negative
"situated a little away from the main road aromas serves quite good indian as well as continental dishes including chinese and thai food. the cost of all the dishes are at the lower side as compared to the other restaurants. it has an average interior with both indoor and outdoor sitting. though the service here is not so good but the food covers it all. i really liked the taste of the north indian food that it served. it has true north indian flavour. i loved gulaabi chaap which is a betroot kebab. lehsuni dhaniya murg , sholay kebab , malai warki paratha, kastori kebab are the other tasty and aswumm items that i tried. undoubtedly it comforted my taste and was happily back home .:)",5,Positive

went for a north indian dinner! the place is a little out of way. the ambience is okay. it looked more like a college hang out place. there were only 2 people managing the counter and the tables. however the food was really good. decent place for lunch or dinner and easy on the pocket as well( especially if you have zomato gold)!,4,Positive

we ordered mutton haleem and chicken fahm mandi half for two people. there was no chicken haleem.

the mutton haleem was delicious. i feel this is the best haleem i had. taste- 5/5

in frame - bbq chicken mandi & chicken juicy mandi",5,Positive

have always been a fan of the shawarma of this place. therefore wanted to try the mandi as well. but was utterly disappointed with the quality of rice being served. by no means it seemed to be mandi rice. it was more like pulao rice. considering the price that i paid the quality was no match for it. mandi rice is never sticky but in this case it was. kindly look into the image and you will understand.,1,Very Negative
i like this place for shawarma but mandi was pathetic. it contained pulao rice. full sticky no cashews. really not the kind of mandi i was expecting from this place. really pathetic mandi,1,Very Negative

food taste - quite good and worthy
ordered chicken wings mandi and barbeque chicken mandi, chicken is tender and tasty, rice is flavourful and quantity is great.

i tried chicken mandi made in arabian there will be badam and kissmiss garnished on that which is open ur taste buds. chicken wings and kurbaani ka meeta are also lovely dishes to try when ever you visit that restaurant,4,Positive
"we were 2 friends wanted to eat some mandi.. i know some is not the right word when it comes to mandi.. with that huge plate and all.. so yum yum tree is a great place to eat mandi. it was around 2o clock in noon when we visited..the place is very calm and not on main road but its easy to find.
ambience is spot on arabic, songs played are romantic. the guy who served us had a smile on his face all the time he's serving us. nothing to complain about the place at the same time nothing to praise too.
we ordered bbq chiken mandi and grill fish..
grill fish was oki dint like it much but my friend loved it.. she likes fish may be thats why!
bbq chiken mandi was amazing i can place them in top 5 mandis in hyderabad..! trust me with a lot of mandi places its a tough to be on top 5...bbq chiken pieces wer juicy and very flavour full...they give you mayonise and chutney to go along! prices are very pocket friendly...you can visit with family, friends or girlfriend. its a perfect place for mandi.. definitely going again!",4,Positive
a gem and must try hyderabad restaurant. the ambiance to sit relaxed and enjoy with friends plus the unmatched pleasure of getting high on briyani. i tried the mutton mandi and it was extremely tender and flavourful.,5,Positive
"the place gives you a feeling like you are having food at a royal arab resta, the food here is aptly cooked but the required seasonings are not provided(fried onion which are main in a mandi) and also i have seen them filling tap water in the bottles and serving the same as bottled water , so watch out at last you can rate the food at 4/5 , seasonings 2/5, ambience 1/5 at last it is a great place to go with family and friends",3,Neutral

"have been here once. the staff was courteous and very friendly. overall the theme was perfect and sets the arabic mood. i think they can work a bit more on offering more choices, felt that the choices were limited apart from the mandi it is known for. limited veg options too.",3,Neutral
ordered grilled tandoori and to my surprise i have got 2 neck pieces for one chicken...must be an alien!!! such a pathetic taste of food that i am never going to order from this joint again,1,Very Negative
"i just wonder how people praise the food and service.
maybe the day was different for me but i was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. we asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. i hate such late servings.
mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. instead i find it better at other places.

ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. however the choice of music could have been better.

this place is absolutely amazing. from the classic mandi to their other dishes. the food here gives you a taste you can never forget. tue ambience just adds to the beauty that this place already is. the waiters were very polite and helpful. loving this place a lil more with every visit.,5,Positive
this is a small place on the 6th floor of a hotel. not a lot of options for veggies. the mandi is brilliant. we were about 10 of us and got a chance to try a lot of starters and they were all good. the flag bearer at this place is the mandi. you need atleast 5 folks mop it. service is good and the food is not very heavy on the stomach. don't miss it,5,Positive
awesome food. been there with my office colleagues for lunch and had ordered half veg thali and falafel. the half plate is enough for 3 people at least. the food was yum suitable for the name and lot of crowd. would love to visit again.,4,Positive
the place don't have mutton though they have it in menu. chicken mandi is ok ..not that great.ambience in contrast is great. music is too loud to have conservation in lunch.,2,Negative
"had gone out with friends for a midnight craving and had the mandi, it was served on a huge plate and the seating was so perfect for us to help comfortably finish off the entire dish. the rice was very flavorful and we were able to taste the ghee and cognitive milk in every bite. a great place for a feast!",4,Positive
"the place is a bit isolated but the food and ambience is quite good. even one of the best place to have the arabian mandi. give a visit for sure, i would say.
fahm mandi - less spicy
barbaque chicken mandi- if you don't mind having a bit spicy. my personal favourite it is.",3,Neutral
"my first mandi dining ever. but as the name says, the food was yumm.

we ordered half special veg mandi and chicken bbq mandi. the mandi is more than enough to fill three people and the cost is reasonable.

the arabian theme ambience looked warm and inviting. the add on point was the seating arrangement",4,Positive
"this branch is in one of the interior areas in the hitech city.

ambiance: the ambiance is rich and has good feel and better ambiance compared to the other branches

food: we had the mixed mandi platter which is like 1k+ but really huge with good variety of chicken grill, tandoori, mutton, french fries, etc.
the rice is also fine and is accompanied by good amount of fried onion and cashew nuts and other sides like mayo and tomato chutney.

we also had the teriyaki burger which was not upto the mark of the long lost taste of the original yum yum tree.

"as the name says: if you want to checkout the yummy arabian food in hyderabad, then this your place.

the ambience is very spacious and resembles the arabic style of interior decor and seating. this also has camel prototype placed in the entrance.

if you're a hater of sea food, you will start loving it after eating the grill fish tikka from here.

food we tried here:

chicken bbq tikka
grill fish tikka
chicken arabian mix mandi

all the 3 items that we tried here are the best of it's kind. chicken bbq tikka is the best of the grilled chicken that i have tried before. grill fish tikka comes with a single complete grilled fish without any bones. it just melts in your mouth and if you try it with white mayonnaise it tastes the best.

chicken arabian mix mandi comes with arabian mix grill platter. it's comes with a combination of chicken tikka, chicken wings, grill fish tikka, chicken bbq tikka and mutton.

this was the best mandi i ever had. it has rice cooked in arabian style with kaju, kishmish and fried onions sprinkled all over the rice. this combination of rice with grilled non-veg tikka gives you a foodgasm. and also it easily serves for 4 to 5 people if you're on a very high appetite.

service here is really good and cost is reasonable for all the items. so if you're planning to try arabian food in this city of nizam, then do try this place.",4,Positive
"tasty food.. mandi and deserts.. both veg and non veg
everyone can hop on wd family n friends.. and parcel options also available.. goo(ddddddddddddddddd",5,Positive

"visited yyt with my family for friday dinner. was longing to have mandi for long. the restaurant is located close to q-city amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. the d√©cor is simple yet beautiful. generous staff. we ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. good place for get-together. request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area.",3,Neutral

this branch of  yum yum tree is on the gowlidoddi road a little further from the q city building. this place is known for the mandi they serve but i thought of trying something other than mandi and so i  ordered the chicken jumbo burger which had a generous amount of chicken and mayonnaise. the burger tasted good and it was quite filling. this place isn't harsh on your pocket.,4,Positive

"as the name, so is the food.
the food is really yum. as mandi is the most popular food, we tried two options.

special veg mandi and chicken bbq mandi.

both were extremely delicious and mouth melting.

especially the aloo tikki slices on the veg one gave an amazing crunch.

the service is decent and staff is super supportive.

food is cold.. n not even tasty,2,Negative
"awesome arabian food joint ... your search for mandi should end here for good. calm and serene place on the 6th floor, has ample parking space as it is within gated community. went out for family dinner menu is not huge but has something to satisfy everyone‚Äôs taste buds provided you are a non vegetarian. for starters tried the fish grill and lebanese juicy chicken. it was one of the best fish dishes i‚Äôve tasted in town, i‚Äôm particular about my fish, not much bones or fins, should not
smell bad and should be cooked well, all 3 criteria was a tick with a wonderful flavour and the accompanying mayo sauce was just perfect. high standards set with first dish, expectations were only growing as we waited for lebanese chicken , it was just juicy , cooked well and was fresh and tasted great. so a 5 on 5 for starters. now moving to the the attraction of the day, the mandi it was authentic middle east preparation, with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments, ordered juicy mutton mandi, mutton quality was above par, mandi was great , if you are a spice lover, mandi is not for you. ended the day with baklawa which was usual.
recommend must try place for mandi",5,Positive
"not worth the hype created, the service is not worth the cost. many dishes from the menu was not available saying we're not serving indian food. when ordered cold drink they gave 500ml bottle and paper cup, for a restaurant of this level you expect proper glasses for drinks. the taste was okay but the rice quality was not what i get in paradise or other biryani place.
my first mandi experience in hyderabad was not good.",2,Negative

owner and staff are courteous",4,Positive

p.s. don't get flabbergasted by the looks of the mandi

verdict : not recommend, skip.",2,Negative
"the best part about this place is ambiance and seating arrangement, very unique in style and an enjoyable experience especially when visited with friends/family.
we have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa.

people go here to have mandi, the dish that they are meant for. we too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters, chicken tikka and chicken wings, of which the former was palatable.
we had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food. five of us were unable to finish it off, rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated.
the feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing.
their service deserves a special mention, they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise.
overall this is a must visit to have mandi.",4,Positive

"was here for a club party.

so, this place has an amazing ambience with dim lighting, well equipped furniture & a large lcd screen & the light music just makes it perfect during a cricket match.

well, coming to food, i opted for a veg buffet. the starters tasted really good specially the cheese garlic bread & ghee idly.

we had enough dishes in the main course & there were mocktails being served whenever asked, raspberry tasted the best.

deserts weren't that great. vanilla scoops were just fine.

overall, it seemed like a great place to hang out with a large crowd & also alone (yes, for those cricket maniacs, you can just get yourself a beer & relax).

either ways, it seemed at its best with proper space, lights, music & yaa, privacy.

i would rate:

the ambience was good. the service was way too slow and the staff was busy watching the cricket match on tv i guess. the food was below average. one of the server didn't inform what we have ordered for pepper chicken and later the person who took the order in the starting came and he was telling that we did not order after 15 minutes of telling the other server. such a poor coordination and very slow service. not at all worth the price.,1,Very Negative

"tilt is one of the most popular places around gachibowli for team lunches and chill out evenings. the ambiance is quirky and funky that would appeal to youngsters. theres live music, sports screening. the window gives a n amazing view of the hitec city traffic.

we started with a mango mocktail called mango festival which was the best mango drink i've tasted.

cajun spiceed chicken was heavy on cajun spice and did not taste anything else.

cheese broccoli was an amazing dish. both cheese a d broccoli were fresh and were perfectly cooked.

the cilantro fish was another great starter where in meaty basa chunks were marinated with coriander leaves a d cooked to perfection. no fish smell....that's it. it's a hit!

they have some interesting items on the menu that one wouldn't expect at a place like this.

ghee fried idli was a surprise and was amazing! highly aromatic d spicy idli pieces that just fill your mouth with flavours.

peanut salad. similar to roadside peanut chat that we get, in a fine dine form. the quantity is great and you just cant stop eating it.

in the main course, i ordered lamb chops. the chops were big and meaty but they could have been cooked better.

the grilled fish with rice was again an amazing dish with fresh grilled fish a d flavourful rice.

in the desserts, cheesecake didn't impress me. they should start baking it.

however the choco lava was a stunner. probably the best choco lava in the city.

overall a place with great food but ambiance could have been better.",4,Positive
"the food and ambience are average . in starters egg fish and chicken are sort of better . corn and all other veg ingredients are not up to what you expect it to be and moreover the main coarse is the worst to have . the desserts are decent and the fruits are the best .
i would not recommend a buffet here because the money you spent here goes down the drain think before you go. the moctails they serves was the worst .",2,Negative

tilt european bar is a unique bar in hyderabad that serves a variety of imported beers. while the newly opened micro-breweries struggle to serve good quality beers consistently, tilt fills in the vacuum. it was interesting to note that few of these imported beers are brewed by the trappist monks. also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !

we tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing belgian kreik, chamborlette, la trappe witte, dubbel, erdinger weisbier, erdinger dunkel and schuimzuiper. of these we liked the dubbel, la trappe witte and the erdinger dunkel. they also serve a variety of mocktails, our favorite ones were mint mango and after glow.

their food menu compliments the beers very well. in appetizers we liked the cajun spice grilled chicken, zesty chicken wings, cilantro grilled fish, cheese broccoli and guess what, spicy fried idly ! we were not expecting spicy fried idly to be on the menu but when we tasted it, we understood why this was their most popular appetizer. we loved the chicken wings, they were at their juiciest best.

in the main course, we were served grilled fish with veggies and lamb chops with rice & french fries, both the mains were great. in desserts, we had the blueberry cheese cake and choco lava cake. while the cheese cake failed to impress us, the choco lava cake was finger licking good !

we ended a wonderful lunch session with shots of smeets waffle jenever, it has a brilliant sweet after taste of belgian waffles, a must try !

overall tilt european bar is a great place to hangout with friends over some great imported beers and delicious food.",5,Positive

went for a team lunch. service was very good with staff being courteous and prompt in serving food.

we opted for buffet which has decent number of options for both vegetarian and non-vegeterians.

an ideal place to hangout with friends on a game night enjoying the drinks and food.",3,Neutral
i really don't like the place much . the prices were too high . small area . just don't like that much. the music was not upto the mark . and the place was dull,3,Neutral
"hands down the best beer in town üç∫love their cherry beer.
ghee podi idly, butter garlic mushrooms, noodles are my favorite appetizers here !!",5,Positive
"the place is good but not for non drinkers. they are not willing to pay any attention towards non drinkers. almost all staff members are concentrated at drinkers table only. in short, not a good place for non drinkers.",1,Very Negative
food taste is good. customer service also good. ambience and music also nice. cool place to hangout with friends. overall it's very good.we enjoyed.,5,Positive
"food was good but they need to look into quantity which they serve. quantity was quiet less.
mango mint cream is the must try drink of this restaurant.",4,Positive
"been here with my buddies, meeting after few months...!

place and ambience is too good...!!!
i would love to hangout there again... probably with the same bunch of buddies again..!!

service is good too. this place mentions the % of alcohol content for every drink. anyone who wants to try to have alcohol for the first time this place is of course a good start of it.

i would recommend non vegetarians to go to this place because i don't find veg tasty here..! but thankfully i am a pure non vegetarian..!!",4,Positive
"i went there last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience. the place is on the second floor and you can view the traffic near the biodiversity park junction. it's not very crowded either and thus you're able to get a good amount of attention from the staff. they are courteous and efficient and if not sure they do check and come back with the right response.

they have a good variety of tap beers. we initially tasted the chambourlette, la trappe witte, schuimzuiper and erdinger weisbier. chambourlette is very mild, slightly fruity too, la trappe witte was smooth, hada flavour of some good fresh spices and no bitter after taste, schuimzuiper was a little bitter and erdinger weisbier was very mild. the obvious choice for us was la trappe witte.

for food, we ordered nachos, chicken wings and schezwan paneer. nachos was okay, basically it lacked topping. it looked as if the cheese was applied using a brush and the toppings were more like a garnish. schezwan paneer was amazing, the paneer too had actually soaked the taste of the spices and was wonderful. for main course we ordered veg hakka noodles, which was again prepared well and the noodles too were quite light.

the ambiance of this place is okay, the music is at the right volume and doesn't make you yell to talk. the place however is very dimly lit that your eyes strain while reading the menu as well. but overall a fairly good place to hangout with friends and quench your thirst.",4,Positive

it‚Äôs too mundane to be a weekend place",4,Positive
"‚Äú must visit for tap beer‚Äù

went here on a saturday evening for a couple of drinks and this place didn‚Äôt disappoint.

the place is a dimly lit bar scene overlooking the biodiversity park signal, not crowded when we went there. we got ourselves into a table with good view of the city.

we tried weissbeer and mango tango mocktail. the beer was a wheat beer, which has similar taste of a draught beer you usually get but it was different in a good way.mocktail was pulpy and sweet. overall drinks were üëç

to go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette. the chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel. the cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high. overall food was good.

the service was quick and prompt(maybe due to less crowd when we went) and no issues there.

overall i would definitely recommend this place for a casual drinks night with friends or family.",4,Positive
"visited this place for a weekday lunch buffet.
ambiance is really good and even the variety of food offered is good for the price range. 
both veg and non veg starters were nice and in main course would specially mention the mutton biryani. apart from this there is live counter for pasta which is pretty good as well.
dessert section is decent but the molten lava cake with ice cream was amazing. it was served piping hot and really ended the meal on a delicious note.",4,Positive
it's another good spot which i frequent with friends. great selection of craft beers love the taste. the staff are always extremely friendly and give good suggestions. often go here to wind down the day with a pitcher of beer.,5,Positive
"landed in this small bar for new year lunch buffet. they had limited items in their spread but each of them were super yummy. nothing to complain about as this costed us merely 400bucks per head.
for drinks, i would totally recommend project 51 cocktail (a must try!)
the only downside was service. the waiters were friendly but extremely idle and we had a waiting period of atleast 10mins between the serves. many of the items were only served after repeated calls.",3,Neutral
"this is not a place to express hate but today i went their for a lunch it was a downer
we got the empty buffet counters and plates pasta counter is closed too early and all i felt shame in front of my guest poor guest management and service even you can see in photo my plate was empty even after the beer came on the table i never prefer for a party over their but sugeest you its a nice place to have beer and have some snacks as a bar siting on the bar counter, the beer over their was awesome give only mark for the beer.................",1,Very Negative

"worst quality, we found spider at glass of beer and we informed to them but there was no response from their side. it's very bad experience with this bar",1,Very Negative
"we found ""dead spider"" in beer mug which was disgusting. the folks from hotel claimed that it fell from roof or from a/c duct , which is not possible as we (four of us) could have not missed a spider landing into a beer .
even going by what hotel folks told that spider landed from roof or air conditioning duct its a matter of hygiene which is missing  . (on a lighter note the person who was drinking from the glass has not got any spider man capabilities) .",1,Very Negative
"catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance. as this place is mainly a bar, it is not sensible to comment on the food. the spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good. pricing is also decent.",3,Neutral
"great place overlooking bio diversity park junction to unwind after a hectic work day.

parking is valet's headache.

ambiance is quite contemporary & cozy.
music is loud & heavy.

great verities of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks with wonderful taste.

veg starters:
fried idli, nachos - outstanding
grilled veggies, garlic bread - very good
achari paneer - good can be little more softer & burnt at corners

main course:
mixed veg curry & butter nan are simply awesome

dessert:
chacolava with ice cream - okeish

pricing - little bit higher for the quantity, however quality is top notch.

service - when crowd is less very fast & vice versa!

must try place, check for great offers before ordering.",4,Positive
"they claim to be a european bar who serves continental cuisine.
went here with my pals.
we ordered peri
- peri chicken pizza and assorted pizza.

service: the waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well.
the service wasn‚Äôt the quickest with around 6-8 people in the house.
good parking available here.

food: the pizzas were pretty mediocre. i liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount. we asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff.
peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging.
the pizzas were missing the wow factor and wasn‚Äôt really specially.
my friends ordered pastas and wings.
wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and wasn‚Äôt too good.

ambience: it has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music üéµ. really liked the ambience and the decor as well. the tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look.

worth a shot with zomato gold

"@foodiee_globetrotter
perfect place for belgian beer!!
i visited this place for sunday drunch(as they say it.. breakfast+lunch+drinks).
it costs for rs1000 per person inclusive of taxes which includes welcome drink, soup, starters, main course, dessert and 2 tap beer of your choice.
i loved their hospitality.. for welcome drink they asked our choice and prepared it fresh.

in soup they had hot and sour which was yummy.

in starters they provided 6-7 differnt varieties which included crispy corn, paneer tikka, garlic bread etc.

coming to the main course they had limited menu with dal fry, dal makhani, mix veg, paneer korma, naan, chapati, curd, fryums and 3 kinds of salad.

they also cooked white sause paste just for us!!

in desserts, they had walnut cake, cutfruits, gulab jamun, shahi tukda, icecream and chocolava cake.

drinks we asked for was belgian kriek, erdinger dunkel and schzuimzuiper.

desserts were kind of okay.. so my suggestion is to make them better.. because it is the last part of the meal so everyone wants it perfect.",4,Positive
"tilt bar or european bar? 

i was surprised to hear of belgian beers being served in here. they are served nowhere else across india.

from bitter to spicy sweet, the options in imported beers are available in heaps. la trappe trappist is one of the most recommended beers in here endured through 600 years old history of monks brewing it.

for those who like it sweet, you should try belgian kriek. taste is perfectly balanced with rich sweetness giving it a fresh finish without the bitter aftertaste.

no beer belly!

beer hunters, this is the right place to rejoice if you are after some exotic beer.

must try bottle beers!
1. la trappe isod'or
2. la trappe triple
3. green killer
4. silly saison
5. barbar blond

i'll let you in a little secret - ask for the dessert of drinks (smeets waffle jenever shot) and don't you miss!

mocktail:

after glow - an amalgamation of fresh fruits mixed with mint and topped with litchi grape juices.

starters i'd recommend:

chicken wings, stuffed mushrooms and cheese broccoli

mains:

honey glazed lamb chops served with fries and rice. the rice flavour should be enhanced with an increase in quantity. 

desserts:

blueberry cheesecake. it stands out from the rest i have had at other places.

the staff is amicable and polite. swift service provided.

live music available as well. music system needs to be improved as the audio quality of vocalist sounds completely distorted.

"hats off to tilt republic bar- the only europeon bar in hyderabad for having such huge array of beers from different parts of the world.

the food, ambiance, service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers.

when i say food is good- in elaboration i mean from starters to main course to desserts everything is oh - so delicious!

the liquor section of tilt is hands down the most rare one, i say this cause of the beers they offer. i am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing i've had before.

the beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldn't get the taste elsewhere.

no no the story doesn't end here. one thing you wouldn't want to miss is...
the special shots over here -
jenever- waffle smeets ( my fav over here)
jenever- citroen
jenever- bessen

can't stress enough of how delicious these shots are(and very boozy)

a place that deserves multiple visits!",5,Positive

"man i unabashedly love tilt. it's a unique spot amongst all the bars in hyderabad. what sets it apart is both the beer and the service. order the egg manchuria without fail. the cooks are so good at making it now that you won't find a better version anywhere else in town.

the food tends to be on the spicier side, so if you don't want that do remember to tell you waiter during your order if you prefer it otherwise. this even applies to the pastas and pizzas.",5,Positive
"lovely european bar with probably the best drinks hyderabad has to offer (no exaggeration)

most of the drinks they have are imported from europe and are supposedly not found any where else across india.

they also serve trappist beers which are basically drinks brewed by monks for a charitable cause
and they also claim that all their booze is glycerine free without any preservatives and won't give you a beer belly

everything aside they officially serve the smoothest drinks in town and i can vouch for that!!!! they're pricey but worth it!!!

drinks-
beer: la trappe trippel (bottled)
witte
beer sampler- (the caramel and cherry ones were my favorite)
dubbel
belgian kreik
chamborlette
erdinger weisbier
erdinger dunkel
schuimpzuiper
miss spicy - they mean it when they say spicy
barbar blond (bottled)

jenever shots (pronounced yenever) (20% alcohol)
a type of dutch gin produced only in europe with juniper flavour

these were absolutely amazing
the smoothest shots i've ever had

smeets bessen jenever - fruity gin with a sweet base
citroen jenever- citrus flavoured shots with a tangy, zesty taste
wafel jenever- hands down the best shot i've had. ever.
tastes like waffle syrup. notes of caramel and pop corn. sweet, smooth and simply sublime

project 51- brandy cocktail with notes of cinnamon and spicy jalapenos

mango mint mocktail- super sweet mango flavoured drink with a mildly minty taste

food

food was pretty good. we tried
lasooni murgh
lamb chops - tender and well cooked
fries
cheese broccoli- creamy cheesy broccoli
florentine saute mushrooms
chickpea corn masala - good stuff to munch on while having drinks. had alot of peanuts.
cilantro grilled fish- tasted pretty indian
grilled fish with rice - recommended
saucy chest nuts
chilli garlic prawns - not very garlicky or spicy
veg assorted pizza- pretty good for a bar
choco lava cake

the food wasn't too oily or spicy. well flavoured and served warm.

over all rating- 4.5/5 ( only because there pricey)
food- 4/5
drinks- 4.9/5
ambience- 4/5
service- 4.5/5

would i go back here? hell yes",5,Positive

the chicken tikka was standard

a little spicy on your pocket, but what the heck a few beers don‚Äôt harm..

it was almost after an decade i landed in hyd and zomato came in rescue for my saturday night. i always feel the substance of the place is paramount and tilt bar won't dissapoint you. craftb served here is smooth as the breeze and i got so drenched till the closing. erdinger beer matched my dna and with amazing pizza and garlic bread spread with cheese ball must for vegetarian's. lamb served was good and so was chicken. i so lived that night at tilt's.,5,Positive

"i went to this place for a date and absolutely loved it. the layout , lighting, music is perfect for a romantic dinner. even if you are with friends and don't want to miss out an important match this is a very nice place for good food, good company and the indian team on a large screen :p. the staff is very very good (one of the best) .for the two of us they found a cosy corner where we would get some quietness yet not miss the match.when we were undecided about what to order, one of them politely suggested a fish dish and that turned out to be oh so tasty! cilantro fish is a must try here. i could have easily had another plate.the softness..the perfect marination..the taste of coriander...i loved it.then i ordered the non veg platter and i had wished i had just taken another suggestion :(. i didn't like prawn tempura at all.pepper chicken,soya chilli lamb and sesame fried fish were okayish.
for drinks again we turned to the waiter and he was again bang on with his choices.he got me a belgian kriek which is white beer based drink with the blend of cherry juice.i loved the tanginess followed by rich sweetness that lingers on in the mouth. my friend tried erginder dunkel - this is a wheat beer with delicate roasting aromas.i took a sip and liked it but i liked mine better.:p. then came the best part of our dinner - the choco lava cake! the ice cream served in a seperate bowl and the brownie filled with chocolate syrup which oozes out when you cut it.complete foodgasm! one of the best choco lavas i have had.i m gonna visit this place quite frequently :d",4,Positive

"i would rate ambience hardly at three and doesn't look like the pics on zomato. the place was smelly and even the ac wasn't working well. 
beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down. they don't have an in-house brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too. in comparison to it, there are a lot of places to try in-house brewed beers like otm brewery etc.
even their food menu is so limited and we tried their chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza i had in a long time, just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 bucks. similar experience with fish and chips, the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish.
really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as i went with high hopes. i don't recommend this to anyone because it's not even cheap to recommend to those who don't want to spend much.",3,Neutral

as usual it was soo rush and waiters and staff over there are in hurry to serve us fast and want to throw us out of the restaurant.üòê
yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
that is a negative of the management over there.
coming to the food
for veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. not a worthy starters for veg
for non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
main course...not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
salads were good
chat items not worthy
deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding
and lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.
they want us to give the rating infront of them
finally
ambience-3/5
food-2/5
service-4/5",2,Negative

"went for a lunch buffet yesterday and we were around 17 ppl.

the best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance.

ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail.

coming to starters, non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok. but they can introduce something new as its same everywhere.

we have chicken wings, chicken kabab, fish, prawns. they were just amazing.

we have tawa chicken and prawns but that was not up to the mark and that tawa items needs a huge change in taste.

main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like laal maas(mutton), prawns were awesome(love to visit again to eat this amazing prawns)

coming to desserts, they were just melting in mouth, my all time favourite jilebi with rabdi, asked for some hot jilebi at the end as well, i got a few.
kheer was ok, gulab jamun was good.

overall experience is good. it needs some minor changes in few dishes.

must visit place for non veg lovers.",4,Positive
subendu and narender- thanks for your pleasant service. i am delighted with the hospitality and food served. speacially the main course was aamzing. awsum varieties to enjoy,5,Positive

"this was totally an accidental visit,i had no idea about this place before we stepped into this one except for the fact that it's a bbq place,as the name suggests.it's two floored building beautifully lit,i was here for dinner.we opted for first floor,they immediately got the grill and the buffet starts.it's like any other bbq place but with high quality food.the starters are so very fresh,i definitely give it one of the best bbq places in the city.the menu was pretty much the same,the chicken wings deserves a special mention,we repeated it like 3 times 'awe'mazing.the main course was decent,the dessert section was again okay specially -pan shot-was like a panflavoured liquid in shot glasses and i loved it.everything was pretty much decent but what made me love this place more was the service.the service is amazing,shout out to ashraf and reetham.they made our experience more pleasant. the only complain about this place is the playlist,(more of old and sad bollywood songs) it was so loud and it totally is a huge off.i suggest please change the playlist guys,it's ruining the whole vibe of the place,this is the first time i had to bear music instead of enjoying it.anyways,i liked the unexpected visit to this place.",4,Positive
"we were 31 people went together for a lunch buffet on 22nd april. tables were arranged on 1st floor for us and no one else were allowed which is a plus for big group. coming to menu its kind of same what all bbq places are offering now a days. taste was good for most of the items. staffs were polite and quick on services. only thing which didnt went well was ac of the resturant. as it was a hot afternoon, ac was not enough to cool us downüòï. manger apologized for this. they also gave us a 10% off on total bill because of 20+ people.

advices to management = please have some unique food item which is not there on other places.
looking forward to visit again.",4,Positive
great food. awesome ambience. excellent service by raza and subhendu! wide range of options in starters and desserts. reasonable pricing. must visit!,5,Positive

"this restaurant has got a good location and interior. in the buffet menu, the starters and grilled items are good, but the main course need serious improvements. main course dishes are average and not up to mark. i think the price is also quite high in comparison to its dishes.",4,Positive

one of the best place to have brunch on weekends.
good food at great price.",5,Positive
"food was good , service was fast, staff courteous. subendu and raja took good care of us. overall great experience. don't forget to try jalebi rabri. ask the guy to make jalebi a bit crisp.",5,Positive
"after hearing good reviews about this, we went for lunch buffet. first and foremost thing you will notice is the courteousness of the staff there. once you book the table, they write your name on a board outside. we took the seat in the first level as the ground floor was full. starters were served. veg starters were too spicy,but very tasty. its better you mention them the spice level before itself. even main course was pretty good in terms of taste. nothing much special in the menu but taste and staff were good. ""bala"" who served us was very courteous. please give him a star.",4,Positive
"after months of trying out buffet restaurants in and around gachibowli, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that everything about the indi grill was worth the visit. one of the rare places where you'll find consistent quality across dishes - starters, main course, and dessert. jalebi does require a special mention.

combine this with courteous staff who ensure you have a good time right from the moment you step in and you have the perfect experience.

i would recommend visiting the place in the first slot, as things are reasonably quiet. not surprised at all that the second slot starts getting crowded!

if i had to be really critical, the veg menu has that tiny scope of improvement in an otherwise perfect place. keep it going!",5,Positive
i had a team dinner on friday night.the food was really awesome mouthwatering.we enjoyed lot with loud music here .we got the amazing service by team indigril. for sure we visit again to this place. folk must try the indigril.,5,Positive

"one of the latest buffet places in town. visited there last weekend for lunch. quite a big place with good decor. staff were helpful and service was quick. i loved the starters there. chicken leg kebab, other chicken starter were also very good. the best was prawns, tandoori prawns were just amazing. crispy corn, salsa potato and pineapple were also available. main course also had good variety from chicken, mutton to fish. desserts were also good. loved the galebi and rabdi the most",4,Positive

when it comes to spread of items, they were just too many. barbeque items, main course as well as desserts. the taste was however was not to the level of satisfaction. ambience was just average.

service definitely needs a heavy improvement. we went on a non rush day, serving of barbeque items were over flowing in the first and single service. there is no concept of coming to the table second time. no one really really bothered the table. even after requesting so many times, servers really didn't bother much to serve breads in the table or refilling any barbeque items. we just had to go with the main course to continue our lunch. mutton curry and biryani were extra ordinary. jalebi served in desserts was too good",3,Neutral
this restro is located in gachibowli in the platina building. we headed to this place for dinner with team on friday evening...the place is good ambience wise and the stuff are friendly too..the service was quick and they do ask you the reviews and suggestions..now coming to the food it was okay but as compared to other buffet kitchens like abs or barbeque nation they still lag behind with the same price..the starters were good in taste but the main course and dessert was ok ok..,3,Neutral

"this is located prominently along the main road and is a part of the same group which has the moti mahal chain of restaurants.

hopped in for lunch on a weekday after a movie at the nearby mall and it was a good experience to put it across in a lucid manner. the starters have mostly the usual fare you'd see in a typical barbeque restaurant. there was chicken, fish, prawn, mutton seekh kebab, chicken tangdi, chicken meat balls etc. in the non veg fare. the veg had the typical paneer, pineapple, corn on the cob, crispy potatoes in sauce which i would say were delectable along with the crispy corns. there is a complimentary mocktail which was decent but the masala coke i ordered later had too much masala and too little fizz for my liking.

the chats were toothsome and lip smackingly tasty. i also liked the kulchhas and parathas in the main course. they were soft and had the right texture and taste. just the way they should be. special mention of the veg and non veg manchow soup which was appetizing. my wife had multiple rounds of the same. the chicken, fish and mutton curries were good but i liked the dal makhni and matar methi malai among the lot. the gulab jamun and halwa along with the jalebi and rabdi were supremely delicious in the desserts section.

the service was quick and prompt. special mention of raghuveer singh who took care of our requirements and was always available when required. this is not a big place hence the ambiance is not much to talk about. they have seating on the first floor too which is an added bonus. all in all, this is definitely a place worth trying!",4,Positive
"located in the busy streets of kondapur this one gains quite an attention
indigrill is a chain of the grand moti mahal restaurants
set up in ground and first floors has a decent ambience
for present they are only running buffet section but they are going to start a-la-carte soon
.
.
we have been invited to try their buffet section
welcomed by the friendly staff we have been served first with their welcome drink
then moving on to the grill they had chicken fish and prawns on bbq in non veg
fish and prawns tasted great while chicken was a little hard
in vegetarian paneer mushroom and pineapple were served
apart from grill they had other starters too
mutton sheek kabab served here is one of the best i ever had
fresh minced mutton made into soft kebabs tasted amazing
and crabs were little but slow cooked and prepared in such a way that the flesh comes off easily tasted amazing
.
.
we were almost filled with starters but their main course spread is huge too
my favorites were
crab curry and mutter paneer
.
.
and in desserts
gulad jamun and jilebi with rabdi were lip smacking
strawberry pudding and phirni tasted good too",4,Positive
"this place is nice for formal dinners and family dinners. it's a comfortable place and the service was quick.
barbeque and starters was good here but the food here was average.",4,Positive
"this place is highly recommended. it is working with eat india company under the same roof, may be kitchen as well. basically u ca order any of the two‚Äôs menu from one table. eat india company has indian food while urban asia has asian food like chinese, thai food, etc.

we ordered the real bangkok basa, chef/subba‚Äôs secret recipe noodles and sanghai fried rice from urban asia.

the real bangkok basa- it tastes so good. it was steamed fish and mixed with some green sauce. taste was 5/5 .

subba‚Äôs secret recipe noodles was gravy noodles with lots of veggies, mushroom, chicken. taste 5/5

sanghai fried rice was a mixed of noodles and rice in which noodles was more than the rice. taste was 5/5

service 4/5, little bit slow in bringing food.

ambiance 4/5",5,Positive
we had evening dinner at this restaurant. food was delicious. we had chinese as well as north indian. both were delicious. i recommend for weekend food with family here,5,Positive
"the staff is kind and i think that's the moto of the restaurant. the food is delicious, and there is the option for buffet and alacarte, so we choose buffet which every thing they served on the table, which is really a good thing for me because i went with my parent. coming to the food special i like the most, corn cube, prawn, fish, and yes ofcourse murgh angara..the staff cares about all its customers and are polite, just amazing..
food 4.5
ambience 3.5
service 5
diffenitly will be back with my team cheers..",5,Positive
"came here on a thursday evening for dinner only to be served the worst quality food. the service was absolutely terrible... no air conditioning in the sweltering heat ... after multiple requests we got our food ( literally begged for the food to be served)... what‚Äôs not there on the buffet menu also they don‚Äôt tell the customer... the main course was served cold... pre-scooped ice creams.. and what not

some mango juice they served... don‚Äôt know how that was drinkable ....

worst decision to spend our evening here .. absolutely terrible experience

giving one star because i can‚Äôt give -5

food = -100/5
service - can‚Äôt put a negative number that high
ambience - no air conditioning on a summer evening
price ‚Äî not worth even 1/5th",1,Very Negative
i ordered a thai curry which is to die for . the waiters were so polite. the best thing in this place is that it's calm and quiet. it's a good place to relax and enjoy great food.,5,Positive
"the place is not worth going. too overrated and over priced. from starters to desserts, the food is not worth the money and not tasty. they don't charge properly for zomato gold, you have to check the bill carefully for the items deducted under gold 2+2. i would rate the place as:
food- 2/5
ambiance- 3/5
service-3.5/5
value for money- 2/5",1,Very Negative
"simply the best asian restaurant in the city. so fresh and lively food. this will enhance your health as well. i am vegetarian and i like the way they decorate and combine the veggies. must try corn cubes, vegetable pan fried noodles. 4 star for the service which needs improvement.",4,Positive
"this is my second visit to this place. like the ambience much and cool place to chill out. had been there along with a friend for dinner. we didn't want to go for buffet for sure, so it was ala carte.

angara murgu kabab, rara ghost and butter naan... starter was with much salt and lemon... rara ghost is nice, perfection at it's best... was a good combination with butter naan...

service was very nice and as i said earlier nice ambience...",3,Neutral
"visited urban asia based on their rating and reviews. however, we were utterly disappointed. we visited the gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with east india co. the waiter handed us the ""signature"" menu and that is when the ordeal began. most of the signature dishes were unavailable. it was surprising since it was a saturday and i assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their signature menu. eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. overall a disappointing evening.",3,Neutral
we have been there for team dinner for a buffet. ambience is good. food is decent but serving is not at all good. you can neglect this as we have lot of options aroubd gachibowli,3,Neutral
this is one of the favourite food spots in jubilee hills but this outlet they have started in gachibowli too been here with cousin..checked out menu for having different thing and ordered starter corn and cheese crudettes in smoked butter garlic..it was really yummy and the best starters i had in recent times and had aamir‚Äôs and gautam‚Äôs anda bandi fried the name itself was catchy..taste was also perfect..was spicy and yummy,4,Positive
"amongst the so many options now available for dining at gachibowli, urban asia is difficult to ignore both for location and food. getting in there if you are driving can be tricky sometimes since there is too much traffic in a narrow lane. however, they have a valet in the basement and you can park there and head over to the 4th floor which actually is a mix of a few restaurants. the place offers both buffet and a-la-carte options and you could choose what you like. we ordered pad thai noodle and chilly tofu. i have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot. moreover, the portion size was fairly decent. the pad thai tasted slightly sweet to my wife's liking but again flavoursome and good portion. the place was quiet and you could enjoy your food in peace. the staff is courteous and service is prompt.",4,Positive
"used to be a frequent visitor at this place. was total disappointed yesterday night . food was aweful to taste. chicken starter in bean sauce was bitter in taste. they we're serving what they deemed fit for us and not as per our order. chicken lababdar was wanting in taste, fennel seeds were used and curry was as thin as a soup , no one was nearby when serving were required. service is what we look forward to when dining in your restaurant.either there was change in chef or some other temporary issues. hope it would be fixed soon and we will not be disappointed when dining next time with our friends.",5,Positive
the place has the best asian food options. the nasi goreng here is authentic and taste like it not like other restaurants where they just give u fried rice. the pork fried rice is very tasty as well.,4,Positive
"i went to urban asia on a date and we had planned to have sushi. sushi was not available at all. we were heartbroken. ""sorry sir"" became the theme that night. date went dull.",2,Negative

the food was not made well and the service needs a lot of improvement. the pad thai was too sticky and the thai green curry was very watery. they didnot have ice to make drinks and we were kept waiting for a very long time for the bill. the outlet needs better management. unhappy with my visit here.,1,Very Negative
"we have been to urban asia - kitchen & bar, gachibowli. we ordered crisp noodles (shrimps) with sweet and sour sauce which was obviously a wrong choice. crispy noodles is never a right choice (at least for me) wherever you go and sweet n sour soup with shrimps just made it worse. i am a seafood lover and the quantity and size of shrimps didn't justify its price. next was standing pomfret dish in schezwan sauce...which turned out to be a disappointment. who prepares pomfret in all-purpose flour? it was not good at all.",1,Very Negative

"food - 4
service - 3

the food is nice but the fancy dishes fail to impress. had ordered lotus leaf fried rice - but that neither had any distinguishing flavor of lotus leaf nor a hint of chili oil, but what lets you down is the service - too slow.

and they also goofed up on the zomato 1+1 food offer. they later corrected it, but not before arguing.

will i go here again - yes, but not the gachibowli joint. the other urban asia at jubilee hills is a way better!",3,Neutral

starters were okay ,
i don't understand why there waso muglai / indian food and not asian food in an restraunt which specialises in asian cuisine.",3,Neutral
"dissatisfaction and disappointment!

urban asia gachibowli !
i am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what i was expecting. starters pathetic !
the prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. uncooked chicken malai kababs to kabab mei "" huddi"" (bone).
beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. the mocktail tasted really good. finally !!

coming to the main course i am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! trust me nothing special !!

the chat counter was good. u can try that. from chole kulche to bhel puri. 4 items.

deserts: limited but were good.

ice cream: they were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

overall
food 3/5
service 1/5
value for money 2.5/5

recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.
like 50% of an all.",3,Neutral
"on a saturday casual lunch, i was simply floored by the ambiance they have set up. and i couldn't stop looking at the artifacts they have put up. its like one could just spent hours looking at them and admiring the heritage of india.

i was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
the wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
the dragon prawns were okayish. the sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
sanghai fried rice: loved it
kung pao chicken : delicious
hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
shrimp soft noodles: good
bamboo fried rice: good
pan fried noodles in cantonese sauce: a disaster.

for my part i had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

the mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

i loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken. it has stuck on my taste buds.

this is my most favourite chinese asian cuisine joint here. i have been to this place a couple of times and their food is absolutely to die for. the buttet garlic rice and the green curry is lipsmackingly good. in appetisers i love the pork dumplings which are white balls of juiciness and the pork ribs that completely melt in your mouth. the staff is helpful and courteous. absolutely love everything about this place.,5,Positive
i have only been to this place once and i cannot forget the noodles i had! i never found that texture or taste in noodles anywhere else. i love it! the quantity is too much for a single person and good for 2. so do try it out!,4,Positive

ambience is not as good as the one in jubilee hills. but kudos to them for maintaining the same taste. courteous staff. gets a bit crowded towards the weekend so better to book a table prior. they have tie up with zomato for booking table which is good. tried the famous narsi goreng and it lived up to the expectation.,4,Positive

"extremely pleased to have visited this place and experiment with their masterpiece. i was disappointed as they didnt serve sushi on the day we visited, but rest of the food compensated for the grief. the pork ribs were amazing! the nasi goreng was something i was looking forward and it didn‚Äôt disappoint me. also the heaven on plate. the quantity they serve is too good, one main course can be shared by two with moderate appetite. the decor was amazing too but what was best about this place were the courteous and highly spontaneous staff. the fried icecream too was good , they served extra chocolate sauce on request. must try this gem of a place!",4,Positive
"this place is nothing as it is shown in the images. the ambience maybe good, but the service is too bad. the chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as i thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp. and if this was not enough the add on was the main course. the name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food, which creates a lot of confusion. we ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies, rather than semi gravy. the worst is the suggestions from the manager, who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered. knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy, it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them. moreover despite of showing the zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food, they added an extra service charge to the final bill. won't complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing.
my suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking, and importantly don't try and take suggestion from the management.
been to many asian restaurants, had bad food, but never got so confused about the menu. i had sandip acharyya with me. both of us are very dissapointed.
a big no no to this place.",1,Very Negative

1. garlic fried rice - good
2. mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. left half the dish. i am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. even if i liked other mushrooms, i wouldn't have liked this dish. it's nothing special. tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. showstopper - yin yan soup. half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. the other half of it had thick coriander soup. i think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. fan of this. coming back for this soup.",3,Neutral
"visited this branch of urban asia this afternoon for lunch. the eat india co (indian restaurant) is just beside urban asia and i read few reviews about this place (urban asia, gachibowli) not serving food as good as the jubilee hills branch as they share the same kitchen. but as i experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. they have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. even the buffet has nice spread of asian menu as well as some indian dishes. ordered our favourite pork ribs which is very very delicious. ordered some chilli lamb and orange chicken. chilli lamb was really delicious but the orange chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy.

"we opted for alakarte here. but the took a round of the food variety for buffet, it was pretty good. but the dessert section didn't interest me much.

the buffet had dumplings, sushi, which i felt were food for buffet.

we we in mood to eat proper chinese. we ordered a pork dimsum, stir fried chicken starter.
another chicken main course and fried rice.

everything was good.

but then comes the bill part.

i really don't know how they missed the zomato 1+1 to cut from the bill.
also they had so 91 bucks extra s. tax apart from gst.
which made us change the bill again.

honestly speaking, after serving good food, missing the gold and adding extra money apart from gst decreases the moral value for the place.

kindly try avoiding the addition of that.

rest food is good.
service if good.
can come back again for another turn of chinese.!!",3,Neutral
"the rating for the food taste is always 4/5 here but when comes to service i can't rate more than 1.5/5, the 0.5 is just for getting bill quickly and may be 1 for getting few dishes immediately. i visited this restaurant for the fifth time expecting to get better food and service than last time, but it is always degrading. we came in to lunch at around 2:45, the first thing which irritated was they were served me cold starters and i complained then they went and heated it up and served, this was corn cubes, they promised 11 started in the buffet menu and they never bothered to serve all. i had to ask him to check what the menu was and can he serve all of them and still they never served. i think they were supposed to serve soup at table along with starters which they always did before, i went and asked them about it then they said it is available at the buffet section and we can go and get it. i really felt like going to a place where they were serving free food and we had to go and ask for what we wanted. it was absolutely ridiculous experience, they started turning off the lights when we're still eating, i agree we were late but switch off all the lights and we go out in a kind of darkness? it is no more pathetic situation, like they are not bothered about the customers, and we can get in if we want. i was always thinking urban asia is a premium place for good food and service, but it proved other wise.",1,Very Negative
"went here for a family dinner on a weeknight. ambience is nice, we were seated by a nice table by the glass wall. service was very good as we got started with a manager standing close by and ensuring service was happening briskly. two of us went with the buffet and others went ala carte. the buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot. veg appetizers were good, chicken was very average and the fish was quite good. budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while. we didn't have much appetite after the starters so that was good. lots of little desserts - pastries looked better than they tasted, but kids enjoyed the ice cream cold stone. overall experience was quite good for all of us - attentive service always goes a long way and we will be back.",4,Positive

"a beautiful asian restaurant with awesome food.

food : 4.5/5 tried some items from their special menu and some from their normal menu. the soup was awesome and the way it was presented with two clear demarcation between the two flavors made it even more special. the dumplings were really good, it was juicy at the center with a very thin crust. the dumpling dip could have been better though. the nyonya was again very delicious and the lemon grass flavor in the curry was just out of this world. the nasi goreng was very smelly of dried fish and something that we did not enjoy. have tried their buffet also earlier and liked the unconventional nature of the buffet which servers indian and asian together. the green curry in the buffet was again very delicious.

ambiance : 3.5/5 this is actually two restaurant under the same roof. i am not sure why was that done and other than the buffet it really does not make any sense sense.

service : 4/5 service was again very good. they took the time to explain the dishes notified of the possible wait time for any dish and above all were very friendly.

price : 3.5/5 it is priced at per some of the fine dining restaurant and as such is fair. the only thing is that in such fine dining set up you should not run a buffet and a la carte in parallel.",4,Positive

i informed the management about this and they did not even get back to check on how the kid (who fell sick) was doing.

extremely poor food quality and hospitality. was thoroughly embarrassed in front of the guests and regret having chosen this restaurant for my event.",1,Very Negative
"it is two restaurants under the same roof, really don't know why so, because they present you the menu of both at either place. not sure if they share the kitchen and chef too. 
we ordered from urban asia's menu, and the food was good. the service, on the other hand, is a little disappointing probably because of the confusion between the restaurants. 
ordered some lamb starters and thai curry red. the thai curry was great and the remained for hours in my mouth.",4,Positive
"this restaurant space in gachibowi is the fusion of urban asia and eat india company which are under the same roof with different names.

‚úìambience

this is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience. this restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all-around the place. most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors, windows and locks.

and also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami kings and their belongings.

‚úìfood

we went here for a dinner buffet. the food is really delicious and this was the first time i was liking sea food in the starters. all the starters are really good but kung pao fish and prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind.

dinner buffer menu:

*starters:

1. murgh haryali tikka
2. lahsooni murgh tikka
3. kung pao fish
4. prawns parsely dry
5. crispy potato corn cube
6. sichuan baby corn
7. paneer angar tikka
8. corn tikka
9. french fries

*main course:

1. bindi jai puri
2. yellow dal tadka
3. palak paneer
4. murgh lababdar
5. mutton do pyaza
6. murgh dum biryani
7. sabzi dum biryani
8. garlic noodles
9. butter naan and roti
10. curd rice
11. khow suey

*salads:

1. tossed salad
2. crispy noodles salad
3. kimchi salad
4. grilled chicken salad

*desserts:

1. pineapple tarts
2. chocolate brownie
3. pastries
4. shahi tukda
5. varied flavors of ice creams.

we don't have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings. just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth.

‚úìservice

the only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide. though it is a buffet, all the starters will served to the table. there is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve.

and you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve. the service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance.

‚úìvalue for money

the dinner buffet here costs around rs.650/- per person. and you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money. be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy. have a great dining and good dayüòä",3,Neutral

ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce. like the dish, could have been less spicy though.
next up was chicken dumpling. this was yummy.
chicken thai red curry was good and creamy, but again was a bit spicy for thai curry. think the restaurant needs to tone down the spicy quotient of asian food, otherwise the food was fresh and tasty.",4,Positive

honestly i dont dig indo-chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal indian dishes. quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. the desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually. the service and starters were enough for me to keep it going. was not really in the mood for the mains. one can give it a try, especially those chinese food lovers.",4,Positive

"our first experience with urban asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. the first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which i don't remember unfortunately).

the establishment houses two different restaurants (eat street and urban asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. you can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. the service usually is prompt and courteous . overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

since we love asian cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent i would like to specially mention the nasi goreng. we have tried it in many restaurants in india besides having it in bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

we would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies.",4,Positive
"their portion sizes are good for 2-3 people for most of their dishes unlike what your server would suggest. probably he has seen a different sample size :) but this is a nice chinese place serving both buffet and a la carte. do try their ginger fried rice and chilli garlic noodles. again, i stand guilty for viewing and commenting on the menu from a vegetarian standpoint but do try their spring rolls too :)",4,Positive
"completely disappointed. the staff was clearly reluctant to work.
the food was mediocre at best. we ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. nothing was made fresh.
we had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. so we walked out without completing the lunch.
thoroughly disappointing.
ambience is the only saving grace for this place.

"a must visit place for their exquisite asian cuisine ,not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes !

the ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth. one does start feeling the aura of fine dine - for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example.

we ordered vegetable chilli sticks ,salt and pepper chicken as starters .
vegetable chilli sticks (1st pic) is a must for all vegetarians here ,if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best chinese dish i ever ordered (5/5)

salt and pepper chicken was good - as told by my accompanying friend . i found the texture good ! he rates it (4/5)

for main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish .

chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies .very balanced ! a must to mention is the quantity served , it can be shared by 3 people (4.5/5)

button mushroom ,diced babycorn in oysters sause- this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy . it blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles .(4/5)

i also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that (2/5)

final verdict - authentic asian food with great ambeicne .with zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently !",4,Positive
"i went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. this outlet is in gachibowli rd above ratnadeep store. there are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
it was little surprising as this restro share the common space with eat india company.
we did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
one of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. the staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

we were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.reluctantly they agreed but i was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
they could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. crabmeat soup- this soup was thick with minced crab meat. the broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. the whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. corn cubes - a must try out platter. the dish was innovative. the american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. it was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. chicken yakitori- i did not like this preparation. it was very dull and tasteless. there were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. the chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

main course -

1. manchow chicken fried rice - the rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. it was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

dessert
1. bangkok custurd- i was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. the custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. the thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! it tasted like firni. as accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. it was just yum for the greedy tongue.

total- rs. 1396 ( inclusive of taxes )

cobclusion - the price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.the food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

the staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. no coordination among the staffs. either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

the dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. i had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

this is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. i will think twice to visit this place again.",3,Neutral
"we went to urban asia for lunch around 1 30 on a sunday for ala carte and i certainly would not recommend it for anyone. though the food was good, the service was pathetic. we were ignored for more than half an hour despite calling for the waiters multiple times. we were not even given the speciality menus despite specifically asking for it.

"#urbanasia #panasian #delightfulexperience.

well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now. the food here is an absolute delight. when they say pan asian , they mean pan asian . the experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that i was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch. and i would love to visit this place over and again, if not for anything but the orange chicken.

food( 4/5)

the food here is an absolute delight. no chance is left for any complaint. good to mention, both the time i have tried ala carte and not the buffet.

starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil chiken to the sanghai prawns, all of them were absolutely delicious. the spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs, it has a chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer.
the aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes. fresh, refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter.

the sanghai praws are good, well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud.

amongst all their dishes , my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the orange chicken , which is a must must try here. this dish is an absolute delight to the minf, soul and taste bud. this i believe is the most innovative pan asian dish which i haven't had in a long time. i call this an innovative dish because no other pan asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything.

service (4/5)

i believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it's staff.. here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other. kudos to the staff.

ambiance ( 4/5)

as urban asia is a chain of restaurant, we were made to sit at their indian counterpart as it was a saturday night and quite late . the interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural india in it's decor which i guess is a perfect combination for the indian restaurant.

"this place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that's about it.

went on a sunday and there was no crowd at all. the ac was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. the service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.

i honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. the stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.

it's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. these guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. could give it a try for the ambiance though.",3,Neutral
"have been to lunch with friends here today, first things, ambiance seems to be pretty good, i think people just carried on ambiance for this location. serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. we need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, welcome drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. desserts were not so great and not many. felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark. all in all pathetic service, you will literally ask 'n' number of times for food which is served on table. not a wide range of dishes. taste not so great especially with mock tails. totally disappointed",2,Negative
"beautiful ambience. the vintage look took me back to some good old days. the food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. for instance, 30 min for a glass of coke? we had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban asia and eat india company are together. the staff didn't attend us for a long time. i gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience i had with the people i went with.",3,Neutral

drop in to this place with my partner for lunch,.they have zomato gold 1+1 food offer.. ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attention....liked the quotes on pillars..
in starter, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces.. actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste i could feel..
in main course, we ordered patiala shahid paneer
which was one of their signature dish which i was expecting to be good in taste..but again i disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..ajwain paratha and naan was good in taste

my experience was not so good..plus, staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish..",2,Negative

eat india company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. interestingly, in eat india company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient india decorum.

when we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. they were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.

finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. the order arrived after 15 minutes. plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. the stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.

in main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. curry was too ordinary with lot of curry leaves in it.

after having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. think before you visit this place. and in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill.",2,Negative

went for dinner with friends. was bit disappointed with the service and food. firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed urban asia nd eat india on the same floor. which make service bit slow and confused.
we opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. for example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and khaw-souy for veg.
it's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great.",3,Neutral

ok. so there was buffet at the eic. i scanned thru it and they had very good options. there were number of options. very intriguing. though i had √† la cart. 

ambience is very good. you want to go and see whats on every wall, it's interesting. lighting is good, you get to see what you are eating (i've seen some dont have enough lighting. not talking about dialogue in the dark here, hehe).

though the prices are in a bit higher end, but thats something you can expect from a brand like urban asia.

now talking about the food, the varieties offered in both veg and nonveg is quite good and delicious. they take there their time to get the food, but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed.

overall a good place for family as well as to hangout with friends.",5,Positive

"i have been to eat india company twice. to sum up my experience, i found the service sloppy and mindless. food has fluctuating standards here, for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines. 
the kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland.
the service was so lethargic that i had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3-4 tables were booked.
the only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great, authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer.

late review. ambiance is good(theme : ancient india with various stuffs). i forget the name of the dishes and mocktails (most probably 1 chicken and 1 mutton dishes (main course)). main course was good. i preferred chicken dish.,4,Positive
"being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat!
but the restaurant has disappointed.
1. ambience and service was great.
2. we went for buffet , firstly the starters weren't that good at taste. common panner kebab type of starter, corn , chicken, veg kebab. well none o them weren't good as having them twice.
3. main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. no panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. skipped and went to the desert section.
4. desserts was like stabbing a dead man. nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.

overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. if you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one.",3,Neutral
this place served the worst indian food i could ever ask for in hyderabad. the towels were dirty and not properly washed. the food was just horrible. loud music from the pub above will spoil your dining experience even more and when i asked for outdoor seating they lied saying it's only a smokin' area. not visiting this place ever again. an extra star only coz of the interior otherwise this place is just worthy of a 1 star.,2,Negative
"eat india company is attached to urban asia.
we tried out their buffet.
food was decent. liked the starters, and the main course menu. thai green curry was impressive.
service was a little slow.
i would have liked more variation in deserts.
nonetheless, a decent meal.",3,Neutral

"pathetic!!! a group of 20 people from work visited this place, we didn't have great expectations, at the same time we didn't foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be. half of us were seated close to the glass facing the gachibowli road, thanks to their incredible maintenance, the ac was so poor, we were all sweating profusely. we weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. the choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. the food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. we will never be going back to this place.",1,Very Negative

nothing for vegetarians

"a group of 4, we decided to visit this place on saturday evening. the location is quite on the main road, however, the parking and the entry is terrible. they can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn-off.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

after entering the restaurant, we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor. it had a very india taste to it. they had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. üòç

coming to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. hariyali paneer tikka and corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. corn cubes cannot be missed here. my friend ordered a chicken starter which was quite average though. moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. paneer lababdar, mushroom curry and nizami handi seemed like good choices. food was decent.

the service was not impeccable. it ca surely be improved. also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. quite a surprise. üòë

the price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. üòÖüòÖ it can be a great negative. they accepted gold on food, so yay!

overall, a good experience, but probably not one worth visiting again.",3,Neutral

we enjoyed a lot :)",5,Positive
"i went in for a late night dinner after work. i was happy with the service provided. best part about this place is their interior. the antique royal doors, old locks and vintage pictures hanging on the wall and ceiling added to the charm. quality and quantity is almost worth the price. the ambiance is perfect for a peaceful sumptuous meal. i would definitely suggest this place.",4,Positive
"if you‚Äôre wondering what to do on sunday then head to eat india company, gachibowli. eat india company has been one of my favorite restaurants in hyderabad since years. now they‚Äôve opened a new branch in gachibowli. yay to all my office folks. everything from the ambience to the d√©cor, to the music is wonderful. the quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent. i love love love indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you‚Äôre a meat lover. everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum!

on sundays, the branch at gachibowli teams up with urban asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm. urban asia is another brilliant kitchen for asian food. if you love chinese and indian food, you cannot miss this brunch. they have more than 27 dishes with veg and non-veg options plus desserts. apart from this, they also had chaat and sushi as well when i went. all this at 888 per person only. what a steal deal. my favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab, chicken angara, kang pao fish, mutton rogan josh and of course the dal bukhara [for those of you who don‚Äôt know, this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor].

make sure to book your table in advance. another good tip in case you‚Äôre someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it‚Äôs usually not crowded at that time. let me know how you like it! thank me later.",5,Positive

"it was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn‚Äôt expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure.

so it‚Äôs a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light. has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for software professionals and casual lunches with friends.

i have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that i had a nice time.

so in the spread, something that i loved dearly was the chilly prawns. i just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. it was amazing.
the chicken was alright. but i can say but prawns were the best. although they were really small, but can‚Äôt complain much. they didn‚Äôt give us fish even after we asked for it.

staff: attentive and service was okay.

ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.

food: food was definitely good i liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. they were pretty bad.

complaints: starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. he broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. didn‚Äôt wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. for all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.

second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. lost our appetite soon after that.

third is with one of the waiters, probably didn‚Äôt want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. he agreed to get some but never showed up with it. i hope it‚Äôs his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.

hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.

if those factors are avoided, then will go again definitely.",3,Neutral

"when we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.

my sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds labonel fine baking in high regard. keeping this in minds we thought a labonel cake will make her birthday more special.

we ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. we also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).

they decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. so, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.

well since the cake held sentimental value for me i did leave immediately and rushed to the gachibowli store. i made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when i saw that the store was closed! to add to it no one answered the phone.
i stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.

i could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. if they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments i do not think it would ever matter how their product is.

my sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.

since they did not contact me back even the next day i feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. i hope this falls on deaf ears of labonel owners.

i know i will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)

cupcakes that edge sweet without being overpowering so i can share with the ""i don't like desserts that are actually sweet"" crowd. don't be surprised if you gulp down the entire box in a sitting.

a fine carrot cake cupcake that almost makes you feel like you're eating ""healthy"" until you eat the luscious cream cheese frosting. that's one of my top favorites.

life is short - eat sweets. buy them here. be happy!",5,Positive
"i absolutely love ordering from this place for all special occasions. i make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever i am visiting my parents.
this place is pretty expensive and there‚Äôs no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year, it‚Äôs so worth it.
i have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but i have tried their sample cakes multiple times and i can‚Äôt wait to order them.

must-go place in hyderabad. you can't miss it!",5,Positive
"although, i have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, i can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. hochn√§sig is a word that came to my mind when i visited this place the first few times. hoch is high and n√§sig comes from nose. this german word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as ‚Äúhochn√§sig‚Äù does. however, that is not all they are. they are in fact one of the best bakeries in hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. i said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:

1.    this place is expensive.
2.    except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.
3.    they don‚Äôt sell cake-slices. you must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.

now coming to the gooooooood stuff‚Ä¶

brownies:
the best i have ever had! the chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. i know some of you may say that that‚Äôs not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. but, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.

chocolate cakes:
i have tried one of their classic chocolate cake and triple chocolate cake. all the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. the best one is clearly the triple chocolate cake.

carrot cake:
to me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. one is the desi kind that you get at parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. the other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. labonel being a ‚Äúfine baking‚Äù place naturally has the latter kind. although i am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, labonel‚Äôs carrot cake is the best i have ever had in this category.

cheesecakes:
i have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry i think. it was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. the base was delicious too. however, the cheesecakes at eclat or chili‚Äôs are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.

cupcakes:
cupcakes are their only product that i am not a fan of. they are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. you can give the cupcakes a complete miss.

cookies:
choco-chip, double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm‚Ä¶

miscellaneous:
there are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. the honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.

overall, if you don‚Äôt mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don‚Äôt give this place a miss.",4.5,Positive
"#brownielove  # bakedwithlove

classic calm interior. i loved their theme color ""blue"". packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. 

brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. they were simply the best. 
one has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. 
place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie.

i don't want to go and eat chocolava in dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have brownie here. 
why not offer a single piece or small one person box (3-4 pieces may be).",4,Positive
"brownies, cupcakes and their blueberry cheesecake! i would give all of it a 10/10. the blueberry cheesecake is just too cheesy, that it certainly melts in your mouth.",5,Positive
ordered a vanilla fudge cake for my wife's bday.. the cake was okayish at best.. the frost was very sweet like the ones you get in cheap ones.. the layers were soft but not something which would just melt in your mouth.. all in all the cake was not worth its price and hype.. disappointed,2.5,Negative
"awesome cakes and cookies. worth every penny. good ambiance although outlet is not that big.good service, delivery on time. till now i have tried cakes only, will visit soon to try cup cakes and other cookies. i am searching for red velvet cake, i hope they met my expectations.keep up the good work. :)",4.5,Positive
amazing ..never had so delicious brownie. its so so soft that it just melts in ur mouth n is chocolaty. the cup cakes are also amazing. u cannot ahve a single piece here. u have to take a full box of 15 pcs whatever u take. one must must have it.,4.5,Positive
"this place is fine baking indeed. classy outlet as well, with very foreign inspired interiors.
their chocolate chip cookie is very good (chewy and tasty).
the honey chocolate cake is a good bet for your evening snack.
the cupcakes here are my all time favorite (choclate feels better than the red velvet)
their brownie is also one of the best in hyderabad and is quite a good option for gifting people as well as being a recepient of such a box of delight.",4.5,Positive
"i have ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. their online menu says it's their signature cake. it was the worst cake i ate till date. it's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. and of course cream cheese frosting. there were simply too many kismiss in there. i hated every bit of that cake.
i have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. how much ever i say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake.",3.5,Neutral
"had their classic brownie cake which is served on a box. the brownies are fine, but too expensive for their taste i would say. there are other outlets with lower prices but tastier brownies.",3.5,Neutral
"i am in love with cup cakes and labonel made it much more romantic üòÑ
the cream and the bread are just perfect and the flavours are amazing. though i felt it a bit over priced, it didn't come to my mind as long as i was indulged in eating them. it would be great experience worth the price, you must try them.
next target: their brownies üòÉ
the only thing i would like to be changed about this place is that, they should have menu options for the customers to eat there itself. it is such a beautifully designed place and just takeaway makes the experience unfinished.",5,Positive
"one of best brownies that i've tasted.
little expensive though. look forward to visit again when next time in hyderabad.
very polite gentleman whom i met :)",4.5,Positive
"there's no better place to satisfy your dessert cravings than this heavenly place, the labonel. i love their cake measuring schemes, unlike kilos :-) one must have to forget about calories strictly when you visit this place.

my favs are brownies, red velvet, dark chocolate, white chocolte and all cup cake versions! they're so soft, melts in mouth, just so yummm in tummy:-)

yes! they are very expensive. almost costs a bomb !! 5500 rs for a birthday cake but its all worth it once a while for any of your grand special occasion.. go treat your tastebuds at labonel üëç",4,Positive
very poor store management. ordered for an eggless cake on friday 05th may 2017 and they confirmed my order. before the pickup i just called them to check if the cake is ready and they simply say there is no order on my name at all. this is pure irresponsibility on the part of labonel gachibowli. thank you for spoiling my day.,1,Very Negative
"the best tasting and expensive baking place

the brownies are top rated and even the chocolate cakes too but with a expensive tag

if you like to order a chocolate cake classic chocolate cake is the best

if you are not worried for the price tag this is a must try place",4,Positive

"i absolutely love the red velvet cupcakes from labonel. they are the best! although i am from bombay, i would rate these cupcakes to be the best in the world(and trust me i try red velvet cupcakes & cookies everywhere i travel!). they beat theobroma in bombay hollow. 

even their brownies, cakes are the softest most sumptuous ones ever! must buy several boxes every time, you visit hyderabad!",5,Positive
"they make the best red velvet cake and cup cakes in hyderabad !!
their chocolate cake is very rich and gooey buy my first preference has always been red velvet !!
their brownies are my husbands fav..
their packaging and all are high end so best for gifting !!
but they don't customise the cake according to your taste.. you've got to take what they have !!
only downside is , its a over priced , so occasional indulgence is what i go with in order to satisfy my sweeth tooth ..",3.5,Neutral
the best brownie i had till date. it's not like those regular brownies. it has a different taste and softness. i also tried their cupcakes. but nothing can beat their brownies. very fancy packaging. perfect to gift someone,4,Positive
"absolute bliss to have a brownie or cake from here!!
have made it a point to order cakes for all my special events from this place.. thumbs up for the quality and taste!!",5,Positive
"absolutely the best bakery in the area, hands down.

the cakes from this place are kept hidden in pgs and quads, because they are totally worth the fight as well as arguments. right now, when i am writing the review i am salivating remembering the taste of the brownies.",4.5,Positive
best place in town for brownies. they were so good that i ended up eating an entire box by myself. i heard very good feedback on their cakes as well.,5,Positive

red velvet and chocolate are our favourites",5,Positive

cupcakes and cookies are a must try..
min order is 10pcs
thats the only setback for people craving for a sweet tooth.. overall superbb!!",4.5,Positive
"one of the premium bakers in gachibowli, most of the items are made to order, probably 24hrs prior booking is required, found only few cupcakes, brownies ready, and that too it's for takeaway, can't dine in... bought the chocolate and red velvet brownies, cost for 1kg around 800 or so... good packing. taste is good. but there are places which serves better brownies.
cost is at the higher end.",3.5,Neutral
"delicious chocolate brownies... the packaging is awesome too!!
been wanting to visit ever since i heard about the banjara hills branch, but somehow never got the chance to.
the price is a bit steep though, but an occasional indulgence which the product is meant for anyway, is perfectly fine. 
i'm not too good with dessert consistency and stuff, but all i can say is this is a place i would definitely recommend for dessert treats and parties.
the brownies are moderately sweet and rich and not too moist.

i will be back for the cupcakes.",4.5,Positive
"i have been lusting after this place, after reading too many 5 star reviews on zomato.  so yesterday the occasion was right  and i was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my so. unfortunately, i was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. the staff at labonel don't know anything about customer service.they were very rude and mean to us. i wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if i was there to steal their products. very impatient and unwilling to help. and also their phone number never works. tried calling several times and never got a response. anyways coming to food. i only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes the price burnt a hole in my  pocket. only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. the flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. i tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and i  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. yes it was like eating a sponge(i am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). nothing but just hype . i have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.  

final note: never ever  going to visit the place again. overrated place",2,Negative
labonel has become a hotspot for premium and rich baking. the taste is amazing and makes you indulge in more. tasted red velvet cake on my friends birthday and it makes you go ummmmmm,3.5,Neutral
"definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. amazing cakes and brownies. it is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.
my personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. i didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes.",3.5,Neutral
"it is a delight for dessert lovers, slightly expensive but awesome stuff, ordered a cake for my wife from here recently and that cake is probably one of the best ones i have ever had. a must visit place!",4.5,Positive
we have brought cakes from labonel jubilee hills many times and it has always been great. on christmas we tried labonel gachibowli plum cake. the cake was very good and the dried fruits were of very good quality. totally enjoyed the cake.,4.5,Positive
"absolutely delighted with our overall experience. the shop had an excellent festive decoration. ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. the moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. they mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. the price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. we were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. the brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. this was one of the best brownies i have had in a long time. we also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. want to try everything in the menu in future. keep up the great work!! will definitely recommend.",5,Positive
"i have been to banjara hills outlet...it was so difficult to find it‚Äôs exact location...no sign or board or anything...i literally had to ask someone around...i had no idea it has been closed and i haven't been to gachibowli outlet but anyway i wanted to write something about labonel...i don't know where it is situated at gachibowli & i don't know about the ambience & i haven't tried there cakes yet which i had heard from many ppl that they are beautiful & tasty...anyway but i did try there cupcakes & brownies when they were still open at there old location...i must say i wasn't impressed...there are lots of praises about the cupcakes in the reviews over here but it wasn‚Äôt worth the expectation...mind u guys, i have a sweet tooth so naturally i will be having high expectations...they are bit too pricy and with that price they are giving tiny cupcakes...they were tasty, not like wow, but come on if ur keeping the price tag so high atleast increase the number of cupcakes in the box...same is the case with brownies...if they really want to attract large number of customers, they should reduce the price...i don't know how they are still surviving...",2.5,Negative
"there isnt much i can say about labonel that hasnt been said already.
the bakery is just fantastic and has some of the best brownies and cupcakes you could hope for.
red velvet brownies are really great and something different, that not every place offers.
the packaging makes for a great gift, so give it a go. even birthday cakes can be ordered here, a little costlier than usual options but superb in terms of taste no doubt . (atleast a day before preorder)",4.5,Positive
"most importantly, the cake tasted like heaven. i had ordered for the classic chocolate cake as suggested by the person attending me and it was true love, especially for the people who are chocolate fanatics like me.
the ambiance is very sophisticated and the decorations are really good.
the only thing i did not like is that you just cannot wake up one day realizing you want at little bite of the amazing cake you had, as the minimum requirement for ordering a cake is 1 kg and they don't keep pastries !!",4.5,Positive
its a made to order cake shop. we got some cupcakes and cookies from here. cookies were nice (it had to be it costed something 650 for a box of 15). cupcakes were just average.,3,Neutral
"the cupcakes were really good. soft and creamy. their cookies also felt very different and almost melted in the mouth. the only drawback is the quantity which you need to buy for an order as it's purely a takeaway restaurant. one last thing, labonel is not light on your pocket.",4,Positive
"i dont know much about gachibowli branch, but banjara hills branch has the worst costumer service that i have ever seen in my life..! very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. they have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. my whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. i have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. i was okay with it and said i will collect it from their store. i almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, i reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. i kept giving them information about how far i am and that i would reach them in less time. i requested them to wait for 5 minutes as i was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. they answered my call at 9:00 when i was near gvkone. i said i will come in 5 min they said they will wait. but, by the time i reach their place everything was locked. i called them 100 times and their was no response. what an awful service..! if you have a big party, please don't rely and order anything from this place. worst experience..!",1,Very Negative
"superlative! i have been here once, and the taste hasn't left me since! i love their brownies. they are super yummy, and the texture is something i have never been able to find anywhere else yet. it is a melt in the mouth treat, just the right amount of everything in it. i also loved their assortment of cupcakes. worth a try!",5,Positive
"updated review:
ever since my first visit to labonel i have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too. this cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. all the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. they are definitely at the top of their game right now.
p.s. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.

previous review:
a class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. all this while i avoided this sweet gem coz i assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.
because i was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, i quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....i can go on and on raving about this piece of art. i do like to clear the air about misconception of labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. a box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;p
with suvi kanchan",4.5,Positive
"these brownies literally melt in your mouth!
red velvet and vanilla cupcakes are scrumptiousüòç
but i really wish we could sit down and eat 1/2 pieces in the bakery. makes you think twice about going to labonel because you have to get an entire box each time . it's nice to see that a great amount of effort is put into the packaging and presentation of labonel's products.",3.5,Neutral
the classic chocolate brownies of labonel are like heaven! they are extremely soft and melt in your mouth. the cookies are yummy too. the interiors are very well done up and pleasing to the eye with the classic vintage decor. the only sad part is that they don't sell the brownies per piece and you need to buy an entire box.,4.5,Positive
one day my husband got this yummy brownies in a exotic looking packet and i really had to google to know details about this store.thats what labonel is.must say they make awesome pastries,5,Positive

the cup cakes are so tasty and pan cakes for birthdays are so delicious
choco brownies and chocolate cakes are so worth for its higher price",4.5,Positive

hands down the best cup cakes and brownies in hyderabad. they don't compromise on quality and you can feel that in the rich flavors and amazing taste. we had even ordered a cake from their for one of our directors birthday and good did that cake fly after it was cut. pricing is a bit on the higher side but totally worth it.,4.5,Positive
this place stays in the best 5 bakeries in the city for chocolate cake for sure.had ordered and picked up a 3 layer chocolate cake irrespective of pricing its tasting made everyone stun shock its truly a classic chocolate cake. the only con is pricing but worth the money for the taste. don't miss the chocolate cake.,4,Positive
"i went to labonel a long time ago.

there has always been a lot of hype about labonel, especially for their cupcakes. i personally disliked the red velvet cupcakes because of the buttercream frosting. second, the cupcakes were available only in boxes and not individually which wasn't cost effective or practical at all.

however, i tried their brownies at a later point through a friend's purchase. they are quite delicious. i would definitely have more. but wouldn't go through the effort of buying a whole box.",3.5,Neutral
seems like your in a classic movie from the 60s when you walk in. what a decor...deserts are splendid. worth the money you pay. ordered the classic chocolate cake. yummmmm..,4.5,Positive
"we went to have coffee at this place. they have such awesome ambience. coffee was fantastic and mushroom, corn and jalape√±o pizza was out of this world. plus you can actually book sports bikes and cars from this place. and if you have the moolah can take lamborghini for a ride. i‚Äôm going for 4/5 for this hell of a place.",4,Positive
"driven is a bike themed cafe where you can even take bikes or luxury cars for rent

the interior and lightening is really soothing.
i preferred sitting on the first floor as it gave a better view of the place.
for food, we ordered a chilli garlic toast, chocolate donut with mocha frappe and vanilla frappe.

individual rating:
food: (4/5) the donut was not upto the mark
service : (5/5) it's self service, but my order was ready in like 5 minutes
pocket friendly : (4/5) the portion size was really small for the money they were charging

such a unique concept this cafe has of hiring bikes and cars and enjoying coffee along with it. ambience is too cool and food is also nice. really loved my visit there.,5,Positive
i went this place with a lot of expectations.i travelled 30 kms with full of curiosity and then when i reached the cafe i ordered my food and went exploring the cafe it was good with all bikes and cars surrounded by it. the theme of the cafe was too good but i waited for 30 min bcoz the top floor of cafe was under maintenance to see ambience of cafe i waited there and when i went upto there i find some intresting stuff i am satisfied with you btw the food was some what good...!!,4,Positive

"i love this place. perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. spacious, evergreen english songs eg nirvana, bryan adams, on the back ground. it is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. this cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

but the negative point is that they don‚Äôt have much items on the food menu which is why i gave only 3star.

recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items.",3,Neutral
"reviewing after a long time because this was really special.me and my husband went on a long drive and when i suddenly had the craving to have a nice cup of coffee this place happened. the ambiance was really cozy and different.we ordered cup of tea , coffee and pizza. the best part was the heart shaped almond choco pastry.loved the theme and concept of cars and bikes.",4,Positive
"a cozy,classy cafe to visit amidst the chaos at this junction.loved the ambience...truly justifies their theme of automobiles.one would wish to own the cars they have for display,someday!!!
they had a widespread authentic menu.and since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.and all of the items left us craving for more.
you would find plethora of coffee. it is paradise for a black coffee person.the way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.you are the best,driven cafe.you have my heart.

this place is well setup in gachibowli near sheraton hotel. surrounded with some fancy cars and bikes with some great ambience and blood rushing coffee. visited this place many times and tried few items on their menu.

"the first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambience. you have a triumph thunderbird lt on one side with it's massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red. there's great music playing and there's riding gear, etc. hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it. 
i went in early morning around 8:30. the cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside (ac switched off probably). there was no one behind the counter. asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order. 

ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll. the guy was coughing randomly (hopefully not into my food or drink), but i found this to be an annoyance. i mean, you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there aren't trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness, it all goes to waste. 

the mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was ok-ish. as i paid, i got a torn note, so i gave it back (to exchange it of course). instead the guy just took it and went away. i waited for a while, then called out. asked for my money and instead of one note, he handed over two. the dude was clearly in his sleep - probably having been through the night shift.

giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food. 1 point taken away for the serving attendant. 

oh, and they don't have anything non-veg.",4,Positive
"i was here with my bunch of friends a few days ago. i was in awe with this place and i guess anyone who visits here would also be, by the beautiful big toys this place has. from luxurious cars to super sexy sports bike, anything you want to rent this place has.
coming to the food, they don‚Äôt have much variety, it‚Äôs just pizza, pasta, sandwich and desserts. we had ordered veg pizza- loved it, loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust. four cheese pizza- i didn‚Äôt like it that much, made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust. veg sandwich- nailed it, it was the most yummiest one for me. paneer sandwich- my friends loved it, i don‚Äôt eat paneer so i can‚Äôt say that for myself. white sauce pasta- it was good, more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me.
coming to drinks, i ordered cool blue slush and i loved it taste wise , another reason being, it took too long to sipped up fully.
overall, it was a good experience for me.",4,Positive

we ordered cold coffee and capacuino. the cold coffee wasn't cold and the capacuino wasn't hot. disappointed with the temperature of the coffees served. i would give a 4* for its ambience. received a very small piece of chilly cheese toast. ccd serves better coffees.,3,Neutral
"super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype. we ordered:
‚ñ™mint mocha - which tasted ok
‚ñ™chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
‚ñ™mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
‚ñ™coffee crunch - it was good because i like chocolate and coffee combo. but for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
few good points:
‚ñ™vegetarian cafe
‚ñ™good location
‚ñ™good music
‚ñ™they buzz you when your food's ready

all i can say is (and i am saying this because i believe that everything can get better if you put effort) driven cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. we dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. and your selling point is not the ambience. you dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low. there's so much competition out there, you have to rev-up your game.
serve good food and bring your reputation up. challenge accepted?",2,Negative
"first thing which strikes is the ambience and the big toys, everyone who will visit this place for sure wld be in awe of the ambience and the big toys i was in hurry and only had cappuccino and it was very good and specially 100 bucks for a cappuccino like that, bang on! but i was not impressed by the service it can surely be improved",3,Neutral

this place is known for its rusty garage-like interiors, where you can rent some top notch automobiles. the cafe in ""driven cafe"" is rather disappointing, staff isn't very friendly, nor very observant to details. they ask for extra money for everything even when the coffee costs similar to expensive coffee chains. i had mocha and coffee crunch, both of which were average at its best and weren't something that i would remember.",2,Negative

pizza is also good . the quality of cheese in pizza can be slightly better i feel. coffee even with an extra shot didn't give a strong aroma though",3,Neutral
"ambience is quite good and this place is nearby to my office. i was disappointed with the food though. certainly , dint reach to my expectations and the blue berry cheese cake that i had in other cafe's was *wow* , but the one here was bland . the shakes were good compared to the rest that i ordered. service was good so i would give a 4/5 . food - 2/5 ambience - 4/5",3,Neutral
"driven cafe is the new age ccd.
govthere, chill as much as you want and call for one of their low standard of coffee.

"to all bike and car lovers. this is the best place to hang out and also to rent amazing sport, cruiser, naked street bikes and cars.

"love this place from the word go. i always wanted to visit this cafe since it's launch. everything about this place is super cool - be it the timing, concept, ambiance or the quality of coffees and snacks served. i visited this place on a bright sunday morning and just fell in love with the place as i got a seat right next to muscular triumph. they have great collection of cars and bikes, which even one can hire on rent. i ordered hazelnut coffee, paneer kulcha and my friend ordered some dry fruits crispy sweet croissant along with coffee. paneer kulcha was too good and coffee was just fine. would visit this place again soon.",4,Positive
"after a lot of reco-s and solid rating everywhere, i finally tried out driven cafe - mainly to sample their coffee. unfortunately, i was disappointing with the cappuccino. tried a 'medium' cappuccino - which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk, and it was very underwhelming. no aroma, no kick, it was very bland and generic. had a hard time getting through it. 
the wife tried frappe, which was as per her taste and my daughter (who has a major sweet tooth) found her choco chip brownie nice. however, i was quite disappointed overall.",3,Neutral
"must visit place for supercars and super bike lovers. these fantastic machines will definitely enthral your looks. coming to the ambience the environment of the place looks like you're literally sitting in a garage, between few superbikes. the blackcurrant milkshake tasted really great but the pizza didn't taste that good. if it was made a little spicy it would be great, but the chilly flakes saved it from being a total disappointment.
can definitely give this place a try.",4,Positive
"the food was not at all good. though the ambience was very nice and soothing to the eye, the food was just bad. we ordered chili cheese toast, chocochip brownie and chocochip cookies. except for the cookies, nothing was good. while the brownie tasted like some kind of medicine, the toast was just too hard and very difficult to chew.",1,Very Negative
"if midnight hunger strikes you, driven cafes are the best place to rush to. aura is compact and beautiful, and the playlist they play is quite catchy. i was really amused to visit this place last night.",4,Positive
the place is good and the ambience too but the food is expensive and lacks taste.for bike lovers it's a place to try on and just have a normal breakfast can't prefer more than that.,3,Neutral
"the best thing about this cafe is that it is open 24x7.
there are lot of beverage options, a few bakery options and very little food options. the ambiance is great for bike enthusiasts, but if you aren't one it is only average for you. they play really good music though.
the food is only average.",3,Neutral
"the ambience is quite a steal! such interiors and those amazing cars and bikes lined up outside üòç a must visit for bikers cause they even have fancy merchandise inside.

this place being really close to our residence, we are frequent visitors. the best part is that it‚Äôs open late in the night hours. you can just have a drink and chill in the outdoor seating area. pure bliss!

i‚Äôve tried the cafe mocha,mint mocha- strong minty flavour, hot chocolate: all equally good. the snacks are quite average and can be avoided. the chilli cheese toast is a disappointment.

sizzling brownie was yum and so was pesto pasta though it was slightly overpriced.


one of the cool places to enjoy and try different coffee drinks, i must say. üòáü§òüèΩ",4,Positive
"this place excites me everytime i go, my most fav midnight hangout place with friends. i've been a fan of this cafe not just because of the bikes, cars and badass ambience but their excellent coffes too. they serve one of the hyderabad's best espressos along with few other cold coffees and shakes. but, there are less snacks options. my suggestion would be to increase the snacks options and adding some exotic desserts like sizzling brownies.",5,Positive

great place to spend time. nice ambience and music. i am an automobile enthusiast and this place is really nice. super cars and bikes on rent are parked outside. the fruit cakes and coffee flavours are also nice. some variety of drinks are not available at timea which is a turn down. but good place to relax and sip coffee.,4,Positive
"what's not to love here ... the best and the most amazing combination of car/bike and coffee...
soo you have to to visit either if u like sporty bike and luxurious cars or coffee is life for you ..
it has rustic ambience which you will fall for and service is quite fast ...",5,Positive
"it is my late night stop when i am in need for a coffee. have been there dozen of times. the most eye catchy thing about the cafe is the super bikes and cars parked outside. the cafe has a rustic ambiance and is decorated with bikes and posters.

i usually end up having a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate. i loved them both.

so if you are craving for a coffee in the middle of the night then this is the place to go. not only this, they have amazing cars and bikes for rent.

so a must visit place !! üòäüòä",4,Positive
"nice place. coffee is nice. stays open till midnight which is great for people who work late night and are in need for a good coffee. we had double chocolate decadent which is ok, as we had better before. plus it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs made fresh. coffee was nice as it can get better.",3,Neutral

the one and only best place to chilll out with super cars and super bikes on weekends is this driven cafe and the food is also super awesome here but lil expensive but food worth it you can drive the super cars and super bikes in this cafe by taking it for rent for some time but the place is super awesome with #supercarsandbikes #superweekends,5,Positive
two thumbs up for coffee! one of the most authentic places for coffee in hyderabad! tried and tasted all the flavors.... as a coffee connoisseur they made me happy!  :) a quick meeting with cheerful and smiling ashwin jain was a bonus..... the service was impeccable...... ultimate customer delight! snacks could be better though.,4,Positive
"one of the second best places for. me to have coffee in hyderabad after starbucks.. the ambience of the cafe is awesome with all the superbikes and super cars. the service is decent. and the its quite reasonable to spend on coffee and food. the most interesting part is about the interiors of the cafe where it is all metallic and the paintings are awesome..

"my go to cafe for any discussion or meeting. have been to this place more than 10 times by now, and never get disappointed.
the ambience stands out from all the nearby places, with whole garage theme. if you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well! too much innovation and thinking, is just mind blowing. the wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic. the cherry on top is their songs selection.

all the coffees taste great, especially the fact you get it even after midnight. although my personal favourites are flat white and cappuccino. the quite bites available as paneer kulcha is recommended as well. 

don't forget to take good camera along with you while going here.",5,Positive
"what catches your eyes could be the expensive cars and super bikes (which you could rent), but once you enter inside the place - you have to flex your muscles to push the door which has a heavy chain- you get a good feeling. the place offers you some interesting food options to choose from and the garage feeling gives a huge rush. the antique furniture at places adds some uniqueness to the conversation.. must visit for quick friendly hangout..",4,Positive

"great place to hangout and chill with friends. we just went for a drive around 12.30 and ended up here !
the ambience was pretty cool !
we tried garlic bread, with brownie and a cold coffee !
brownie was little disappointing i would say, too sweet !
though coffee was pretty good !
garlic bread was ok , it could have been little more crisp !
will definately like to try out once more with pizzas and pasta !",3,Neutral
"if bikes, cars and coffee are your weaknesses then the driven cafe is no less than heaven for you. their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous ford-mustang-5, premium porsche-911 carrera-4s0, the hulk of bikes triumph-rocket-iii, speedy suzuki-hayabusa and the kinetic kawasaki-zx14r- which is also one of the world‚Äôs fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website. at present, their fleet consists of 150 cars, 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles.

if this doesn‚Äôt satisfy the gearhead inside you then there‚Äôs some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night!

the place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum. the ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages. it is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff. the cafe also has a store which sells/rents biking accessories including biking jackets, helmets and other accessories.

coming to the food now, the first thing we had here was the chili cheese toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo. it was quite filling and really tasty. next up was the flavourful apple pie with ice-cream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with ice-cream.

this was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee. the ‚Äòselfie coffee‚Äô has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink. this is one-of-a-kind experience. you click a selfie and whatsapp that on a number, they‚Äôll print that particular selfie on the coffee.

lastly we had the turkish baklava twins which were crunchy, nutty, flaky and really delicious. the place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included colombian coffee, death wish, illy monka, birch coffee, araku tribal coffee, organic decaf peppermint mocha and many more.

the place is definitely a must go!

"explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long. has an american cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 am at least. the cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and latte coffee were pretty good. it's self service and the order came in pretty quick. one and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite. amit agrawal harsh jhunjhunwala poorvi agarwal",3,Neutral
"well been to this place for 4 times now, the reason being it's unique ambience, peace and the opportunity nto spend quality time.

would have given it a 5 but the place has lost a bit of it's charm recently.

i ordered reshmi chicken kebab wrap, cheese melt chicken wrap & chicken rice feast

what was good?

food arrived on time and was hot.
neatly packed.

attractive packaging.

above all, the taste. the products tasted real good.

i feel the cheese üßÄ on my mouth when i was having the cheese melt wrap. chicken was tender and cooked real soft. they are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. wrap was cooked equally good.

reshmi chicken kebab wrap was awesome. it gave a different taste altogether.

highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. it can be had by both - children and elders. they have two differential cooked chicken on the top. both are boneless and cooked with perfection. only the ingredients differ.

"i just love the wraps of faasos and can have them at any time .i mainly like their three wraps - cheesy corn salsa wrap,mac n cheese wrap and veg pizza wrap. all of them are amazing but pizza wrap is just mind blowing.they have multiple options for the bread of the wrap as well - multigrain, crispy bake,lacha parantha etc.

pizza wrap has cheese, vegetables and other sauces in it. it gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.the size is big and is good enough as a meal for one person

i have also tried chola kulcha and veg thali from faasos but in bangalore,they were also very good.

i have tried almost all of their major wraps :

pizza wrap (5/5)
mac n cheese wrap (4.5/5)
cheesy corn salsa(4/5)

"navratri review program~

i ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast. the packaging was good and the order was delivered on time. the thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts ,curd, sabudana kheer, paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry. everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. there could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. the taste was no doubt best. fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together. it was a little expensive though but it's worth it.üòÄ unique menus are always welcome.

"#navratrifoodreview


got a chance to review their navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with singhada ke aloo parantha,paneer makhanwala,sabudhana ki kheer,green tomato curry and curd. best part was paneer makhanwala , it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha üéâ the meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting! i rated it 4 because of spilling of oil and tomato which is a bit half cooked else everything was perfectly enroute deli ‚ô•Ô∏è

"my actual rating is 3.5...i ordered veg wraps few days back.. service was quick..i must say packaging was really good..

i ordered veg cheesy melt paneer wrap and paneer tikka wrap. they also served tikha masala with wrap..those who love spicy food must like this masala...

cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..it has punjabi flavor with cheese combination..loved it..

paneer wrap - it was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

my experience was good..

"#vegetarian review

i got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review.
if you've to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll. it had right amount of spices. the cheese paneer roll was too bland. it had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty.

the quantity was good enough for one. would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination.

however, do try the paneer tikka masala roll if you're craving for some snacks‚ù§Ô∏è",3,Neutral

i had ordered the cheesy chicken bhuna wrap and the jumbo chicken wrap from here. this was by invitation only and was for tasting. the cheesy wrap was great and was filled with cheese in every bite. the chicken jumbo wrap actually had loads of chicken with my favorite variety being the chicken meatball. this is definitely a must try and is also a part of their signature wraps.,4,Positive
the one i ordered (chicken wrap) would have been 5 star but the amount of salt you added was unbearable. do something about it and also the rice dish was fine,3,Neutral
ordered jumbo paneer tikka rice fest. first of all it was nowhere near to being jumbo. simply a small box and they call it ‚Äòjumbo‚Äô. probably they have studied english from some remote island. secondly the rice was so damn spicy that i am facing issues in my stomach after having them. this was my first and last order from fassos. will never ever order again from here.,1,Very Negative

"ordered two wraps for dinner. they filled my appetites quite well. i really would appreciate the way packing was done, and if your tongue prefers spicy meals, you also get an option of spicy masala.
jumbo veg wrap - 4.5/5 was quite delectable, it included paneer, onion, potatoes mashed masala, mayonnaise.
cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above i expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.

taste is awesome.... no complaints what so ever... it's fresh and tastes good... only concern is the way the delivery person handles the food...

last time the pizza arrived cold... completely cold... today pizza came dismantled... it was brought upside down by the delivery person...

one suggestion to management... pls instruct the delivery team to handle the food with more care and respect... otherwise you will lose your customers... see the photos and know it yourself",4,Positive
"staying in ramky towers we frequent this place quite often. although little did we know how incredibly disrespectful the staff really is. we found a hair in an ice cube inside the iced tea, when informed the staff on the counter about it , they willingly accepted it without checking. 10 minutes later one of the staff folks comes back saying "" are you sure there is a hair "". only to find out they had removed the ice cube which had the hair. after quite a discussion they brought the executive chef ( who literally just stood there with absolutely no contribution to the discussion) eventually when one of the staff's members (nandu in the photo) asserted that he'll personally pay for it we asked for the owner's contact, who then waived off the bill. all in all sincerely disappointed with the attitude of the staff.",1,Very Negative

amazing food. a really good variety of muffins in the menu. my favourite is the blueberry muffin which one should definitely try. goes light on the pockets as well. must visit if you want to just talk and spend some quality time with your friends. right opposite deloitte in gachibowli makes it easily accessible as well. will definitely visit again.,5,Positive

we had a chicken makhani pizza. the pizza was very good and it was made with thin crest. the ambience was also good. the bakery products in display also seemed to be fresh and delicious, though couldn't taste them. pricing wise, it is a bit on the higher side i felt.
overall it was a good experience here at this place and i would rate this as
food - 4/5
ambience - 4.5/5
service - 4/5",4,Positive
"we ordered a double margherita pizza and white sauce pasta. the texture of white sauce was off and it was very clumpy (the pasta was still very hot). the pizza was fine taste wise but it can't be called a margherita pizza (had few strands of shredded basil that was dry). all the sachets of oregano seasoning expired 3 months ago, in june and when we opened the sachets there were a lot of clumps. it's okay not to give any seasoning if you don't have it but sending expired stuff is completely unacceptable. the delivery and packing was good. wish they had paid same attention to the food.",2,Negative
"one of the nicer places in hyderabad whether it is for an evening cup of coffee or breakfast.

"this place has freshly baked stuff, probably the best you'd find in this locality but the beverages are just about average!

the danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since i am quite frequent here. all cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. the mushroom spinach puff is good. special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. for the main course, i've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. so all my points go for the food here.

capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.

pretty ambience, good food and not that great drinks!",4,Positive
"my absolute go-to- place! this place is a blessing for me since it serves amazing coffee. also absolutely near to my office so i can hop in whenever i want.

"the old madras baking company. how posh does it sound and what a spectacular ambience. this place is a must try for breakfast lovers! üòé

they have really amazing bread rolls and bakery items available for purchase. i‚Äôve tried their garlic bread, the english bread, their croissants, chocolate muffins, custard and chocolate danish, brownies: all worth it!

over breakfast, i tried the triple cheese sandwich- found it quite average, the white sauce pasta was delicious though. i‚Äôve also tried the mushroom sandwich with other veggies: super amazing!

although the price point is probably a little on the higher side, it‚Äôs worth a try!üôÇ",4,Positive
"whenever i crave to have a good cup of coffee, this is the place i want to head to!

their madras coffee is soothing, refreshing and amazing!!
i tried their cappuccino, but i will go back to have the madras coffee again probably!!

they bake their own breads, so the sandwiches are a must try!
we ordered grilled chicken sandwich and egg sandwich with focaccia bread and trust me they were mouth watering!! the stuffing was adequate, and it had the perfect crunch!!

also i will vouch for their grilled chicken salad. it is loaded with chicken and veggies and are so filling!!

they also have counter with freshly baked cakes, muffins, breads and cookies!!

so, though the menu isn‚Äôt that elaborate but whatever they are offering it is quite good!!
price wise its ok with the quality and the quantity of the stuff they are providing!
they have both indoor and outdoor seating area..so do choose according to the weather outside!!
though the service is bit slow, you can relax by sipping a cup of coffee...chatting away or reading a book in cafe!! right!",4,Positive

the place is tad bit pricy but worth it.",4,Positive

"we had gone to old madras baking company in the past for buying bread but never sat down and had a meal there. we were out on a saturday morning to check out a house right opposite this place. it was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here. the place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.

my husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. i'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. we ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. the bagel was amazing with the coffee. i'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. we made a pact to go for breakfast every saturday mornings after this because i realised what an important meal i was missing due to my laziness :)

would recommend this place to everyone for sure. i for sure am going back again for the bagels and coffee!",5,Positive
"it's a nice, cozy cafe and has a pleasant ambience. i tried the red velvet pastry here, decent enough i would say! coffees at the place are also worth a try!",4,Positive
filter coffee croissant cravings get satiated here. it hums with a beat synced with mine. tasting one at a time to control calories. they have got a wide array of goodies. custard bun banana cake danish etc etc. variety of cheese preserves pickles. if they can get their over the door air blowers to keep the flies away... i would have given 5*.,4,Positive

the the chicken on the sandwich was stale and inedible . highly unprofessional from a restaurant like yours i want my money refunded,1,Very Negative
"the old madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor.

the coffee is quite good, with a lot of variations available. the best part is the freshly baked breads. those beautiful, soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter. even the puffs and victoria cake are nice to have.

coming to the worst part - the service. in all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place. almost always, i had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over. second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating. more often than not, you can see flies buzzing over the tables. though the kitchen looks quite hygienic.",3,Neutral

"this place is located near the hdfc bank inside the meenakshi bamboos commercial complex in the gachibowli area. i went there along with a friend as i read great reviews about their doughnuts and cakes.

my first impression about this place was that it had a nice decor and relaxed seating areas, both indoor and outdoor. we went there around 1 p.m. and it was very hot, so we opted for sitting indoor.

we tried many cakes, cookies and doughnuts here and i liked most of them but my favorite are:

a) red velvet doughnut [rs.60] which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling.

b) salted nutella doughnut [rs.75] which was very soft and stuffed with nutella.

c) banana cake [rs.155] which was moist, soft and cake like sweet bread.

d) dark chocolate cookie [rs.50] which was once again very soft but was not too sweet.

they bake fresh bread everyday and each of their items look so good. there is a variety of options like bagels, custard buns, brownies and croissants. i also tried their multi grain bread which has flax seeds, millets and other healthy seeds. it was totally yummy!

worth the price you pay for and for conscious eaters there's always an option here. they will customise food for you.",5,Positive

"though i had very less variety of food here, i am quite impressed with their quality and taste. really appreciate the ambience, pretty clean place. their speciality is breads, try their bread for sure. garlic bread is awesome here.
very detailed menu and professional to core, they stick to basics and don't try to satisfy every cuisine.",4,Positive

"i was searching for a good veg place around gachibowli to host my daughters 1st bday and ended up with lime. dinesh was the manager and he made sure the menu and other arrangements are all taken care off. over all i was happy with the way it went except for few points to caution. 

my personal fav foods - 
- welcome drink - pan shots
- starters - yum banana tikki
- gravys - malai kofta
- noodles
- mango dal
- chats and chocolate gulabjamun
what is good :
- food is great in contrast to what we generally see in party places where the hall is free
- staff is friendly
- their roof top gives a different experience than a regular ac hall

things to keep in mind :
- the mic system caused issues which spoiled the party mood. they have good mic system, please make sure its in working condition and there is av operator in stand by through out the party
- this place is strictly for a small group. statis crowd should not exceed 60 - 65 pax. you can enjoy the place to fullest with 50-60 pax.
- since it is roof top, summers can be pain ful even with coolers. there is always this tension of rain ;p

with the above exceptions, i loved the place. their suite rooms are one of the best in the area at a reasonable price. their ala carte menu also serves the best veg food in this part of the city.",4,Positive
"really don't go with rating. we had here in the evening and trust me food was not at all good and coming to service, they are damn slow. 90% items in the menu are unavailable. only available items will be served 40mins later your order. even people were very few when we visited here. waste of money and time",1,Very Negative
"you need at least 2 hrs time to get your food prepare. better go for other restaurant instead of ordering food from it.
i have ordered food from it and they either cancel or take 2 hr to just prepare your food.",2,Negative

i booked the lime for catering for a private occasion for a gathering for around 80 guests. to start with they are very professional in getting the arrangements clear to customer and provide all necessary details about the services to be provided on event day. on event day they were sharp on time and had all things well set before guests started coming in. starters and welcome drinks were floated to the guests nicely. the main course and desserts were also pretty delicious. overall i was extremely impressed and satisfied with the services and highly recommend it for any events.,5,Positive

the birthday party was a huge hit with guests raving about the food. the starters were yummiest amongst all. baby corn chilli garlic is the best. bajjis were very hot and good. the highlight of the day was signature drink from the lime. it was lemonade kind. guests were
enjoying it alot.
we wanted no onion no garlic items in t
the menu. dal was very tasty without onions and garlic. elders were surprised to see that in a restaurant they could get it.
one of my relatives commented that he ate such great spread after 10 years in a restaurant.

we used catering service from squeeze @ the lime for our kid's birthday at our community premises. we received compliments on food from most of our guests. the service was good and there was issue even when our guest count was more than what we estimated. we have chosen squeeze @ the lime for our kid's b'day party as we found it very good when we attended few parties at roof top banquet. it is the best place if you are planning to have a party with around 90-100 guests. i look forward for another event with squeeze @ the lime.,4,Positive
"i recently hosted my child's birthday party on the terrace of the lime. the arrangements was really good, the service was par excellence. the ambiance of the place is awesome.a host is happy when guests are, and every guest called up to appreciate the food. thank you, dinesh (fnb manager) to take keen interest and making sure that the team takes an extra mile to make the event a successful one. i would really recommend lime for their quality and service",5,Positive

"the quality of the food is bad. the noodles, starter and the sweet, everything was drenched in heavy oil. the taste itself shows that the oil used is also of low quality. rather than spending on the packaging of the food, they could have spent some money on providing health food.",1,Very Negative

"i have been a regular online customer of squeeze @ the lime, gachibowli for nearly two years. when it comes italian food, especially the spaghetti pasta (aglio olio), this restaurant serves the best in hyderabad. trust me, i have tasted the said pasta in several restaurants in the city. but squeeze @ the lime's spaghetti and porcini aglio alio beats them all!",5,Positive
"this place is for those who love the aromas of ""lemon grass"".....you get to taste the shoots of it in their dishes too.    

i visited this place for about 6 times with family, friends & colleagues (reunions).  every time i happened to have a variety to taste....especially the soup and the platter is colourful.....the starters. in fact to be precise.....like the ""death by chocolate"" in icecreams, their specialty is ""death by starters"".....they are just enough for your craving muscles & blends of buds. 

the hospitality is a near very good and courtesy is the topping on the ice.  my 3 cheers and 5 thumbs for this place.

"simply the best place in town for hosting a party specially if you are looking for a pure vegetarian authentic north indian food. i hosted a lunch party for about 40 adults and 15 kids today and what a memorable experience we had!! it was an important personal occasion for me and i wanted it to be a memory for lifetime and lime staff (specially the manager, dinesh) made sure that it happens just that way!. food was excellent. starters were plenty and each one of them was outclassing the other one in taste. my guest just kept asking for more and more and lime staff kept serving them without any fuss!. i just loved their ajwaini paneer tikka, corn manchurian and cottage cheese pizza. pain puri and dahi puri were good too. and yes, the delicious manchow soup that we opted instead of tomato soup they offered by default. main course was also matching with the high expectations that starters set. all curries were great in taste, rotis and naan were served hot and whenever one wants. rice item were also good (didn't try one myself but as told by my guests). they served jalebi with rabadi and chocolate gulabjamoon as desserts and everyone just loved them.

would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff. they were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own! what more i could have asked for. at the end special thanks to lime manager dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had. i would strongly recommend this place if you want a memory for a very long time.",5,Positive
"this place is easily one of the best exclusive vegetarian restaurants in hyderabad. their food menu is exhaustive; includes all cuisines from south indian, italian, orient, thai and our favourite north indian. and the best part is, all of them are mouth watering-delicious. the staff is very friendly and the service is impeccable. the prices are affordable too. i was pleasantly surprised when i looked at the prices as the taste and quality was way above what they charge. i‚Äôm gonna visit this place atleast once every fortnight!",5,Positive

be any cuisine, they do justice to it. whether it's chinese, indian or italian, everything tastes good. it's a must visit for a vegetarian food lover.

must try are soups and chinese starters.

now the downside: the buffet here is ok and cheap. not sure why the quality gets degraded in buffet but same tastes good in alacarte.",4,Positive
"great vegetarian food. either you have food at their outlet or order home or go for their catering services for party, they serve amazing food. food options are decently good and staff is very courteous. for a small scale party recently i took their catering services and i must say all my guests and family were delighted with the diverse menu as well as quality of food. great job squeeze lime team: mr. raj, mr. dinesh thanks for great food and excellent coordination.",4,Positive

"i recently had team lunch here. it was a buffet lunch and i got surprised for their price, it was 300 on weekdays. they have good starter like pizza slices, pani and dahi puri, banana cutlet and one manchuriya. then there is enough item for main course. its not much specious place so i would say book a table before visiting. over all i found this place good and value for money.",4,Positive

the food is okay not great, doesn't really live up to the hype. tundey kebab was good but a little bit on spicy side. rajwada ghost was awesome.

goodespecially the kabsa laham. its a must have for everyone. grilled chicken was a let down though

the staff wasn't very welcoming when we mentioned we will using dineout for payments and you could sense their attitude change. the ambience is pretty standard and looks empty.",3,Neutral

fantabulous ambience with great food royalty can be experienced at khaan saab . tundey kebab will be stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try, staff were brilliant,courteous, friendly too, they even had pan, which was delicious.

we went for lunch in weekday. restaurant is with ok ambience and nizam style plates and glasses. ordered biryani. biryani full of masala and little rice. jyadha masala thoda rice. food taste is ok but not worth it. food cost is peeeeeeekss. one water bottle cost is 47rs. highly costly food.,2,Negative

"fantabulous ambience with great food. royalty can be experienced at khaan saab. went there for new year's dinner with family and the food we tried were yummy & lip smacking. dhahi ki galouti will stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try. other dishes we tried were paneer ka soola in veg, lal mirch ka teekha tikka in non veg, hari mirch ki roti in breads & angarey jamum in desserts. all of them were exceptionally good. only thing we felt was prices are steep for the quantity they serve. but all is well when the food is great and ambience is awesome.",5,Positive
"as the tag line itself says be the royal guest, khaansaab actually keeps up with it. you are indeed welcomed as a royal guest here. filled with its authentic awesome delicacies, its an ideal place for a quality dining with family as well as friends.
rajwada raj gosht is a must try, i bet you would be mesmerized by the tender lamb pieces in the spicy curry.",5,Positive
"since there was a party going on in the main restaurant we have been diverted to a subsidiary of the same.

literally worthless. a shame to the fane of khaansaab.

open doors, full of mosquitoes, no captain to advice on the order, no proper care.

been the worst dinner experience ever. and to have that on the day of my wedding anniversary was disastrous.

ruined my date.

will never ever return here.

thanks for totally ruining my date.",1,Very Negative
"went out for casual family dinner, tried the palak chat for starters it was yummm, worth a try. also tried mutton galawti kebab and a fish starter. mutton kebabs were really good, fish starter took lot of time to get served and still lacked the taste, but disappointed with the fish starter.ordered peshawari chicken and few naans for the mains, both the gravy and naans were up to the mark. biryani was also decent. it‚Äôs a place worth a try.",4,Positive
"want to experience the royal food and service?? visit this place and you won't be disappointed. perfect place to experience the rich favor of north indian dishes. ambience is good with dim lighting. service is good with friendly staff.
delicious food. would highly recommend the burani paratha. do try other dishes too.
and yeah ambience of banjara hills branch is better.",4,Positive

it is pricey and is definitely not value for money.",2,Negative

"it was a thursday night that we decide to go to this khaan saab - and get the feeling of being a royal guest!

the ambience inside and the interiors were definitely apt to their punch line - it gives you the royal feeling

we ordered main course only as we were way too hungry !

butter naan
punjabi kulcha
chicken kurchan
chicken khandar

first of all i felt the pricing was a bit expensive but for the ambience and the royalty of the place i would buy it if the food is also that good!

the butter naan had loads of butter to our delight and were very soft and worth it!
the kulcha had potato filling but we expected it to be a bit more surprising given it was punjabi kulcha
both the side dish had shredded chicken in gravy.
we were 7 people so while ordering when we ordered only two sides the waiter told us that one side dish suffices for only 2 or at max 3 people.
given the price 380 we were amazed to hear this.
however we ordered only 2 and when the food arrived we understood why the waiter said so in the first place.

so we ordered one side dish later on and enjoyed the food. the taste and the quality was really excellent for all the money.

however there was another thing which stopped me from giving a 5 star rating to the place.
we asked for the bill and everything in it was justified except the charge for water

we had ordered regular water so theu gave 3 500ml aquafina bottles and later on they gave a 1 litre bottle.

and they charged 150 for that in the bill, quite ironical when the mrp is 10 for these bottles
they charge gst and they charge water at such a idiotic price.

we clicked many pictures near the giant elephant near the entrance. the whole place was very well decorated and i could easily spend one hour just clicking pictures.",4,Positive
"be it food quality or taste or guest treatment or ambience, awesome will be the only word to describe the experience. rarely i‚Äôve experienced such quality of food whose taste is unique and really stands out. would love to visit again with friends & family. a special mention about restaurant manager mr pandab for his brilliant guest management skill and absolutely polite approach.",5,Positive
"i ordered noodles and manchurian combo from this place, first of all i would like to suggest management to send fork along with the food as they have only sent the spoons and needless to say you cannot eat noodles from spoon. second the quantity was really less of manchurian. some improvement in food is suggested",3,Neutral

in food, i tried paneer tikka masala, masala kulcha, and some masala papad. all of them were pretty good. it has the complete feel of a family restaurant and the prices are also pretty reasonable. the quantity of the food is decent as compared to the price.

"it was my 4th order with olive garden in the last 6 months.  i loved the food from this place and this is the reason i ended up ordering from here multiple times.

this time it was a total disappointment in terms of the veg food and the service that was provided.

there was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for veg dum biryani & veg pulao.  both of these dishes were same i don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.

in terms of the service, i ordered the food from zomato at 8.00pm and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55pm.  i ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.

i would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with biryani & pualo.

service wise i would rate this place a 2.5

the manager/executive from the restaurant to whom i spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins.",3,Neutral
"after getting suggestion from one of my friends, we went tonight there for the dinner. we were two and ordered tandoor chicken, virgin mojito cocktail, veg fried rice and schezwan chicken...all the items were extremely good and very tasty. the price of each item in the menu was satisfactory. the behavior of the staffs were also so calm and polite. they accepted zomato gold too. we appreciate the job of the cook and the staffs there. the decoration and the sweet 90s music made the dinner fantastic. loved to visit the restaurant and will surely visit again.",5,Positive
"we visited this place on a weeknight so there was very less crowd. the veg food was okay. on nonveg side we tried their buffet. they served soup with 2 starters, salad and some veg starters. the soup and the starters (the apolo fish and the chicken kebab which was not even close to any kebab) was good. the curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty. overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate. the place was comfortable and the service was quick.",4,Positive

"have been here many times. i was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006. its a quiet place and family friendly. the lift is old, dark and horrible. it feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. they tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. coming to the food. its just okay. nothing outstanding or too bad. starters and chicken items are usually good enough. their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. i couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. and yes i don't know why they have downgraded their crockery. they serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls.",3,Neutral

very limited starters and sweet items as compared to other nearby hotels.",1,Very Negative
read the reviews about this new place and ordered chicken dum biryani to try out. the quantity was ample and taste was also good. looking forward to go there personally and check out some of their dishes.,4,Positive
"we've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since i am a big fan of starters.
so as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the gachibowli area. the interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. the staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. as soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. the flavour in the biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near gachibowli. this is not a place to visit from a long distance.

starters non veg- appollo fish was very tasty and was on the spicy side, chicken tandoori was good. the chicken soup was thick and delicious.

maincourse- veg biriyani, chicken biriyani and white rice. chicken curry was tasty and the chicken was nicely cooked. the mutton curry was not up to the mark. there are different bread items like butter naan, kulcha and butter roti also. other items like veg curry, dal fry, rasam was ok.

desserts- fresh cut watermelon, ice cream, bombay halwa. the gulabjamun and the caramel custard was super delicious.

"new entry in zomato gold-
ambiance- 
olive garden is located at the time square, indira nagar beside dominos pizza. there is nothing much to say about the ambiance of olive garden restaurant. this restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. even on the saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
food-
we ordered chicken chatpati kebab as a starter cost approximately inr 255. the quantity of kebab was very less. they served kebab with the green pudina chutney. both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. then we ordered chicken dum biryani cost approximately inr 210.
this was the worst dum biryani i ever had, that i didn't even tasted like biryani. instead of dum, they added so much oil in that biryani. olive garden offers 1+1 dish on zomato gold membership.

veg white sauce pasta and chettinad chicken biryani for mains.. there was a lotttt of cheese in pasta.. taste was on another level.. biryani was spicy.. a little disappointed that the spice level dominated the flavor.. but rest of the items compensated for this..

there are numerous places across city for dum biryani and this is one of thr best. although the spices used and cooking process is same, every biryani in different in its flavour.

both chicken and mutton biryani are good and they also serve fish biryani here which is also a must try dish. kebabs are also very good here.
coming to ambience, its a huge place with chai cafe kind of ambiance but they also have ac hall for family section.
service is the only terrible thing here. even during the peek lunch time, they say biryani is over and fresh hundi is awaited, which is terrible.

"the classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. when your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. the service time was also too much. i found the waiters to be a little rude. i can sense their awkwardness in serving to an odia table themselves being odia. 
neways now coming on to the food. the chicken biriyani does taste good as far as hyderabadi biriyani is considered. other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in gachibowli, it has a long way to go.

gd‚Äôs is a place to go to have a gastronomic experience, not just in terms of the taste but also the theatrics.

the polite owner will always be around asking you about the burger and always taking care of anything the bakers want.

if you want to be more than just satisfied with your next burger, i suggest you stop by gd‚Äôs.",5,Positive

"#doyouknow? a burger is the short name but in fact called as hamburger and if you lay down all the hamburgers eaten my americans only in a year, it circles earth 32 times.!

so why burger topic now? because of my recent visit to ‚Äúgd‚Äôs‚Äù opp dlf that offers quick bites like, sandwiches, hot dog, grilled chicken starters & most importantly their famous mouthful sized burgers.
galaxy burger, no wonder a fast selling pick for its grilled buns crammed with two layered cheesy juicy meat that over salivates your palate. grilling bun might need a little tweak to avoid chewiness or i am that one unlucky chap! followed by brilliant #comettail hot dog with freshness in every bite and decent smokey #atomicwings with a sweet-tarty (bbd sauce) finish (but a little over grilled).
though many of them choose this place for their speciality meat burgers they do have good coverage for egg/veg‚Äôetarians and heard #antimatter burger is a worthy try. overall paid 480inr.

value for money yet filling one soul comfortably are the key reasons which can potentially bring you again.

"ordered from this place since i was on the lookout for a big fat juicy burger. they didn't disappoint. the galaxy burger that i ordered was huge. the chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well. the only thing i didn't like (i'm a fussy eater) was that the chicken wasn't a breast piece or some sort of filet. it had some loose pieces of fat or skin (which i'm not fond of) and that kinda put me off. a pounded chicken breast without all those ""things"" in between holding the flesh, would have been better. ultimately i took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately. taste was good though. 
still trying to find a burger that can satisfy me...",3,Neutral
the best steak burgers in hyderabad without a doubt.consistency to the ‚Äút‚Äù. the taste never alters. highly recommend all meat lovers to sink their teeth into the juicy steaks,5,Positive
"have been hearing a lot about this amazing burger place opposite to dlf, what an amazing join with live grill and freshly made burgers, loved the friendly staff and a uniquely named menu.. ordered galaxy and milky way burger which were amazing and cooked to perfection, the charcoal grill gives the burger a unique bbq taste with chunky chicken pieces in it!!

on rush hours the service time can go lengthy, limit parking space the shop shares a juice center which is a plus point to grab some quick fresh juice or soft drink to go with your burger, and is open all night!!

feels moderately over priced however considering it being surrounded by mnc""s and the taste maybe it's justified, and definitely it's a worth visiting place!",3,Neutral

really appreciate the service of the restaurant and the concerned behaviour of the owner for his customers. at first when i received the order the burger was cold due to late delivery but when i complained the owner personally called to me and apologised and repeated the order this time sending his own delivery person. and the burger was amazing. to the owner thank you for being so concerned. there are very few owners like you who make sure customer s are happy. keep it up :),5,Positive

gd‚Äôs barbecues and burgers is a small shop located exactly opposite to dlf office here they serve juicy and tender barbecues and burgers.
the burgers made here are really good they marinate the chicken with desi spices and herbs, they cook the chicken in such a way that it is tender and juicy.
this is not a place where you can sit with your friends and have a bite i recommend this place only if you‚Äôre street food lover and planning to grab something to eat on the go.

three layers of bbq chicken strips, a cheese slices and some lettuce. it's a nice tasting marinade but if only they didn't over cook it.
you keep the chicken juicy for that's what makes a burger. you'll need someone who understands the timing and temperature to keep the chicken juicy

i think we made a wise choice :)",4,Positive

"ordered cosmic and galaxy burgers from this place, the taste was distinctly different and delicious is an understatement. the chicken was tandoori style and not a patty so that was one new thing. it was juicy, cheesy and the bread was also fresh. this is the first indianised burger i had and i am in love with it. the galaxy one of too much for one, it is that filling. the cosmic is also same to taste but can be finished by one. the packaging was good and simple, and the burgers were moderately warm when they were delivered. it was a very good experienceüòã please give this place a try.",5,Positive

been there on a sunday night for a quick snack and ordered milky way burger and thunderstorm burger. these two burgers were different from each other in terms of texture.. milky way had shredded chicken combined with creamy mayo and a cheese slice. this is a must have for anyone with a craving for cheesy and creamy burgers.. thunderstorm had bbq chicken strips with a single cheese slice.. the burger just melts in your mouth.. must visit place for bbq lovers..,5,Positive

"i ordered the galaxy burger. burger and dip was poorly packaged and squashed inside the single layer of foil. could not find cheese inside the burger. expected more chicken(it was advertised as ""double layered""). for the price i paid(235+delivery), i expected more. burger was tasty.


edit: i am changing my rating to 5 stars. after talking to them, it seemed that this was an isolated incident of misbehaviour on the part of the delivery guy, and gd was in no way responsible for it. they apologized and gave me a free burger with the next order, which was in good condition and delicious.",5,Positive
"now that s what we call some authentic chicken burger. they can give the big names like burger king and mcd run for their money any fine day. these uber tasty charcoal grilled burgers are absolute food nirvana. the soft and tender chicken breast well coated with local desi masala(marinated ) are grilled till they turn golden brown. a double slice of the grilled breast serves as the filling for galactic burger; which is my personal favouritethe burger buns are soft and sweet.

they have other options too like hotdog and sandwiches which are damn tasty. basically their usp is the grilling process of marinated chicken breast which makes them uncontested winners of best burgers in cyberabad. the place is in mid of bustling dlf area which makes the place pretty accessible. you may have to be patient enough to catch hold of your burgers as it takes minimum 15 minimum to grill the patty. must visit place for mouth watering burgers.",5,Positive
"a hidden jewel serving probably the best burgers in hyderabad and that too at a steal of a price.

you probably wouldn't notice this joint infront of dlf hyderabad but for the crowd that throng during evening hours . and if you have had a burger or a hot dog here and there's simply no place you can go to satisfy the cravings they create .

do try their cosmic burger, paneer hot dog, paneer burger.

the sauces that they put with the cheese is lipsmacking.

i have been a fan and i'm a regular here. try and you won't be disappointed.

"a hidden treasure, you have to travel across to eat these heavenly burgers. a small place situated in dlf,
gd's is a very renowned place famous among people who work in the it hub and also students in the
same area. you can park your car, and explore this joyous ride. they have burgers like never before, all
named after the galaxy, stars and sky. gd is himself who got these after a lot of research and planned to
ditch his corporate job to start a journey with burgers, why? because he absolutely loves them. when
you head there, place your order, it takes a min hiimum of 20 minutes for your burgers to arrive as they
prepare all fresh on the live grill in front of you. the burgers are vegetarian, chicken, paneer, fish and
more that is grilled to perfection and topped it with your chosen flavours off the menu. the bread is soft
and straight out of the oven. they also have sandwiches, starters and hotdogs! try the mercury, it‚Äôs all
chicken strips with melted creamy cheese, the perfect burger for a rainy day. the venus if you are a
lamb fan, or the milky way if you love chicken with a lot of mayo. they also have neptune, made in
ferrero nuts, chicken and cheese. there is a special dip you will be served with and it‚Äôs out of the world!",4,Positive

"i was on a work in financial district and it happens to be lunch time, so finalised this place after some search, i parked my car outside and walked inside it was completely empty, as i enter into ac dining hall, man o man full of crowd, i literally waited for 15 minutes to find a table, as the staff is completely busy with existing orders not the new customers, so yeah, service needs to be improved. after finding a table i ordered jeera rice and kodi vepudu, liked the jeera rice alot and chicken was also good, next time i‚Äôll try some more. recommended place if you are a telangana cuisine lover.",4,Positive
"good out door sitting restaurant to spend some pleasent evening time. visited this place which to close to outer ring road and nankaramguda it offices. it's a quite and less crowded to have andhra style spicy food. we ordered babycorn manchuria, chicken lollipop and chicken biryani. food was bit spicy but manageable and good. chicken was well cooked and tasty. quantity was bit less when compared to it's price range and it's compititers. but still it can be miantained well

"since this place is close to my office and they serve south indian delicacies, i‚Äôve decided to go there with my team. this place has got that simple dhaba vibe and the food they serve is lip smacking. if you are non-vegetarian, this place is a must try. also, if you are here- do eat their kadhu ka kheer in desserts. ever since i‚Äôve tried that, i ensure that i order this every time i go there and recommend this to friends and this one has never let us down.",5,Positive
"me & my friend we're looking for quick lunch on a friday noon in financial dist and we spotted this place. decided to venture as this will be our first visit.

it's was exactly at 12.30 noon when we entered restaurant and found there was hardly any one. outside landscape, place for sitting is very good. there is in-house place with ac as well. we chose inside as it was already too hot. ambience is descent and nothing very special, but is good.

food we kept it simple as nawabi chicken kebab which was special on the day we visited and chicken biryani. kebabs were really nice. biryani was like fine. not so very delicious at same time it's not bad. service is fast.

while if you ask me will you visit the place again, i might start thinking as i found place outside more interesting than the food. that does not serve purpose. so, i am sure you got answer.

interesting was by time the clock ticked 12.45noon, my goodness entire place was filled with people and many we're waiting... that made us think, probably there is something else special about this place which we didn't order... so if at all i go there next time will see to it i taste it... üòÄ",3,Neutral
"we always use to order their kodi pulav (which tastes sooo good few times and just okay some other times) on zomato but recently we visited this place to have dinner

so we ordered chicken manchow soup which was okay okay in taste cuz manchow noodles are not fresh since i could smell the oil in noodles... but quantity of chicken in soup was good !

kothimeera kodi pulav (suggested by the server) is actually pretty tasty but i wish there was little more kothimeera in it ... taste was very good though..prices are little high",3,Neutral
"t-grill is on the main road next to icici campus in the financial dist, spread over an acre it has both indoor and outdoor seating. the outdoor seating is midst of neatly done green lawns with small and large hut shaped structures.

we started with grilled fish that was basa/cod fillet skewered upon coals; it was spicy and tasted well with green dahi chutney. the paya shorba/soup was extremely spicy but very tasty.  then we had kottimira chicken, mutton dalcha with bagara rice for the main course that came as a recommendation. pachipulusu with the bagara rice also tasted awesome. on the whole, all the dishes we tasted there were awesome except for the heat from the spice!

authentic telangana and andhra signature dishes! will definitely try again for the rest of the menu recommendations!",4,Positive

"one of the best places i have been to this winter, perfect ambience and what i loved the most was
to beat the cold they provide a hot charcoal basket beside every table..gives you the perfect winter warmth, even on a busy day of the week the service was on spot, just like a dabha where everything seemed to be on the move and full of buzz üôÇ the food was always known to be typical telangana food but somehow felt it was a little close to telangana cusine and more of a quick dabha serve..loved the ragi sangati combo perfect bowl of rangi sangati with a dollop of ghee with 4 accompaniments like mutton pickle, chicken curry, daal and pachi pulusu, ordered their famous pulavs as well.

ambience : 4.5 (stole my heart with the charcoals)
taste : 3.5 (would love more authenticity)
service: 4
quantity : 3 (can improve a little for the price point)
value for money : 3 (maybe because it is located in gachibowli)

"my friend ordered the ulavacharu chicken bone pulao from t-grill. the price was high, but the taste justified it. it is one of the spicier foods i tried in hyderabad. i always though hyderabadi food was spicy. but, i never came across anything very spicy. this one was spicy enough to be memorable. it's one of the best pulaos i've ever had. you will definitely love it.",5,Positive

i've not seen anyone come here to try their chinese and vegetarian as i don't think it would stand out at all. but again, their bheja fry, their iguru, their kheema and the meats that they have are amazing!!! their bagara rice along with the kheema and mutton iguru was too too good.

i'll definitely give them a try again at least to check out the daily specials.",4,Positive

service- the parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated. the delivery boy called once he was outside our society. 3/5

presentation/packaging- it was a usual packing. nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it. 3/5

food- food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added. we tried the following-:

paneer pulao- it had a nice quantity, sufficient for two. there were average number of paneer pieces. it tasted quite yum. the masala was ample inside. too spicy which killed it's essence. 3.5/5

gobi 65- a good quantity for two, it tasted like a typical fried gobi. nothing extraordinary, the usual. 3/5

will i order from here again? i will only if they decrease the spice level. despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction, it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water.",3,Neutral

"a randomly sudden decision took me and a couple of my colleagues to this place on a weekday lunch. we were unsure of our choice when we saw a few people sitting under the open huts and dining in the heat wave. but the moment i opened what seemed like a kitchen door, i was thrown aback to see 100s of people belting some south indian meat. man, this place is an oasis in the puppalguda desert!
we being mutton lovers, ordered a nalli starter and charcoal mutton chops. looking at the crowd we were mentally prepared to go back to office in the evening post chai break but the waiter promptly brought the food in less than 10 minutes with a scalpel like tool with which we were to operate the nalli. our eyes shone. the nalli did not disappoint us. we then dug into the chops. all my hours spent in drooling at pork ribs on youtube were redeemed. this mutton chops did the deed. the meat wasn't the slimy, fatty kind melting off the bones, but was the perfectly grilled meat willing to separate from the ribs at our mildest effort. we were already dreaming of another plate but decided against it in the best interests of our bellies. then came the main course - rotis, mamasam pachadi and chicken biriyani. first bite of the mamasam pachadi threw our chairs back by 5 feet. we decided to ask the waiter to pack the biriyani and order another round of rotis to honour the pachadi. for a person who consciously keeps away from gongura chutneys, this one which clearly had gongura was just perfectly sour - a bit more sour and i wouldn't have cared to write this review. the meat was invisible. we had to spot a narrow bone in the pachadi to even know there was mutton. it was just mystically omni present in the meat. i guess this is what you would call divine food.

"on the way back home from mrugavani national park, had a stop here for lunch. i really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing. first impression, no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it, all were parked zigzag, welcomed by foul odour at that point.
huge place, but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further, like where to sit or dine, especially if it was first time like me. initially noticed an outdoor seating, organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables. felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn't make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors, also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread. no one cared to guide until i personally asked of any indoor is available.
so shifted to inside dining room, great relief finding at a corner a place for us. our order was veg platter - not worth price, taste, quantity. jumbo chicken biryani - evenly cooked, tender chicken, not so flavorful, mutton biryani is good.
service lag, may be of huge rush. missing fine dine features, asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside.
village back drop artifact, greenery are little bit saviors. may be at evening hours, outdoor seating could be good choice. anyway no thrill at t grill.",3,Neutral

ordered because i wanted to eat momos so much and dlf area is popular for street food but i am disappointed! the momos were undercooked and dry. had ordered two veg steamed momos and i felt sad because it neither fulfilled my cravings nor it filled my tummy. the closings were hard and uneatable.,1,Very Negative
"so it‚Äôs 11:30 on a friday night, most of the restaurants are closed and we are hungry. we find this restaurant still delivering with ratings more than four. we order veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos. we get the delivery on time and the food is not bad. schezwan sauce is steamy hot and delicious; but both the momos on the drier side. hence going with 3/5 for this restaurant.",3,Neutral
"i ordered the steamed chicken and fried chicken momos.
the momos are pretty terrible, especially considering how much they are asking for it. i've had cheaper and better momos from roadside vendors.they also made my stomach upset which is a sure sign of them serving old and unhygienic food since even the roadside momos have never done this to me.

i would definitely steer clear of this place, especially if you have ever had even half decent momos from anywhere else.  also this is the first time someone has given mayo with momos and i can confirm that the combination is as disgusting as it sounds.if you have poor taste in food or have a stomach made of iron, then sure, go ahead and order from this farce of a momo joint. otherwise learn from my mistake and let it be the only one to have occurred.",1,Very Negative
"all the hyderabadis out here, anybody who here who loves street food, obviously, dlf is out there for you ! but don't forget to look out for this shop. you would find steamed and fried momos, but it's very rare to find kurkure momos. have you even heard about those? wanna grap a taste ? go to dlf right away ! :)
it's mouth smacking.",4,Positive
one of the best places to have momos in and around gachibowli. located right opposite to dlf this place is over till late night. my favourite is the kurkure momo here. tastes very different from all the other momos. must try.,4,Positive
"paneer fried momo was yummy. thank you, the mayo and sauce was good. momos could be more softer, fried was too crispy. taste could also improve much more.",3,Neutral
"watching ipl and ordred norfest, thought of adding some appetizer to my meal...ordered kurkure momos vegetarian.

arrived nice and hot and on time

problem- the fried kurkure felt fried on stale oil, the coating was really thick tasted more of the oil coating than anything inside.

sauce was mayo and red sauce. i am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos? antways i tried the red sauce , thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil, sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it!

lessons- never order fried momos again ever! may try the steamed based on rating.",2,Negative

it may appear slightly expensive for momos. but they truly taste as amazing if not better than the best momos you had in a north eastern indian city. especially the steamed chicken momos with the masala spread and the super spicy chutney perfectly compliments it,5,Positive

i have been here and had it's momos. it was not that great! so i had ordered chicken steamed momos on zomato and was disheartened to find that the momos have degraded further in it's taste. the outer covering was dry and not well cooked. it tasted like it was not freshly made. the filling was not satisfying at all. moreover the salt was a bit over the top. the sauce served was excessively salty and tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chilli paste. not good at all. i had been in their shop quite e few times but this time it was really disappointing.,2,Negative
i've ordered several times from this place and their kurkure momos are simply awesome. they taste just how you get them in delhi. even the fried and steamed momos are good but can't beat kurkure momos!,4,Positive

"so on one of the weeknite i craved for momos.most of the delivery points were closed except this.so thot to give it a try.delivery was delayed and that made me lil upset.i ordered two things: veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos.

veg steamed momos:the packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil box.the filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my mood.the veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good either.the schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo.
chichen steamed momo:all of the above applies though the chicken smelled as if it was day old.

highly disappointing! 2stars just for the zomato valet!",2,Negative

"momos delight
the chicken kurkure momo's were a true delight and so were the chicken momo's which were sprinkled with some special masala. the only downer was the red momo chutney as it tasted like tomato sauce. i am sure if they can make authentic momos,then they can also make authentic momo's chutney.",4,Positive

its one of my favourite places to have momos. im addicted to this place... perfect steamed momos at affordable pricing. they have the fried momos n kurkure momos which are a must try too... happy dining yall !,5,Positive
"a small kiosk among the many eateries opposite the dlf building. a friend recommended this place as authentic delhi style momos, so stopped by.

at around 9pm, only steamed chicken momos (60/5) were available. they were absolutely steamy hot, soft and delicious. inside the thin momo skin, was a large filling of minced chicken meat, minimal veggies. just perfect.

momos were served with a nice spicy and tangy red chilly chutney, and a dollop of mayonnaise, that i left. somehow the combination of momos and mayo didn't work for me.

they have crusted 'kurkure' momos that weren't available, but hope to try them sometime later!

here's my overall score:
food - 5/5 (chicken filling! ‚≠ê)

a must visit place for all the chocolate lovers!!
this chain has been around for more than a decade now and they still keep me amused each time i visit.

i tried dark chocolate fondue. the dark chocolate was flavourful, thick and glossy. the dips were very well coherent with the chocolate and they are all 100% eggless!

potato wedges poutine was another dish that i loved the most and you should not miss this! it has white sauce pasta base with well seasoned potato wedges!

the pancakes were fulffy and are perfect when paired with hot chocolate!

food taste- not that great and specially at the price you would expect some quality or effort in it.

pizza had an uncooked base and the sauce they used on the base was normal sweet ketchup. a few bellpeppers on top and rest was normal cheese. not what you will expect after giving 250 bucks for it. same with spaghetti- came in a tiny box, no garlic bread, on the name of aglio olio- it was just couple of olives and olive oil and nothing else. no herbs/ seasoning or flakes.",2,Negative
"ordered the chocolate avalanche. the quantity is too much that easily 3 people can have it in dessert. hence, the price is not too costly if you keep the quantity in mind. it was a brownie and ice cream kinda mixture which was too chocolaty and perfect for the chocolate craving. the waffer became soggy in it and didn't taste good. they should start serving a smaller size too so that we can order for one person too at a lesser cost!",4,Positive

going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired, but the service is so appalling, probably you‚Äôll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive. the place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment. i‚Äôd recommend you do that cause anyway, they deliver orders after forever. üôà

as the name goes, i‚Äôve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar. and hence, i‚Äôve never tried the savoury items offered here. but i‚Äôve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos. so that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes. üôÇ

the toblerone shake and the kitkat shake are the shizzz. so full of the taste- actually well prepared. the chocolate brownie is really a waste of money: you‚Äôve probably had much better brownies all over hyderabad. üòù

superb place. went to fulfill some early morning cravings. easy to locate it as it's situated in the busy street of vinayak nagar gachibowli. ambiance is nice and calm they have separate kids play area and a party hall for celebrations. the place can easily accommodate 50 to 70 people. coming to food we ordered 1. garden fresh sandwich it was really loaded with some nice veggies and perfect amount of cheese and toasted to perfection 2. the veg cheese sandwich again it was yummy and had roasted mushrooms to go with onion and cheese. 3. oreo cookie shake - sweetness was just adequate and flavour was awesome as well though they can do something with the thickness of it as it was way watery for my liking. recommended ü§ò,5,Positive

"out of hunger and trust on the restaurant i ordered a chicken burger from american wild wings, gachibowli hoping it would be tasty and healthy but the kind of service i recieved was really pathetic. at first the restaurant took almost 40 mins to prepare just a small chicken burger, i tried calling restaurant about the update and they weren't even responsive, didn't answer any of my call. i kept my patience and waited for the order to arrive. aftr receiving the order what i saw was really a bad experience. the french fries that i used to get always were replaced by some oily, smelly, rotten potato pakodis. not just that i hoped my burger to be nice but it was again a big disappointment. the very first bite of it tasted really bad. chicken seemed fried to be in very bad oil and smelled filthy. i had to throw it after my first three bites. and then after sometime i even started having pain in my stomach . this particular experience of mine was very disappointing with american wild wings. i didn't think of myself to waste money, wait for an hour and still get suffer after eating that food",1,Very Negative
i've ordered from this place a couple of times and i loved the burger and fries. but last night the burger i got was undercooked and reeked of vegetable oil. it was completely inedible. writing this review to bring it to the management's notice so they can fix this and make sure it doesn't happen again.,3,Neutral

"so on my latest visit to this amazing american themed place, i had an amazing experience. we kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. there were desi and videshi khaana both.
we started off with the forte of this place ,wings. we had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. i personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. chicken was rightly done in every single dish. preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. the only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
there were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
.
coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ‚ù§Ô∏è
.
the fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. it was an instant favorite.
.
kuch desi khaana we had in there were gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. shocked? well hum bhi hue the. but lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è a must try.
.
.
some snacks we had in there were chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. the nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. üòç the popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

taste wise : 4.5/5
price: 5/5
ambience: 4/5
allover: 4.8/5 (a sure visit)",5,Positive
"*visit by invite*

located in a buzy spot, this joint has definitely some good food to offer.

we tried a host of items from the menu. starting off with chicken nuggets which were the show stopper. next up we had chicken wings, which to be honest didn't excite us too much apart from the barbeque chicken wings.

fried chicken burger had a tender and juicy patty served along some good french fries. chicken popcorn were a major disappointment and the raw material used didn't look fresh. chicken drumsticks gave nice visual as well as taste appeal. to keep the show running, we had caesar salad on the side which definetly requires a revamp and the joint can play with salad dressings, spices rather than having it served just with mayo.

in the end, we had biryani which gets served under the brand of fireblast biryani. this biryani has still a long way to go and in order to beat the best of biryani's in town need some more experiments with flavors.

while food here is decent, the ambiance requires immideat attention. the entrace was cluttered and the back of counter was clogged with unwanted items. a bit of touch up in both food and ambiance can turn this into a 5 star rating experience. #thewandererfoodies

"hello hyderabad..!!!!!my review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. and now i can safely say that it's one of the  awesome food court around hitech city and gachibowli. it is  located near the dlf signals and beside creamstone gachibowli above thick shakes. 
the ambiance is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a pdr section.

the menu design with array spans of continental, chinese and indian cuisines. here's the list of things that i have tried, across all my visits

red hot roasted chicken wings  ‚ù§Ô∏è - juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with mexican                                                                   jerk suces yummy unforgettable. 

crispy chilli corn kernels - the usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.

drum stick dum biryani-
omg very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it. 
drum sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - nachos topped with red sauce and i just  loved it.  
combos ‚ù§Ô∏è - the true fact i have ever seen even in kfc, mc-donald's such awesome combi within a convincing budget. loved it. 

i cannot stress enough on how i have loved all that i tried here. i have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far the variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. but what i really adore here is their mock-tails. sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight! also a fan of coke float.

the staff is ever so courteous. awesome place to hangout with friends it really fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!!!!!",5,Positive
"it's hard to find places which give delivery upto morning 4am. american wild wings is one of them. it's just beside creamstone, gachibowli. they deliver chicken wings,salad,popcorn,fries,biriyani and andhra style chicken from evening till morning . they have a decent seating arrangement too. for chicken wings, you got almost 10/12 sauces to choose upon. among them my favorite are texas bbq and mexican jerk. also tried their strawberry mocktail which was refreshing. their biriyani comes with drumsticks / wings. tried the drumstick biriyani. chicken were well spicy and well with curry leaves ( andhra style). service,ambience and prices all were decent. nothing fancy to be expected.
so if you are planning to have something beforig indulging urself in creamstone visit here.

"american wild wings is an affordable version of b-dubs. mainly focused on wings, fries and burgers with a touch of desi dishes as well.

i was there with my wife for dinner and we had a delightful time as we both love chicken wings. the various sauces on offer is amazing. we tried pattaya thai, texas bbq, mexican jerk, original hot and amazon wild. i liked bbq and original hot, both were exceptional. we then moved on to chicken nuggets, chicken fried burger and grilled chicken salad. nuggets were amazing, crispy and soft while burger and salad were delicious as well.

we had this with a few soft drinks and mocktails, namely lemonade and mango. both were pretty good but can be improved.

service was great. we were very well taken care by mr srinivas, the branch manager. ambience is okay and needs to be worked upon a bit being an upcoming fast-food joint.

overall, an excellent place for chicken wing lovers and that too at a moderate price range.",5,Positive
"i absolutely love chicken wings so i had to try this new place in gachibowli as i‚Äôve heard about it from a few friends.

i‚Äôve been to this place with a group of foodie friends.
this is a small outlet located on the first floor ,right above dirty burgers.
the place can host upto 30 pax max.
the place was bright and colourful with good lights all over the place.



food:
we tried different sauces:
the texas bbq ,spicy garlic ,pattaya thai ,original hot ,mexican jerk and amazon wild.
all of the wings were delicious and had varying spiciness.
the wings were slightly crispy outside and soft inside,just the way i like them to be.

next we were served with chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn.
the best munching dish i love till date are the chicken nuggets.
they tasted really good and were tastier than expected.
the nuggets were my favourite.

the chicken popcorn was not that great.
the presentation was not at all good and the chicken was very chewy.
need to improve this.

surprisingly the menu had biryani in it.
we tried their wings dim biryani .
the biryani was not that proper hyderabadi biryani but had a good taste .
they served a really good quantity of biryani.

the management has to improve in their food presentations.
i personally liked this place and recommend everyone to do give it a try.",4,Positive
"american wild wings = amazing wings
i happened to visit this place yesterday for dinner. well who doesn't like chicken wings? i love wings so wanted to check out this place.
it's a small cozy place, giving cafe feels. interiors are decent and so is the seating. there aren't any sections as the place is streched longitudinaly. they have self service system.
coming to food and menu,
the menu looks quite economical with respect to the portion size of the food and taste. so it is value for money. the only thing which needs improvement is the presentation of the dishes.
taste, quantity and price are all up to the mark.
i tried their signature sauces for the mains, texas bbq, pattaya thai, spicy garlic, original hot, mexican jerk and amazon wild. to my surprise all the wings were delicious specially the bbq and original hot, loved them.
tried out the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken... among which nuggets were really good but chicken popcorn needs some improvement.
the menu seems interesting as they also serve biryani, not the authentic one but related to their respective genre, like wings dum biryani and drumsticks dum biryani. the quantity of chicken in the biryani was heavy and it tasted good too. also had the chef special gongura chicken which was not on the menu. it was the star of the evening though, tatse, texture everything was perfect.
also had a ceaser salad which required more dressing and flavour. had fried chicken burger too, which was tasty and ya tastier than the kfc burger.
overall the place is affordable and nice. the hospitality was very nice. thanks mr. srinivas, you were always up your feet and served us well. the staff is humble and friendly.
recommended!!",4,Positive

"american wild wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings. located in gachibowli main road, just beside creamstone, it is a place to relish chicken wings.

i tried out their chicken nuggets, chicken salad, chicken fried burger and various chicken wings. the sauce i loved the most was bbq chicken wings. chicken nuggets were amazing as well.

we tried their lemonade and mango mojito, they were okay but can be improved. the service by mr srinivas is quick and he is very understanding. ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance.

this place is a must try for their wings and nuggets.",5,Positive
"rating - 3.5

visited this place on a friday evening. the interiors are okayish, they need to work alot upon that.

now coming to food:

we tried their wings in 8-9 different sauces. most of them were really good and the chicken was fresh and meat fell off the bone.

my personal favorite was mexican jerk, barbeque and konaseema. though the sauces can be reduced a little.

also the lemon garlic and original hot need to be improved. the lemon garlic had so much oil in it and the original hot tasted nothing but red chilli powder.

we also ordered virgin mojito which was very very sweet for our palate.

the chicken caesar salad was a big disappointment as it was full of lettuce and sauces. the chicken was very chewy.

we also ordered chicken biryani and patiala chicken.

the biryani was good but had a lot of oil in it. meat was fresh and tender.

patiala chicken had good flavors but alot of masala in it.

also the chicken popcorn can be completely avoided as the chicken is very rubbery and needs alot of improvement.

the white sauce pasta again was very sweet for our liking.

overall this place needs alot of improvement but you can definitely try out their wings as they are good and economically priced.",4,Positive
"american wild wings is another fast food joint located amidst the cream stone outlet of gachibowli. the place is open and has an ideal sitting space for 20-30 people. went there with my friends to try out their food. i found their ambiance quite ordinary and i felt it can get some makeover.

starting with their appetizers, we first tried out their in house chicken wings. so, the chicken wings served over here are classified into various types. they offer a wide range of sauces for their wings ranging from classic texas bbq, pattaya thai, spicy garlic, amazon wild etc.

my personal favorite of the lot had to be original hot chicken wings and mexican wild chicken wings. the wings were super juicy and delicious. however, i also feel that the sauce content was too much for the wings which can be slightly reduced in order to make it taste perfect.

next up, we had their classic chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken. the nuggets were super tasty and very much similar to what we usually get to eat at all fast food outlets. the popcorn chicken was chewy. it requires serious attention and changes.

for mains, the place has also introduced authentic indian dishes such as chicken biryani with salan, raita and gongura chicken. the gongura chicken was an absolute relish. to my surprise, the meat fell of the bone quite nicely and it worked really nicely with the clean flavors of the biryani.

thanks for a wonderful time mr. srinivas. moreover, this place is comparatively quite pocket friendly and can be given a shot for their chicken wings anyday. happy eating, :)",4,Positive
"they say ""count your chicken before they hatch"" and this weekend i did almost that. hehehe, well, we were counting them before having it üòÜüçóüòâ.

our visit was an invite for a complimentary lunch by mr. srinivas lanka incharge of the restaurant operations, management and marketing. this place on a main location of gachibowli, hyderabad with a dine-in. they offer american cuisine for üêîüêìüçó chicken lovers and as the name suggests they specialise in chicken wings.

we got some thirst-quenching mojito mocktails- lemonade, orange and strawberry. they also offer slushies but was not available at that time. moving on as suggested we ordered the wings with 4 kinds of sauces- pattaya thai, spicy garlic, texas bbq and mexican jerk (üëà this one was my favourite). they were slightly crispy on outside and juicy on the inside.

pattaya thai- spicy sauce with coarse texture
spicy garlic- finely chopped garlic and chilli flakes sauce
texas bbq- the same old barbecue sauce with sweet and savoury taste and a hit of chilli. 
mexican jerk- a sweet and spicy smooth textured sauce that won my üíì.  

we also ordered for popcorn chicken which was crispy fried but not very impressive, original patty burger which was quite simple (no veggies in it, not even the basic ones like- tomato, onion rings or lettuce) and was served pretty hot with french fries so be careful when you take a bite. we also ordered for asian (fried) chicken salad but was served with caesar chicken salad ü•ó, which was little disappointing to taste as well.

you can definitely visit this place on fridays and saturdays for drinks (liquor) as well. so here is my rating on this-  

food- 4/5 (this is just for the chicken wings alone)
service- 3.5/5 (little slow but courteous staff)
ambience- 3/5 (nice and decent)

overall i would like to rate it 3.8/5 as there is lot of scope for improvement in future.

"we happened to visit american wild wings on a friday evening and the place was desolated. the place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

we started with a lemon mojito. though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. we thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our chicken ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. it almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. we tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. all the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. must try sauces! while these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. the lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. the original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. they also have a sauce names atomic - the hottest on their menu. it was indeed very hot for my liking. we also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. chicken nuggets were good. nothing out of the ordinary.

though their usp is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. we tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. the meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. chicken punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. it had the perfect saag flavor. again, too oily.

upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. the pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. stay away!

another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. the first serving of our wings was dead cold. when brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. the biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. the bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. the quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. they also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

"i was invited by mr. srinivas, the man in charge at aww for a tasting lunch session, the food was complimentary from their side. i had a nice afternoon there. the restaurant is very well placed in gachibowli, just near karachi bakery on old mumbai highway.

the best part of the experience (beside the wonderful time spent with mr. srinivas) was the food. i tasted their chicken nuggets, caesar salad, different types of chicken wings and i took a parcel of grilled chicken burger with fries.
- i really encourage everyone to try their wings! i had texas bbq sauce, parmesan and garlic, mexican and lemon pepper sauce. i thoroughly enjoyed every style. the wings were juicy and tender, yammm.
- caesar salad was very nicely dressed, nice chunks of chicken there and the croutons made the dish complete.
- the burger was definitely above the average burgers you have in the city. the burger patty was a real burger patty not some sweet bun.
- nuggets were regular, deep fried with mayo, nothing special here, just a decent starter.
more of that, i checked their menu and the prices are really reasonable!

aside the good food, there is some room for improvement. the place should be better maintained. at the entrance door there was a bit of mess and the cleanliness is not their strongest point. the order and cash counter side looks more like a storage area with boxes and bags over there. the tables, floors and windows should be spotless because this restaurant really has potential! and also i would suggest to have a better quality cutlery because the plastic fork given was horrible, it bended every each time i tried to pick some food. if they will focus a bit more on maintenance and details it can be a busy place because definitely the food is good.

overall a reasonable priced restaurant with good food and some room for improvement in the ambiance area. but definitely recommended for a least a try!

"it is very rare that the food is so horrible that you have to leave it mid-way and post a review. 

i ordered chicken burger + fries + wings + soft drink combo through zomato, and received my order fairly quickly. however,
(1) fries were totally cold and soggy. 
(2) burger was average - tasted like the low-end 40 rupees burger at mcdonalds.
(3) wings were either burnt or double-fried. there were parts of the thick coating which were burnt black - and they perhaps tried to fix it by adding too much sauce on the top.

looking at other reviews it feels like it might be once-in-a-while exception but they ruined my monday lunch!

wouldn't recommend.",1,Very Negative
"would rate this place 3.5
the food is good no doubt but they are not professional with the quantity. i have ordered ceasar salad twice. once, the quantity was decent, but the next time it was very less. please take note before ordering. food is good though.",3,Neutral

"i ordered the signature chicken wings through zomato, which is 1xfrench fries, 6x chicken wings, and one coke(350ml).
quantity was satisfactory.
packaging of the food was good. i really liked how they packaged the coke, which was still a bit cold when it arrived. some may call it excessive packaging however.
the fries were warm and well salted. but they were not crispy. this could be the fault of delivery, so i am not upset. only 1 restaurant in zomato has so far managed to deliver crispy fries consistently.
the wings were covered in brown gravy. i was expecting crispy wings like in the photograph. while the wings were certainly not bad, i did not enjoy it very much.
i would recommend you order from the restaurant and try it out once yourself.",4,Positive

"i have ordered from dominos all my life, but no store has ever been this bad.
the order arrived in 45 mins, all my food had completely cooled down.
i asked the delivery boy about their 30 mins policy, and he gave a very casual answer saying ""ma'am parking me late hogya, jaane do"" i tried to argue saying that its not my problem and he agreed to give me a 300 rs refund. i asked him to do it at the moment and he said, his manager is busy so it cant be done right now but he assured me that it will be done. 

i talked to his manager on the phone, and he completely denied my refund. 
he didn't care about customer service, he talked very rudely, and he said he's not going to follow the policy. he also said i don't care if you accept the order or return it.
(if this was the case, why did the delivery boy ensure my refund and tried to run off?)

people like this don't deserve to be a part of dominos.
they're completely ruining the franchise image.",1,Very Negative
pathetic service . food arrived in 2 hours cold and no apology from the restaurant . very bad customer care service from zomato and dominoes.,1,Very Negative
worst experience at dominos. no air conditioner at the store is working (out of 5). it was too hot. no one cared about it. it took too long to get the tables cleaned.,1,Very Negative
i ordered pizza with extra cheese but there is no extra cheese in it. i cant imagine dominos can do such a pathetic job. i am totally dissatisfied,1,Very Negative
"domino's doesn't live up to the standards any more. i ordered a pizza and it was late with a delivery time of 1hour with a promised delivery of 30 mins. once i got the pizza it was smashed.. when asked for a refund they said they will give me ""domino's"" credits. however i didn't get the credits as well. also i don't want domino's credits. i want my money back. i will never order from dominos again and would advise that they shut down at least this store since they are not able to live up to the standards.
attached images of the smashed pizza.",1,Very Negative

"pathetic experience
never order from this outlet
they neither deliver the order nor refund your money
i ordered at around 9pm from this outlet and waited till 11 i never received my food
also all the help line numbers they provide are either wrong or not reachable
highly disappointed",1,Very Negative
garlic bread was half cooked,2,Negative
"ordered a pizza, garlic bread and other stuff on 14th feb at 9 pm through zomato. zomato shows order is in the kitchen. but no call, no delivery even by 10.15 pm. the branch number on zomato was incorrect. called up dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. waited for 15 min. no call back. called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.

i anyway don't eat dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. but ordered on my wife's insistence. congratulations. now even my wife doesn't want to order dominos ever again. :)

1. zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. the system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.

2. dominos hotline is worthless. no clue on if their branch actually has a working phone or not.",1,Very Negative
all time favourite. my favourite is pepper barbecue and stuffed garlic bread. high quality with reasonable prices .no other pizza can dominate domino's pizza,5,Positive

"the pizzas were delivered to me after 2 hours of placing the order and they were cold. inspite of raising a complain 3-4 times, i did not receive any customer support and wasn't even contacted by their supervisor. needless to say, i wasn't even reimbursed for the late delivery and cold pizzas.",1,Very Negative
"i had been waiting 1 hour 26 min to receive my order and i didn't get any information from zomato as well as dominos, the contact numbers that mentioned in the message didn't work at all. finally i got a call from delivery guy after 1 hour and he said will be there in 3 min. but still waited 26 min infront of my gate to see the delivery guy. the worst thing was i couldn't eat that pizza since it was harder than the packing box",1,Very Negative

"i ordered chicken hakka, they gave us chicken chowmein absolutely white, blant and tasteless. i complained to the waiter who said thats the way they make it, yet he offered to replace with chicken schezwan noodles which i declined, as i wasn't sure to further ruin my taste n appetite. cocktails were decent, non-veg platter was ok ok, couldn't differentiate between the taste in tikkas. i am grading down to 2 stars only because of the amateur chowmein served in the name of hakka.",2,Negative

service is very very slow even on a weekday. it took so much time for kababs to come.

often they say, if you arrive late, make it grand. we hoped the food will be awesome as they might took so much time to prepare it. but alas! the food is disgusting!

not recommended at all. go only if you're getting offer like more than 60% off.. otherwise complete waste of money!",1,Very Negative
"today went to this place. i will be brutality true.. there's a reason why they are giving huge discounts via different booking/table reservation platforms.

service : very very slow even on a weekday. seems kitchen is highly understaffed.

food: pathetic! i am living in hyderabad for last 10 years. i haven't had so pathetic kababs here in hyderabad, like what i got at arena eleven.

overall a big no. please don't waste your money here.

1. ordered fish lemon pepper kabab.. it was too salty.

2. ordered chicken tikka kabab. you can't even chew the chickn pieces, it was so hard & tasteless.

3. ordered a mocktail for my wife, it was full of water instead!!",1,Very Negative

"arena eleven sports bar

ipl is here and whats better way to enjoy it than watching it in a sports bar! there aren't many sports bar around and arena eleven is the swankiest ones in town. located in the snl terminal , this is the best destination if you are a sports fan.

ambience (4/5): the seating space is quite big with multiple screens with sports channels playing on every wall and corner. they have a nice wooden furniture which also adds to the asthetics of the place. beautifully designed restro, arena eleven has all glass walls and is perfect to have a city view while munching on your food. they have some good tracks playing which i liked as well.they have indoor as well as outdoor seating.outdoor seating us just opposite to landscape of trees and was bliss to enjoy it as the rain drops poured down the city.

food and beverages ( 4/5) :

you can opt for either ala carte or buffet.the place has both options.

mocktails and cocktails : in mocktails we had non alcoholic sangria which was the best drink amonst all we tried. this had grape juice , with fresh apple and bartenders mix. then we tried mint julep which was fresh otange wedges with mint,lime and orange juice. it was decent.zen zero was the one we tried next which had lemon chunks ,brown sugar ,ginger and fresh mint topped with cola. it was nothing special and was too sweet.virgin mojito was as it should be.

in cocktails we tried old fashioned which had bourbon with sugar and bitters. this one was a little too concentrated and strong for me.next we had kentucky apple cinnamon which had burbon whiskey infused with apple juice and cinnamon. it was a delightfull drink.then was the cucumber cooler which had gin infused with cucumber and sour mix. this drink did not appeal to my taste as was too much of cucumber taste.

food:

1. veg manchaow soup : the soup did not appeal my pallate . it was moreovee tasting like rasam than a chinese soup.

2. tandoor items : we had some tandoori chicken legs and some chicken tikkas which were really well prepared and chicken quality was also good.

3. tandoori non veg sizzler : this was a surprise which sizzling mixed tendoori items like chicken tikka , fish tikka .it was absolutely delighfull.

4.tandoori veg sizzler : this had paneer tikka,veg seekh kabab.the veg seekh kabab was dry and lacked in flavour.

5. hot wings : the hot wings were sweet to taste where as ,as the name itself suggests it should be hot and spicy. this was a disappointing one

6.tandoori chicken tandri : tandoori chicken tandri was tender and juicy and masalas were nicely amalgamated with the chicken peices.

7. masala fries : this is a very new concept which i tried for the first time. the masala fries were served with chopped onions.it was really good and we couldn't stop at one or two.

8.chilli fish : chilli fish was a nicely tossed fish in oriental style.

8. chicken tikka pizza : chicken tikka pizza was absolutely scrumptious toppings. this was a thin crust pizza with indianised way of toppings and pizza sauce. the crust though was too hard and felt as if not freshly baked.

9. chicken seekh kabab : i absolutely loved the seekh kababs which had a nice flavours of soices coming through.

10. veg seekh kabab : the veg seekh kqbabs felt dry and lacked flavours.could be better.

11. chicken green curry and steamed rice : the chicken green curry was absolutely divine to eyes. the consistency was also creamy. the taste though was slightly to the sweeter side which dint give the balanced flavour.

12. chicken tikka biryani ( from the buffet) : absolutely yummy this biryani was the one eveeyone has there eyes on from the veey beginning. the hot steaming biryani was spicy and the lipsmacking tikkas along gave a nice taste overall.

desserts

1. gajar ka halwa : i absolutely loved the gajar ka halwa. warm halwa just melted in the mouth and with the icecream along ,it felt divine.

2. kheer : the kheer was also nice and gave a cery homely taste.

the place is really nominal with good food. with this rate charged and the sports add on it provides,this place is absolutely recommended.",4,Positive

coming to the food ordered chicken nasheman tikka, stuffed tangdi kebab and fish tikka for starters. all tasted good. tried pina colada mocktail which was fine but don't go with spicy food.for maindish we were suggested to take sizzling chicken tikka biryani and was tatsy as suggested.
ambaince was good with outdoor and indoor seating.

"arena eleven, an sports bar with the theme menu of kebabs and beer with live screening of sports every day. located in the sln terminus mall in level 3, cozy ambience well set up of giant screens and led screens all over the restaurant as you cannot miss any single action of your sorts while eating the delicious kebabs and sizzlers. a pocket friendly restaurant with awesome food menu.

i have been there on multiple times once with a friend and also by a invite. both of my experiences are much better then the before one.

my favorites at arena eleven are the kebab sizzling platters, the assorted sizzling platters are so succulent and tasty with the hot sizzle.

i love the chicken pizza the thin crust and the toppings are really good.

thai green curry with steam rice are one of my favorite, but just they need to be little consistent.

chicken tikka biryani is the usp of arena eleven menu, it's really too good in taste and the quality.

i had the best non alcoholic sangria here. it was the best so far, must try this.

arena eleven has very good and economical lunch buffet, the spread is much worth at price of rs: 550/-

rice kheer is my favorite in desserts.",5,Positive
"visited arena 11 for a sunday branch. it was easter sunday and the place was packed. also, since the ipl season is on, this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list.

the have sunday buffet brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious. though the presentation can be improved alot.

we also tasted their ala carte menu, a few of the items were good but their isn't much consistency with their dishes.

at once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par.

lemon pepper fish tikka, honey chilli chicken wings and tangri kebab were served.

the lemon fish tikka and tangdi kebab were good but honey chilli chicken wings were too sweet for my palate.

the sizzling veg tikka platter and masala fries were good.

in buffet, the chicken curry and murg makhani stood out.

also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great.

i suggest them to add some more variety for desserts",3,Neutral
"arena eleven is a sports bar ,located at the plush and financial province of hitec city .there is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. the menu is extensive. there is plenty of waitstaff. our waitress frequently stopped by to make sure we were satisfied, and refilled soda and water drinks without being requested to.
we say outside seating gives you are brief view of the surrounding areas and the view is simply beautiful playing. the music selections were good, but not too loud.
the portions were very generous. .
there are many tv screens for sports viewing indoor, and even a few outdoor.
an overall good atmosphere..they have a buffet and alacarte kind of system here ..upon ourvisit here we tried their buffet and ordered few delicacies from their alacarte menu as well ..the food the drinks everything was on point .one can surely enjoy this place at any time of the day .as this place is a sports bar as such the reservation is recommended during any sport featurings .do head to this place if you are a sports buff and if yournt one as you will have a great time at this place

what to say...one of the worst restaurant in town. real slow service. no management. no proper place to sit. worst of all poor customer service. i was a regular visitor bt now the treatment i got makes me not to go again. i also had a corporate party scheduled yesterday trusting there service. but after taking money they didn't provide a table. my team stood there for almost 50mins. later we were forced to walk out. they did refund the money bt had to go through alot before getting it back. guys there are lot of good places for watching ipl. this is a shit place...u will end up destroying ur day. pls refrain from going to this place.,1,Very Negative
"it's during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town. but not to worry as arena eleven's here to woo the same crowd, with their delightful sports-themed decor offering big-screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience. located at level 4 of sln terminus mall in gachibowli, the tagline for the place is ""kebabs, beers & sports"" each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly.

the menu for the place is particularly compact, serving only a selective few indian and oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets. sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a'la carte section, we ended up calling for their sizzling veg tikka platter and masala fries both of which turned out to be pretty good. the platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice, namely veg shami, peri peri and lemon pepper paneer tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base. veg shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture. masala fries was just a indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions, ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks.

non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the tangri kebab, lemon pepper fish tikka and honey chili chicken wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind. my personal favourite was their lemon pepper fish however, for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination. honey chili wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce, probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers. disappointing was their chili fish however which had no flavour whatsoever - bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning. the kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper.

running a buffet on weekends, the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of indian options to choose from. each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice, where the non vegetarian sect had chicken curry and murg makhani along with some delectable chicken tikka biryani. after the disappointment in the starters, it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were. chicken curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added, going absolutely well with some hot tandoori rotis. same was the case with murg makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste. trying out their chicken tikka pizza from the a'la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale, which definitely didn't justify the price tag for the same. the dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the gajar ka halwa and rice kheer both of which were plain simple average.

the service too wasn't any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help. getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task, however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well. the kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace, they almost always lacked consistency. the dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called, brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate. all in all, if the place provides a run-of-the-mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely.

"arena eleven, nestled in sln terminus, gachibowli, is a sports-themed bar and restaurant with live screenings all around. with two large screens and three televisions, no matter where your table is, you will be able to catch all the sporting action. during the day, the clarity of the large screens is lower, because of the bright light from the glass panes. the best part of the outdoor seating section is that it is located just beside the botanical garden with a sumptuous view of the green cover. perfect to enjoy the cool breeze, watch a match and hang out with friends. 
 the bar menu offers an extensive range of classic cocktails with a good variety of imported spirits and liqueur. they serve a widespread buffet with an array of mains. the starters will be served to the table.
in the starters, we tried the sizzling tikka platter which consists of chicken tandoori, lemon pepper chicken, tangdi chicken, paneer tikka, veg seekh kabab and fish tikka. tangdi chicken made a perfect starter, soft and succulent chicken legs coated with a host of spices and grilled to perfection. fish tikka was melting in the mouth with good flavors. in veg, don't miss out in paneer tikka. it was so soft and properly cooked with the right amount of spices infused. veg seekh kebab was good when we had it for the first time. but when ordered for the next time, it was very dry.
apart from the tikka platter, we tried chicken 65, honey chili wings, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish and masala fries. i loved all of them.

in the main course, from the buffet, they have two non-veg curries and two veg curries and assorted bread. curries tasted delightful with rich gravy and spices on point. ordered and tried their thai veg curry, which disappointed me, as it was too sweet. chicken tikka biryani is a hit, it was as tasty as it looks. it was very different from the regular hyderabadi biryani yet very delicious. 
tried the butter chicken masala pizza. though the toppings were great, the pre-baked base which they used dropped the taste.

from desserts, they have gajar halwa and rice kheer. tasted ok-ish , not so great.

drinks need some improvements, as some are very sweet.

if improved on the glitches in the food and drinks, its a great place to eat, drink, socialize and watch your favourite sports live.",4,Positive
"rating: 3.5

replacing serafina, arena eleven is a new addition to the sln terminus mall. with tv screens playing different kinds of sports and walls adorned with sports memorabilia, the place is a crowd-puller during this ipl season. the place is well lit and has a long deck that gives you a beautiful view of the botanical garden.

our sunday lunch started with a few drinks. mint julep, virgin mojito, virgin sangria, virgin pina colada, zen zero - a mojito like drink with cola, calvados - their version of a hot toddy, old fashioned and kentucky apple cinnamon. though the cocktails were potent, they lacked finesse. mocktails in most cases were either too sweet or watered down. the better ones of the lot were calvados, apple cinnamon and mint julep.

in the starters, we tried their sizzling tikka platter that had an assortment of regular chicken, lemon pepper, malai, nasheman, paneer and fish tikkas. the stand out ones here were the fish and lemon pepper tikkas. we also tried their tangdi kebab, salt and pepper prawns, chili fish, salt and pepper wings, chicken 65, honey chili wings, chicken lollipop in hot garlic sauce, masala fries, chicken and veg sheek kebabs. one thing we noticed in these starters was the lack of consistency. our first round of the veg sheek kebab was amazing which led us to order more. the second round was super disappointing as the kebab was dry and tasteless. the tangdi kebab was well made. soft and juicy chicken marinated well and cooked to perfection in a tandoor. the chili fish and fish tikka too were super delicious!

i visited this place twice. during the first visit, i tried the chicken peri peri tikka roll, chicken rajiala, onion kulcha and thai green chicken curry for mains. the roll was passable. we were told that the chicken rajiala was a star on their menu but it didn't really prove to be. it tasted like a regular buffet green chicken curry. nothing special. the thai green chicken curry blew us off with it's flavors. each of the flavors in the dish could be tasted individually but when they came together, it was magic! pairing it with some hot steamed rice elevated it further and left of licking our spoons! during the second visit, we chose to eat the mains from their sunday buffet and it was not a great decision. except a few dishes like the chicken curry and chicken tikka biryani, the rest were tasteless. we also ordered a chicken butter masala pizza that had a pre-made base and tasted substandard. we ordered a portion of the green curry again which utterly disappointed us by being too sweet.

they only had a couple of desserts in both instances - gajar halwa and rice kheer. they were just run-of-the-mill kind and didn't have any oomph factor.

overall, one thing that the place needs is consistency. their tag reads kebabs. beer. sports but the kebabs part isn't really justified. service is decent. they need quite a few improvements to keep up with the pace. they have some really pocket friendly happy hours and the place is awesome during sunset!

"arena eleven is a relatively new addition to the concept of sports bar in the city. located inside the sln terminus, it attracts a relatively young crowd living in the nearby it hubs.

i went over there to try out their weekend buffet. first things first, their buffet layout was well spread. the starters were served on the table accompanied by an array of curries and rice dishes to choose from. the drinks offered by them included mojito, zen zero and mint julep. the drinks were average and needs quite improvement.

speaking about their starters, i had their chicken tangdi, malai paneer tikka, salt and pepper prawns, lemon pepper chicken tikka, mutton seekh kebab and veg seekh kebab.

amongst all the starters, i loved their chicken tangdi kebab. the chicken was super juicy and was cooked to perfection. the use of proper marination was quite evident in the taste of the meat. next up, i also liked their lemon pepper chicken tikka. it had a subtle flavor of lemon all thanks to the dominating flavor of the pepper.

for mains, the spread comprised of two chicken main course dishes, two veg main course dishes accompanied by dal, assorted breads, biryani and salads. the chicken dishes were chicken curry and chicken tikka masala. i found both the curries simply wonderful just because of the fact that they were tasting much like home cooked chicken. for veg, their was mutter paneer and paneer butter masala. i liked their mutter paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.

their biryani was a slight disappointment for me. it could have been much more flavorful and the use of boneless chicken didn't really serve justice to the dish. apart from this, i also had my hands on their veg thai curry. it was served with steamed rice. to be honest, the preparation of thai green curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version. maybe, they can work upon the use of cocunut cream in the curry.

for desserts, i had their gajar ka halwa, kheer and ice cream. the desserts were pretty much ordinary and needs ample improvement all together.

all in all, the place has got a huge potential. all they need to do is to work upon slight glitches in their drinks and few main course items. happy eating. :)",4,Positive
"it looks like a sports bar with proper setup. but the people around did not seem to be sportive, especially on a friday night :p. service was a bit on the slower side. ambiance was good. now coming to the main part, the food.

sizzling non-veg tikka platter with 3 tikkas of your choice.
jamaica chicken tikka - the best of the lot and a must try.
nasheman chicken tikka - not so appealing but ok ok types taste.
malai fish tikka - soft and tasty
bhuna chicken - one of the best i have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious, so this is a must try
chicken rajiala - a green gravy with boneless chicken, not so tasty
chicken hakka noodles - it was too good especially for chinese lovers
sizzling chicken tikka biryani - look wise it was actually sizzling, but not so much taste wise. chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked.
ginger coke - please do not try this one, as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink

other than beer, i‚Äôve tried their lit and a classic martini!

i‚Äôve tried their sizzling non veg tikka platter where you get to choose 3 varieties from their whole kebabs menu!
as per the guy who served us, jamaican and nasheman was their speciality.
so we ordered that platter with jamaican, nasheman and malai fish tikka.
jamaican: 4/5 (more of a spicy tandoor)
nasheman:3/5 (lame and tasteless)
malai fish:4/5 (loves the soft malai fish)

i tried some fish item, i forget the name of the dish ..its finger licking dish. and tangidi biryani was taste less, no salt, no masala, may cheif might forgotten to add all these.
ipl or pl or uefa in arena...you love it with crowd",5,Positive
food and service needs to be improved. chinese starters are fine. pizza crust was very hard. mocktails were not good. iced tea had a very strong flavour of tea.,3,Neutral
"good food.
service poor.
tried sizzler kabab platter, veg pizza, gobhi manchurian and hakka noodles - all tasted good!
ambience - average to good.",4,Positive
visited for a lunch buffet with my office colleagues. i have booked table using dineout where i got 50% off (300/-) on lunch buffet which was definitely a great deal. we were 14 members altogether. we were served welcome drinks and followed by starters. which was nicely cooked. then we approached towards main course. although i didn't try much because i was already full with starters. i tried their desert which was nice. overall a nice place for dining out. but i think this place should be visited at night while watching football match or some ipl match with beers and kebabs. great place to hangout.,4,Positive
"i visited yesterday with my friend for lunch as we both were starving very badly...we choose buffet.it started with the chicken sweet corn soup and the starters were so yummy especially the chicken 65 and the honey baby corn that were a grade dishes.the chickn biryani was a good option for the main course.ambiance was really pleasent and also a hangout with friends especially during cricket matches as it does have live screens all over the place!

"ended up this place just before holi and it was a dry day, hardly 2 tables were occupied. starters were really good specially chicken tikka periperi and main course was good but too oily, biryani disappointed us as there is no masala flavor just topped with paneer tikka pieces. over all it was just okay they need to improve on service also as i did not find staff so friendly.

"i visited this place with my wife on 16 march,2019.  its located in sln terminus. we were looking for a place to dine after our movie at platinum, and we decided to give this place a try. was it worth it, lets find out.

ambiance
============
we entered this place around 10 pm on a saturday night and this place was  literally bustling with crowd. they have several television screens set up at various nook and corners of the lounge, and all of them played sports channel, ranging from cricket to premier league football. we were promptly seated at the verandah. the view from there is quite something. we got seated in a semi lit corner. the place has a cozy feeling and good vibes. liked it. ratings - 4/5.

service
============
pathetic. needs a lot of improvement. they took some time to produce the menu, and then the waiter just didn't show up for the order, for next 15 minutes at-least. we ordered food and drinks. the food was delayed and drinks just did't come. we had to repeatedly ask the waiter to serve the drinks at-least, so that we can end our boredom. luckily the food came soon after the drinks were served. when asked for the bill, they showed a mobile shot of the bill amount taken by the cashier, saying printer was faulty. phew! ratings - 1/5.

food
============
did food proved to be the savior for the night? read on.  we ordered a cranberry breezer, virgin mojito and couple of pinacoladas(yes, we took advantage of gold membership). the virgin mojito was pathetic. period.  the pinacoladas were really good. we ordered for sizzling veg tikka platter, which was strictly okay.  well the service and food really disappointed. ratings - 3/5.

value for money
=============
we shelled out 1200 bucks for food and drinks, that too have taken the gold membership advantage. high pricing along with lousy service and strictly average food never go hand in hand. so no way its vfm. ratings - 1.5/5.

let's calculate,

rating = (ambiance + service + food + vfm)/4 = 2.375

final thoughts
=============
this place has all the potential to be nice a sports bar, and i feel that their service and food really needs improvement!",2,Negative
"experience at arena eleven... since it‚Äôs in sln terminus mall it‚Äôs not very difficult to find. it was a friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. one big minus point is that on a friday evening the washroom was out of order and i had to cross all sln third floor to get to the toilet. ups, that‚Äôs really bad!

ambiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! usually i don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. they have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. there is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.

service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. they also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). on a friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!

when it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. we had sizzling kebab platter. chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. awesome kebabs!! really juicy and tasty every each one of them. we had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. they didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but i asked for some raitha and they brought. rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. the let down were the rolls. we had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. maximum average on quality and taste.
the price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!

"one of the worst experience i had. staff is not trained well and manager on-site is not at all worried for customer experience. even though i booked a table, i was not provided one. service guys are not bothered to ask if customer needs anything even if restaurant was not full. one of my ordered food was not even provided and what was provided that was stale and when asked manager was very rude with his replies. i left the restaurant in the middle as except bira beer everything was pathetic even in last management guy declined to provide me the bill and was very very rude, waited for around 15 minutes after paying the amount just to get the bill. avishek and ajit were the two guys handling the overall management the day i went. hope you guys have improved now and not giving same experience to others.",1,Very Negative
best place. nice ambiance. staff so humble specially abhisek and nice. best place to hang out with at the week end. must visit. lots of verifies in cocktails.....,5,Positive
"went for lunch buffet.
ambience was good with very nice choice of music. night view would be very nice.
choice of starters was limited but the taste was good. chicken kebab with a tinge of lemon was the best. however fish was undercooked.
surprisingly main course was quiet tasty with chicken tikka masala being the best.
on the dessert side, kheer was a spot on.
at the end i would like to tell the worst part of my experience which was the service. an utter dissapointment.
the waiter's arguing behaviour and careless service ruined my mood. i would ask the owner to please teach some basic behaviour to this waiter. i dont know his name but i think he is just ruining his fellowmates career as well.
because the food n ambience was good, overall i would rate this 4.2/5.",4,Positive
"paneer kebab was yummy
tofu curry was ok
naans were lip smacking

ambiance was good ,can rate 8/10
service was too late ,i rate 5/10",4,Positive
"was quite skeptical about arena eleven, the place being a newbie.
chose this over some top restaurants at sln terminus and i must say i wasn't disappointed.

the buffet has a simple menu with nearly 20 items. food tasted decent but the desserts should be improved by miles as they create final impressions in any buffet.

ambiance is quite good with indoor and outdoor seating, the place was fully packed on a weekday afternoon.
it has 2 screens and 5 tvs for sports viewing üëç

service could've been better, the staff seemed quite confused and unresponsive sometimes.

*the buffet offers great value only if you use the offers on dineout*

overall:
food:3.75/5
ambiance:4.5/5
service:2.5/5
value for money:4/5",4,Positive
overall a good place for hanging out during cricket and football matches cause of the ambiance. the food is good as well. we had the kebab platter which was delicious. the masala french fries were hot and crispy. the egg noodles were a good option for the main course. the chicken tikka biryani was disappointing though. the air conditioner was not open at 4 30 in the afternoon which made it a humid experience.,3,Neutral
"visited here during dine out offer period.

ambiance: the ambiance here is nice and pleasant. the restaurant is a sports themed restaurant with live screenings of match. there is an outside sitting area as well with the pleasant view of the botanical gardens. t

food: 

ü•£soup: chicken hot and spicy soup: i have to admit that this is one the items that i loved the most of this place. there is no shortage of chicken pieces in the soup unlike other outlets and the soup is also a perfect combination of spiciness and sourness.

starters: honey baby corn, chicken tikka, paneer fry, fish.

"so, it's our first time in hyderabad and we thought of having a great meal at radisson! we visited cascade and much to our disappointment we found the food not even close to being great! the vegetarian spread was very less with just 4 starters and that too of similar type! non vegetarian variety was better than vegetarian but was also not up to the mark. thought of making peace with the situation by hoping that the desserts would at least be nice, but they too weren't nice.
one of the worst experiences of all times!
to top it all, the air conditioner was not working ! definitely not going to visit again.",1,Very Negative
"went there for dinner in the weekend and had a very good experience. their focus on customer service is highly commendable. they made sure we were comfortably seated and also made separate seating arrangement for our 1 year old child.

on the fourth day, i noticed that ""naan"" wasn't available at the counter but when i enquired it, they immediately arranged it at my seat promptly. 

chef tarunima was checking with all the customers and educating them on the availability of live counters.

very tasty food we had so far. staff caring is good. hospitality is very good. me. salim and naresh taken good care through out our dinner time.,5,Positive
"sunday brunch experience at cascade-radisson. it was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated, i‚Äôll describe in the review.

service was really good, one of the best. mr. salim and staff really did a great job to host us. plus point for them!

ambiance instead was a total let down, at least for us. floor was dirty (as you can see in some pics), chairs were dirty, even the water bottle was dirty. the restaurant itself has nothing special, no atmosphere... just bland. if you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a no no!

food was on the good side. it had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou. starters were average as desserts. the best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles. all other items are usually like everywhere, salad counter, pizza and pasta counter etc. with some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste.

when it comes to the price for the buffet i think is too expensive. most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it!

as for the restaurant staff... i have to say that pranika was very very polite and she gave me a good feeling. anything i wanted she helped me with it. i can say that by far she made me feel at home. the only thing that was a little bit frustrating....was the fact that the wifi wasn‚Äôt working properly everywhere in the hotel. maybe a little thing for the hotel management to work on.

salads and chaats were ok.
desserts were below average.

"this seemed to me as mainly buffet focussed - breakfast, lunch and dinner - staying guests being the main clientele. i‚Äôve had a few meals here and couldn‚Äôt complain. standard fare with many options laid out which probably won‚Äôt wow you, but you‚Äôll find a few things that you‚Äôll like.

their service is really good and i find the ambience very relaxed. the a la carte section is quite limited and basic but they do make a pretty mean grilled fish dish.",3,Neutral
"i was staying at the hotel radisson and so got a complimentary buffet breakfast along with my stay. this review is about that experience.

i went there along with a friend and it proved very tough to find an empty table as the place was crowded with guests. after a wait of 10 minutes we found our table.

first impressions about the buffet was that the spread was huge and also contained many live counters. it had a nice mix of south indian, north indian and continental dishes.

i tried many of their dishes but the items i liked the most here are palak idly, cheese omelette, chicken sausages, fresh grape juice, white chocolate berliner and black currant yogurt.

"cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious carlson group of hotels and offers multi-cuisine dishes.

the tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical. an addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies. cascade is in gachibowli main road.

it‚Äôs located on the second floor of the property. while the lobby is inviting, it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby. as you enter cascade, you are greeted by a buddha statue.

as soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side. we had a few veg and non -veg salad, sausage with spinach. started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems it was reused. the chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself.

actually, none of the salads were any good, partly because they weren‚Äôt fresh - something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad ‚Äì ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù.

starters : we had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. they had little variety of but not so tasty starters.

anyway, rushed towards main course ‚Äòdal makhani‚Äù which was waste. or in another word, i was searching for dal makhani flavor. and i feel, in this level of restaurant at least dal makhani should be right!

moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with mutton curry. i must appreciate, mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better.

for desserts, it's a good mix of indian (including hyderabadi bestseller double ka meetha) and european delicacies.

i am not much of a dessert being, but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet.

overall, i will not call it astonishing stuff, but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot.",3,Neutral
"went there for a dinner buffet. highly disappointing. firstly, they quoted wrong price over the call. on top of it, there were very limited items in the buffet. the ones that were there were mediocre as well. we felt a road side dhaba would have been better.",2,Negative
"the largest breakfast buffet by a long shot in hyderabad. i was surprised by the choices on offer. spend the weekend here in this hotel and did not have lunch on both the days due to stuffing myself up at breakfast.
- cereals, breads, pastries
- eggs, grilled vegetables, breakfast smoothies, sausages
-idli, dosas,uthappa, vada with different condiments
- chinese noodles with some stir fry vegetables and chicken stew
- poori with bhaji and pav, chicken kheema
- cheese and cold cuts
- fresh fruits
i have probably not gone over the entire spread as there was more.

service was polite and courteous and we had no complaints whatsoever, the food also tasted pretty good. i won‚Äôt hesitate coming back just for breakfast on weekends... loved it!",5,Positive

"we came here for a buffet dinner over the weekend and it was a blast!

ambiance: well it's radisson, so the place looks amazing and one side has huge windows that overlook the gachibowli road. on the opposite is a nice glass wall with water running over it. the spread is at the end with the soups on one side veg and non-veg starters on one side and main course on the other side. live chat, breads and ice-cream counters on the side. there are beautiful chandeliers and the lighting. the place looks really good.

food: first of all the spread was amazing. we had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. the fish was really good and i enjoyed the chicken starters especially the peri peri chicken. 

in main course we had lamb stew, jamaican jerk chicken, kung pao fish and another fish item with coconut rice, steamed rice, noodles with veg and non-veg biryani. for vegetarians we had paneer tikka masala, dal, baked veggies and few other options. the best item was the jerk chicken followed by the kung pao. i also tried the samosa chat which was quite good.

finally came the desserts. there were cakes, halwa, macaroons and various other items. the macaroons were the best followed by the cheese cake.

all in all a very nice meal with a lot of options and great service.",4,Positive
"exquisite buffet breakfast spread covering south indian, north indian, a bit of american and italian cuisine with gouda cheese. i had my first pesarattu there and yes, i loved it. i really wish they would serve pancakes too and most importantly have labels for dishes which are to be made to order. you must try their range of english desserts, croissants, donuts and biscuits. they also have an array of unique jams which would melt your heart with the soft bread. overall a delightful experience.

"during our stay at radisson, we had our breakfast here and it was very good experience compared to its peers in the area.

breakfast review -

a typical buffet everyday seems very wide spread with options for everyone. there are about 10 indian options like idlis, wada, dosas to order, pav bhaji, puris, parathas to order, upma, poha etc. i couldn‚Äôt try everything, but the paneer paratha was very good and i totally recommend. the bakery counter has multiple selections too that comprises of different bread rolls, basic breads, butter/filled croissants, choices of donuts (excellent), cupcakes etc.! they also have several selections of beverages (hot and cold and soy drinks too), vegan options on request, variants of muesli and cereals, choice of cheese, salads, fruits, etc. they have western (cold cuts etc.) and asian (noodles and rice) alternatives too!

pros: widespread buffet, most of the spread is very good in taste, helpful staff, comfortable seating.

suggestion - would be nice if the staff smiles and makes it more welcoming.

"i was here with my colleagues for a formal office dinner. the ambience and music is all good and suits the occasion but the food was a disappointment. everything tasted just average but the price is too much. there were no desserts on the menu either. overall, i wouldn't recommend it unless you have a formal meeting where you do not care about the food much",2.5,Negative
"the story: visited to celebrate my spouse‚Äôs birthday.

ambience: the place was too bright for a fine dine. the presence of buffet right under the nose of fine diners was not really a good idea.

etiquette: people were nice and professional. expected minor surprise for the birthday girl as it happens in many fine dine restaurant when you book table in advance and mentioned what is the occasion.

food: moderately priced. however, they lack variety. for a fine dine, we expected a few new items on the menu but it wasn't. taste wise food was good. however, the food doesn't tickle you taste buds.

presentation: it was not too great. mediocre not too fancy.

verdict: you may visit there for a fancier place in comparison to standalone restaurant.

pros: price and location (in hyderabad)

cons: food variety and taste.",2.5,Negative
"we went to cascade for birthday dinner and opted for buffet.

ambiance: very beautiful. not clustered and has a relaxed atmosphere to it. 
service: the moment you go in they had all the details as i had booked through a app and we were escorted to our table the service has been prompt and excellent with polite staff and courteous behavior. 
food: very good spread. lot of options for salad. i went for the egg salad and the chicken salad. very tasty.
starters: good spread of veg and non veg. very happy with the hong kong fish and zaffrani chicken. both were very tasty and must have. in veg crispy veg was a must have. most of the starters were cold. considering we went almost at the beginning not sure how it can be cold so fast. moving on to the main course. another great spread and good options for veg and non veg. fish was very salty so i had to pass that. other dishes were very good and mashed potato is a must try. chettinad chicken was another must have. they had rotis and nans to order (live). i tried the mongolian rice from the live counter. did not excite my taste buds much. another problem with the main course some items were cold or lukewarm. 
some more options in main course was one veg biryani, mutton biryani, chicken curry, chicken curry was something i would go for again but not so much happy with the biryani but again being a hyderbadi the taste buds for biryani is absolutely different. 
desserts: another vast variety and i will give it 10/10. 

overall: if not for the food being cold and fish item being salty the rating would have been better. overall i would recommend this place for a casual dining. if you are looking for a place to have a relaxed atmosphere and have food at leisure away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to be. 
suggestion: i some how feel the placing of the spread was not apt. i mean it was very confusing at time and we had to take help again and again. for example. soups is placed after the biryani. a little more organized would be good...",3.5,Neutral
"a buffet with a nice spread and value for money pricing is always in demand. the ‚Äúspices unlimited‚Äù buffet at cascade, the all-day dining restaurant at radisson hitech city is an example of this. the newly revamped menu of this buffet, on for both lunch and dinner, ensures that everyone has something suiting his palate. quite a number of live counters make this even more interesting.

the buffet is priced at an attractive rs 1255 (all taxes included). invited for a review of the buffet, i first did a recce of the items served. i was happy to note that huge spread had something for everybody. there were dishes from different cuisines, ranging from north indian, south indian, local hyderabadi, pan-asian to continental. live counters included those for dosa, ice creams as well as pasta and pizza. the dessert counter looked pretty extensive too.

among the starters was paniyaram, the round batter balls popular as a breakfast or snacks. this was served with three types of chutneys ‚Äì coconut, mint and tomato. i usually do not try veg starters but this was soft and good and the chutneys were delicious.
 

other vegetarian starters included potli samosa, kothmir vada, and assorted vegetables in chilli sauce. veg sushis were also on display, but i did not try it.

chicken quesadilas filled with a nice stuffing and grilled was one attractive dish in the non-veg section. fish tikka was a little bit too spicy for me. chicken nuggets, pepper fish and shanghai chicken dry were the other non-vegetarian appetizers.

the pizzas for the day included a simple margarita as well as chicken pizza.i tried a couple of dosas from the live counter ‚Äì my choice was the kheema dosa though the beetroot dosa was a novelty too for its looks, like the coloured burgers which are in vogue these days.

the buffet also had an extensive salad bar with highlights such as braised chicken & mushroom salad and roasted lamb with onion & cabbage.

over to the main courses. continental cuisine seems to be a strong point of the chef team. the vegetarian main courses included balsamic grilled vegetables, a dish which had babycorn, carrots and beans in a balsamic vinegar based sauce. the sweet and sour vegetable caponata was another dish of note. lamb ossobuco, an italian main course of lamb shanks with a dark gravy was one dish that was really good. poached fish in a watery gravy did not have much of taste, the same applies for the roasted potatoes.

the chinese part of the buffet had quite a good collection too. fish thai red curry went well with szechuan noodles. there was a vegetarian dish mushroom & bamboo shoot in scallion sauce which also attracted my attention.

the indian section had biryanis, both veg and non-veg which are must for any hyderabadi buffet. the other local dish was hyderabadi fish curry. from the andhra kitchen, kodi koora and ulavacharu made their mark. maa ki dal and matar paneer were the punjabi dishes served.

i am not much of a dessert person, but was happy to see a large number of desserts in the buffet. sweets included shrikhand, rasmadhuri and hot chocolate brownie with ice cream. 
 

overall, i will not call it extraordinary stuff, but it was a nice spread and a value-for-money buffet. the lunch buffet which i attended on a weekday had a huge rush, pointing to the popularity of the restaurant. the menu changes every day so that the regular clientele is provided with a change of taste.

"an evening in the radisson itself is one it's kind. and when the food is unlimited, it's just bliss - a heaven on earth.

we had booked a table via nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. but somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. it is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.

when i retrospect back home, i thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. not that they were rude but they didn't care much. the manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.

well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. the best part was the dessert section. if had a variety of spreads. it was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
oh, boy! i had a ball.

had the staff had been a little attentive, i'd have rated an easy 4.0! i guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the nearbuy. but we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

radisson hyderabad hitec city has lauched an all-new buffet at their all-day dining restaurant cascade and i was invited to try it out recently.

being housed in a star property, the place has subtle interior designing, a great buffet area and a sprawling dessert counter with a mind blowing array of desserts.

while i loved the samosas, cheese calzones, a couple of indian dishes from the buffet like the butter garlic naan and the curries, overall their food does leave a lot to be desired. desserts such as black current ice cream and brownies were good.

1. food variety: very less compared to any star rated hotels in similar bracket. we were offered only 2 types of veg and non veg starters and without even mentioning the dish name. no mutton items what so ever, neither in starters, nor in main course.

2.  the service was poor and slow. i am not sure whether that is for quantity of staff or the quality of staff.
none of the staff was nice or responsive in a way that makes you feel good.
3. the quality of food changed with subsequent refill.  even the ice creams were too sweet.",1,Very Negative
"went for team lunch. have been here in the past too but experience this time was not at all good. food was not good especially the ones that were refilled. it appeared as if chef changed in between. breads were too dense, desserts too sweet, chicken overcooked. most disappointing was the service which is not at all expected from a brand like hyatt. very slow service with a i don't care attitude. had to wait very long for some of the requests. the only good thing was probably the decor. and no one will come back only for that.",2,Negative
"i have been here for breakfast. its a huge spread as other 5 star properties usually have, but i saw a great variety and different kind of a menu here. for me, a waffle cart was the best part. i just loved the hot and crispy waffles with maple syrup, nutella and berries compost. do ask for a chef's special. the breakfast option with the stay is a must pick and do try as much as possible from the spread.
a few other things which i liked were the baked potatoes. just loved them.
another good thing about them was that they did not cut the fruits beforehand. you had to select your choice and they were cut right in front of you. in the juices section, i could remember a carrot ü•ï ginger, tulsi, aloevera and many such. detox water was another addition. apart from these, you could chose the fruits and veggies you wanted and they would make a fresh juice right in front of you.

main course : only 2 biryanis (veg n chicken). and just a paneer curry and chicken curry with some fancy namedesserts :
ice creams only strawberry n chocolate flavors which are semi solid n turns to liquid by the team you eat it.

"amid the busy lanes of financial district, lies this serene place with lots of greenery and makes one feel pleasant on the outset. a little ahead when you walk through the lobby, lies this very spacious restaurant. very well managed place i must say. spacious, well lit with the usage of a lot of natural lighting. the ac temperature was a tad bit on the higher side which was informed to one the the staff but didn't find much difference even after informing.

service was slow and a little out of place. we asked if they could get milkshakes as we had kids with us. the lady who went to check this has never returned or answered the query. next, we found the glasses a little smelly which we asked to be replaced. but was never done. the rotis took a lot of time to come. clearing the used plates took way too long despite informing multiple times. asked for shawarmas and some food from the live counters which never happened or only a part of it was served. requested for the dessert section to be extended a little further but again, took away without informing.

coming to the food, there's loads of choice. except for a few items on the menu, nothing is worth a hyatt standard. loved the ariselu live counter. shawarmas tasted bland and could not take more than one bite. mutton curry was too oily and no meat in it. it was filled with bones. also liked the varieties of rice available.

overall, a place that could be so much more than what it currently is. if only this was better managed, it has the potential to be the best.",2,Negative
my worst dinner experience ever.. the buffet‚Äôs spread is the smallest you will find any where.. only 2 starters. biriyani was horrible. steamed rice was half cooked. the limited options of curry were also unpalatable. my friends had chicken and even that was half cooked. my money wasted. would never think of going there ever.,1,Very Negative

"went for lunch today and i had high expectations on taste of the food.
i ordered murg malai tikka, tariwala chicken both werent very much tasty. chicken of maki tikka were not much tender as well. it was not a good experience wrt food. staffs were good and polite as usual. one cannot ride on the brand value and compromise on the taste. i hope this feedback is taken positively",2,Negative

"food was alright a good 8/10, but, there was almost zero attention given to us in terms of service., and we had to wait a good 10 minutes even before we were given the menu. and, this was at a time, when the only table occupied inside the restaurant was us. outside, there were probably 2 tables occupied. surprising that they couldn't manage 3 tables. maybe this is a harsh review and there was an event happening at the hotel and they were understaffed., but, for a hotel chain like hyatt, not acceptable.",1,Very Negative

extremely expensive for the food they serve... i happen to go there on my birthday night and the food was just pathetic and over priced.. i wouldn‚Äôt have mind spending if the food was good however it wasn‚Äôt... this place is not at all for wine lovers as they serve the worst wines at sky high prices... the only reason they are getting 2 stars from me is coz of their staff,2,Negative

"sadly our visit to hyatt wasn't the type one would want to remember. we were attempting to use zomato gold - out of the 4 of us, 2 had gold and to start with they told us we would need to physically sit on different tables to use both gold memberships! note : it was 2:30 at night and the whole restaurant was completely empty. we suggested let's do two bills and create the notion of 2 tables if needed (why though i don't know, zomato clearly says there is no limit of how many gold's can be used at a table) but even that was not agreeable, they just kept repeating we would need to physically move to two separate tables!! needless to say, the visit just went down hill from there :(

"had an amazing brunch at collage, hyatt hyderabad.

i generally stay away from clicking pics at a buffet unless it‚Äôs something on our table but we were smitten by the desserts so much that i couldn‚Äôt resist clicking them. each dessert was an amazing piece of craftsmanship, delicately plated and arranged (esp for something at a buffet).

the food and spread were equally awesome. there was sushi üòç, mexican üòç, indian, asian and pizza.

the mexican spread was plenty with nachos being my favorite as they came with lot of sides like guacamole, salsa, mango salsa and parmesan. didn‚Äôt explore the asian side much but they had steamed veg and chicken momos. the live counters consisted of pindi chole, several types of paranthas, appam & stew.

the sushi was good but not great, especially the wasabi didn‚Äôt have a strong flavor. but being a buffet we were still satisfied with what they had.

the ambiance was really pleasant initially when we were seated. later when we started sweating though we realized we were seated at a bad table as it was nearer to the door leading to the outside dinning area and that is where they also placed their live counters. although they could close the door it was constantly getting opened and no one bothered to close it.",4,Positive
"visited this place yesterday after going through some of the very good reviews and i must say it's the worst experience for us, we ordered pizza and it smelled very bad . secondly we ordered caesar salad and chicken was rubbery and we ended up eating only salad then we ordered club sandwich and spaghetti pasta , club sandwich was ok but again spaghetti was tasteless and bland and had to leave whole dish. didn't expected such a bad quality food from brand like hyatt and they ended up spoiling our evening .",1,Very Negative

went for a lunch buffet. the best item i had from their spread is cut watermelon. is this real hyatt or fake? more than half of the items were served cold. every crispy item was soggy as if it was out in open for 2-3 days. i want to rate this place with no stars. i will advise everyone in my circle against visiting here for lunch !! choose any other place.,1,Very Negative

had hot chocolate was not worth trying and camomile tea which was good enough. loved the ambiance. hospitality is something which i loved the most.,4,Positive
"visited this place for dinner. classy ambience given it is hyatt but i would rate the food a notch lower than it's pricier cousin in banjara hills. food - mushroom soup and veg sushi were quite well made. tried japanese style udon noodles along with japanese curry and maybe it is a matter of taste but both the dishes had excess soya sauce making them salty and bitter. i was later told that the noodles should be paired with yamakazi whiskey and the curry with jasmine rice to counter the soya sauce taste. it sounded like a good advice but a little late for this time. for dessert, brownie with ice cream was ordered and it was easily the best item. overall pricing is decent for the quality and ambience. worth visiting.",4,Positive
"i have been a collage frequent visitor, not to do much with food but i met hy husband for the first time there. so i have tried their brunch many times, and i can finally say that for the cost, their sunday brunch is good but they need a little more spread and little more taste. also the staff is sweet but very slow on brunch days since they expect self service on that day.",4,Positive

"went for a sunday bruch and compared to other places of the same league the staff is definitely the most friendliest üòÄ, but the food options are the bottom most on my list. the food is good definitely, but for a sunday brunch the options are extremely limited compared to what's being offered around. i am thankful to the staff for pulling together a cheese platter just to accompany my wine and for that i took them to 4 from my initial 3* . sometimes the smiles and the courtesy make a lot of difference and might want me to visit again. the beverage (alcohol üòã) menu is very limited , does not match back to others - i hope they match it up. we had to separately order drinks as there was nothing on their selection that we drank !! üòã. and before i forget , their dessert bar is good !",4,Positive

"friday afternoon, lunch, collage - hyatt gachibowli. awesome!! so being a foodie both me and my wife, when we have the option almost every time we‚Äôll choose the buffet. so did today. the food was delicious, almost every each item was tasteful, very few were on the average side. they have 3 main counters, one with asian food, one continental, and one with soup, salads and desserts. the have have live chat counter and they will cook pizza and pasta if you have a request. i think that the stars of the day were salami pineapple salad and the blueberry cheese cake.
ambiance was peaceful and having the option of eating outside (al fresco - italian) is always a plus. service very good, staff was quick and helpful. all in all, a very good experience.

"sometimes the most unexpected evenings can turn out to be the best one. me and my wife both food lovers don't enjoy 5 star buffets and hence we avoid.
we ended up here as someone dear gifted us a couple dinner voucher and with just few weeks left for its validity we decide to give the place a visit on thursday evening.
closeby to our office we reached the place located in nanakramguda just near the amazon office and opposite waverock.
we presented the voucher and they guided us inside with a preference of outdoor or indoor seating. we choose the former.
the ambience us very nice dimly lit with slow breeze.. would be even better during winter months.
we ordered for some cold drinks and went onto explore the buffet. a fine spread with a good assortment of indian and continental dishes. one could take noodles and pasta from live counters.
starters
soups , salads , dimsum, fried chicken- the options for typical indian starters are less- when enquired by the staff attending us about the quality we told them about the having less of indian starters - they promptly arranged for some fried fish and chicken

main course
biryani rice, wet varieties of chicken, mutton and fish, one could lean into the continental side too with fried rice and noodles

desserts
the best spread in hyd from my experience. it ranged from variety of sweet bakery products to the indians traditional sweets. none of them will disappoint you. people who have a habit of starting the buffet backwards are in for a treat

overall we spent about 3 hours chit chatting enjoying the food and experience amazing service. must recommended for people who want to just unwind after a hectic work day

"there are two restaurants, and they are collage, a multi cuisine restaurant and deori, authentic india cuisine restaurant. i always have my breakfast and dinner at collage except the first day at this hotel.
many service staffs take order and serve foods. all of them are thorough in the mindset of serving customers. especially, among these staffs, [parmeshwar] and [lalmalsawmi] have very good sense of service, and are outstanding to understand what customers really want.
from the moment of entry to the collage to the exit, they really care about my moving path within the restaurant. in case of parmeshwar, he always greets me with smiley face and guides me to my table. he always asks my feeling of the day and recommends the food as per my mood. he is always getting me things i ask for and never forgets brings me things whereas others sometimes forgets as they are always busy and be asked by other customers for things on their way to get something i ask for. he has very good knowledge and insights of the industry and field in which he work and talk with me the way it needs to be improved for better service. as for lalmalsawmi, she always keeps an eye on me. she brings me chopsticks or kimchi, depending on the food i order even though i do not ask. she knows how many ice cubes i like in a glass depending on the types of beverages i drink. she never forgets to have water bottles frozen in a freezer a day before i play golf because i drink a lot of water while i play golf under the smoking hot weather. this is something i even forget myself and that is why i really want to thank her. generally, the grade of service from this restaurant is excellent, but as i mentioned above, i specially want to convey a lively sense of gratitude from the bottom of my heart.",5,Positive
"i have been staying at hyatt hyderabad gachibowli for seven (7) weeks as of today.
first, my stay at this hotel could not be any better because of the services and hospitality that this hotel is providing to me especially in terms of food.

my first concern in terms of going abroad is about food. i usually go on business trips for more than three months staying at one country. regardless of your nationality, just imagine how hard it would be to have food, which you have never had in your life, and you have to deal with the food more than one month. when you stay at a hotel and the hotel prepares same of similar dishes almost every day, you will be easily sick and tired of having the food all the time. besides, india is a country where it is hard to find restaurants that serve pork or beef dishes. furthermore, as being a korean, cilantro or coriander are something that we are not used to and do not use in the food cooking, but most dishes in india are with this herb regardless of the type of food; italian, japanese thai or chinese. however, i find foods at this collage restaurant at hyatt hyderabad is not using those herbs for western or asian food, and this is what i like this restaurant the best. besides, for buffet dinner, majority of the food are daily changed. i personally consider this the most important factor for long-term stay guest just like me.

therefore, my food life at collage @hyatt hyderabad is always happy because of so much efforts the <<chef prashant>>, <<chef pushkar>>, <<chef sankhar>> and <<chef santosh>>, are putting into to cater my taste. in addition, they study korean food or other asian food and cook for me as special treatment to please me. sometimes, we even talk about food making and recipes, and they cook some special food as per my special request.

during breakfast and dinnertime, these chefs always come to my table and ask if the buffet foods at the collage restaurant fit my taste.

i strongly recommend everyone that collage is a place you must have meals during your stay at hyderabad. lastly, through this review, i sincerely express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.",5,Positive

we had dinner at this place last night. the spread was quite lavish but we personally felt that non-vegetarian dishes were less when compared to the pricing of the buffet. the food was average as compared to the other hyatt at banjara hills. the only thing i enjoyed was the fresh ravioli pasta they were serving. and also they had no soft drinks included in the buffet which is quite stingy. but the service is top notch and the staff always keeps a tap at your table and was eager to serve us which was great.,3,Neutral

"was visiting my in laws for the first time. to celebrate the occasion we came here after more than hour long drive. and oh boy, did this place disappoint!? not only did they lack the basic services like serving papad and water in the beginning, they made blunders like serving long island ice tea to a pregnant woman instead of the lemon ice tea that she ordered. we were a group of 11 people and were seated in a private room. we had to keep going out of the room to call the waiters only to be responded with an arrogant attitude, especially by the restaurant manager parmeshwar from lucknow. each order took a long time to come and was served cold. and when i say served, i don't mean served by them. oh no, the waiters simply kept all the dishes on one side of the table and left it to us to serve ourselves. despite of this, on lack of better judgment, we made a horrible mistake of ordering the dessert which we just left after a bite because it was that bad. needless to say, our night was ruined and to end it all, just when we thought it can't get any worse, they over billed us. we spent 20 mins to get it corrected. the icing on the cake was, the charged us for the long island ice tea as well üòÇüòÇ.
please avoid this place at all costs. and you'll be saving a lot! üòÖ you'll also save yourselves from mosquito bites because they'll refuse to provide you with a mosquito repellent when you ask for it.
p. s- if you're a cheese enthusiast, please don't make the same mistake of ordering the cheese platter as we did. for ‚Çπ600, they served us stale cheese with few almonds, crackers and 2 apricots. whoever originally came up with this dish, must have shifted somewhere n his/her grave when these people had the audacity to serve something like this to us.",1,Very Negative

"for a tram dinner on a thursday, i listed down few places and finally desided to go to ‚Äúcollage ‚Äì hyatt hyderabad gachibowli‚Äù. i very shorty realized that it was a wrong choice.

except the place, nothing was good. specially the menu and the food was not really good.

the items on the buffet were so limited that i hardly had anything to eat. multi-cuisines (on the website: continental, italian, north indian, chinese, asian, thai), but in reality only continental and asian.

that too without a chicken starter in the continental department and the fish served was so salty that it was not at all eatable. not even a single indian item was found in the entire menu.

"went for sunday brunch with a lots of expectations about the food & spread. was going over after a very long gap. truly disappointed to see the brunch at this level. ‚òπÔ∏è
very less options of non-veg on the buffet both in indian & western.
only a chicken pie, & an oriental chicken dish inside. in the indian had only biryani & raara gosht.
the highlight was in place like hyatt your serving vada pav as part of the sunday brunch, come on you must be really kidding me, i am sure you can do better than this. üòÄ
lauki mussalam on the vegetarian spread just to name a few of the not so appetising options there. ‚òπÔ∏è
pizza was just like an indian papad with some dry chicken and cheese on top.
the place has just got some upgrade only in terms of just some artifacts new linen etc, but the food quality & buffet spread is so so so disappointing. ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è

"#invitedbyrawpressery #bloggerhaul 

so, buffet breakfasts is something i particularly enjoy and the one i had at collage, hyatt hyderabad was quite a decent one at that. 

hyatt gachibowli is a beautifully done property and collage is one of its pretty restaurants. with a variety of options to choose from, the buffet breakfast a quite a steal.

from american favorites like muffins, donuts, waffles and croissants to indian delicacies like masala dosa, idli and usal pav, most of the things were delectable. fresh cut fruits, juices and salads, live omelet counter, tea, coffee, milk, different types of juices, a selection of breads, different types of jams and cheese, well, the list is endless. 

overall, a lovely relaxed sunday morning spent, this!

"the best place in hyderabad to have pork and beef together. amazing taste & quality of meat, a paradise for north eastern cuisine lovers, zing's serves large varieties of non-veg dishes in a pocket-friendly budget. just a reminder, this is not a place to have vegeterian foods. i have read many reviews explaining how the vegetarian people were apalled by the smell of raw/ cooked meat while visiting this restaurant. they are very misleading and misinformative. first of all, you shouldn't be here if you are looking for veg momo or veg fried rice. period.
i tried almost every pork starters and every mocktails available in their menu. not once i have been disappointed. every food items is tasty enough to deserve 5 rating.
the one little place for improvement could be to increase the number of staffs. due to excessive demand, they find it difficult to cater to everyone at the same pace, hence you'd find many reviews telling how their service is slow, how people waited for 1 hour after ordering for food to show up. personally, i've never experienced such delay.

p.s. they cook amazing ramyun noodles.",5,Positive
"very authentic food, different from what you get elsewhere in hyderabad. their dumplings, pork ribs, beef fry, everything was awesome. great job !",5,Positive
"this place has been a bookmark for me since very long as there are only few places which can serve pork. after seeing all those positive reviews in zomato, i decided to give it a try.
i along with 3 of my friends went on a friday eve to this place.

appetizers :

1. deojikalbi : this is a pork appetizer, we loved it very much and repeated the order. for the second time, we asked the restaurant staff to increase spice levels in the dish which turned out to be really delicious.

2. pork ribs : i did not enjoy this dish really much. meat was tender but the sauces they used did not satisfy my taste buds. i dunno if north-east people love this type of food but it's ok, it was my first time.

3. pepper chicken : due to unavailability of lemon grass chicken, we had to order this appetizer. taste was good , nothing fancy.

main course :

1. ramyun with pork : we ordered 2 rumyun with pork, taste was good but we liked the other dish which we ordered.

2. soba noodles with pork and veggies : this dish tops the list. luckily, i am the one who ordered this dish and my friends were having ramyun.
soba noodles have a dark sauce and intense taste compared to ramyun. if tasted really delicious. i cannot say how perfect this dish is.

3. naga-chicken rice : when restaurant staff placed this dish on our table, i saw chicken was undercooked. i asked the same to them, they said this is how north-east people like to eat, a bit chewy. i thought chalo let's try it, but chicken was so chewy that it's taking 5 minutes for me to complete a small piece of it.
i was disappointed with this dish.

overall experience :

food : 3.5 / 5
service : 3/5 ( it was too slow)
ambience : 3.5 / 5 (cute lil place but gets crowded on weekends)

i will definitely recommend this place to everyone. sometimes we need to surprise our taste buds with some new cuisine üòúüòã and this place has got delicious food too.",4,Positive
"the authentic taste of north east indian delicacies, one will find here with mouthwatering dishes. good place good location. but the quantity of food per dish served is little smaller.",4,Positive
"couldn't resist posting this review. has been visiting this place since the time it opened - has been there multiple times. never before felt this urge of posting a review since the food always stood out and dominated the service.

but nothing changed over the time in terms of service, rather it's turned worse over time. there can't be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service. if food is the only yardstick, they fail to beat that as well. dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste.

as a customer, i would rather not visit to wait for two ordered dishes for an hour. worse food that can be had sooner is always better than slightly better food with infinitely worse service.",2,Negative
food is not bad but not like northeast. service are very slow n staff will not response properly. i didn't understand its northeast food or korean food. i ask for northeast food n disappointed.,3,Neutral
"have been to this place so many times that i‚Äôve lost count. great food, (especially the beef and pork dishes, although at times some of them seem similar)
good value for money... be patient for the service. worth visiting at least once, then give it a chance to win you over",5,Positive
"a fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!

drinks:

1. berry blast: loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. the right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.

2. green ice mountain mojito: you can find green apples in this drink. a little sour, although i liked it.

i would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.

teriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. nothing special about its taste. this is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.

beef & pork kimchi bokkum bap: i just liked the flavor of the rice. both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. they were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. the piece were eatable, and not much chewy.

pork & beef naga chilly curry: the flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. the taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. the gravy is ravishing as well.

service: just fine. the waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.

service: 3.5/5",4,Positive
"a little understaffed when i visited on a friday evening, and while the food lived up to its usual great standards, i was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable. i have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times i have been here. kudos to the team for their effort, nonetheless. i know it was a busy night for a small 2 person service team.",3,Neutral
"went there after hearing a lot of buzz about this being a go to north eastern place, but such a bummer!
ambience : 1star: the place doesn't not have exhaust or ventilation and has only 2 acs which seemed to not work. it's connected to the kitchen so was smelling of the meat. no music. we were asked to occupy a table which had used plates still kept.
service: 1 star. the staff didn't seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us.
not to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktails(we already read about their slow service so was expecting it)
non veg food: momos were very average like that of zomos may be.
veg: the ramyum noodles were literally veg maggi! very misleading name and price.
veg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice.",2,Negative
"this place should realise that a dine-in restaurant has to provide some basic service and just having decent food is only the starting. the place offers good for nothing snobbish service by staff that cannot communicate and who don't give a damn about you. you can die asking for something and you won't get it. they don't even bother to keep cutlery at the table, not even tissue papers. the ac does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven.

coming to food. if you manage to get what you like on the menu, it is a miracle. they open at 11.30. we asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 1.30 and were told very unapologetic, rather rudely that they don't have it. finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had, we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order. now the taste. the ingredients are very good and fresh. the quality of pork is great. the taste doesn't have much variation. everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different. after a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice. if this is how the food of north eastern india is, well, i'll avoid that geography. and i'll surely avoid this eatery. there is no excuse for bad and rude service!",1,Very Negative
"this was on our list of places to eat in hyderabad for a while, but what kept us not going is the popularity with meat! i am a vegetarian and wondered what i will get, seeing bibimbap on the menu , i had to try it.

we ordered fried tofu appetiser and bibimbop and freshlime+square.

drinks were as displayed, tofu was bit disappointing..it was literally fried tofu with sauce on it and sesame seeds..can miss this if you plan to go.

do definitely try the bap! tasty and filling, great portions of the veggies, rice, sauce...although rice wasnt sticky and i thought dolsot bap always came with hot claypot..nevertheless tasty!

in the middle of the meal we asked for hot sauce and there came the sauce very tiny quantity, we were like wtf..the sauce was hot made from naga chillies yet sooo good..burned my tongue but loved every bit of it..so if you have rice remaining give this a try as well.

staff were courteous as well.

one star less just for the tofu. rest was perfect

will definitely visit again",4,Positive
"it's amazing for the people who eat beef & pork. the lemon grass chicken was good too.

"had heard about this place from a colleague of mine, post which i decided to try it myself. a quaint little place opposite sln terminus, this joint serves authentic tibetan cuisine and is a pork and beef lover's delight. we had ordered minty cucumber in mocktails, a korean appetizer tangsuyuk, kalbi bokum, smoked pork fried with bamboo shoots and teriyaki chicken. all the dishes tasted good, the teriyaki chicken was too sweet though.
would love to visit again and try out their other delicacies.",5,Positive
"this place came with high recommendations from a food expert in the industry for the last two decades or so.

visited zing‚Äôs northeast kitchen on a saturday afternoon for lunch and i wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. we ordered for :

roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. the lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. the pork melted in the mouth. beautifully prepared 5/5

steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. a weekend special !! 5/5

kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

dotsol bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. a special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

all downed with non-alcoholic (coolberg) beer.

honest food prepared with a lot of passion. absolute value for money. i would recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and especially pork preparations.",5,Positive

"starters:
üç¥kalbi bokum (sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
üç¥butter pepper garlic prawns (prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

main course:
üçΩÔ∏è naga steam fish (made with naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
üçΩÔ∏è teriyaki chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

drinks:
üçπsummer time and summer lime (orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
üçπfresh lime soda (sweet)

of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by madcapmanikin. and even though i trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. she hasn't been off with her recos even once. but zing's came highly recommended by suchismita chatterjee dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

in all honesty, when the starters arrived, i felt that the portions were quite small. i couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the enlightened one felt that they could've been a tad fresher. and even though the waiter told me that the #kalbibokum wasn't too sweet, i could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

but believe you me when i say that the main courses changed the game completely. the first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. the explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! i literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. the raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! the side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. and the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this bangal!

it was only by the end of the meal that i realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. the quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

this is comfort food! sanely priced, impeccably portioned, honest food that warms you up from within!",5,Positive
"we wouldn't have found this gem of a place if we hadn't been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch. more than a month since we visited, but it was such a treat! the place is tiny, right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it.

the menu is pretty extensive, but going by our love for pork, we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer. we ordered soba noodles with pork and veggies, naga pork curry (which came with rice) and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots.

the noodles were alright, but had sort of a maggi consistency - but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor. the naga pork curry was a revelation - spicy but so full of flavor, my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit! the fried pork was delicious too, but an overkill, going by how we were already full with the first two dishes. 

we had ordered the flavored beer they have, which was refreshing but relatively overpriced. but just for the food, i think we need to visit again. highly recommended for the cuisine they have on offer!",4,Positive

the pork belly dishes were really tasty, also appreciate the staff helping us eat the right way..",5,Positive
"this has to be one of my favorite restaurant. it is a tiny, cosy place that serves korean and northeastern food. i am reviewing it for the second time and how much i appreciate this place being a korean food fan in hyderabad where options are little less in terms of getting korean/ne cuisine. the owner is super friendly and courteous. the kimbap is good in taste, serves 10 pieces per plate which is worth the money (180bucks) accompanied by wasabi and soya sauce. just because of kimbap, i can rate this place a 4 happily.",4,Positive
"had visited this place after a friends recommendation and what a experience!! wee visited in the evening hours so we're not that hungry just wanted a quick bite. tried their chicken momo and pork ribs.. both of them were extremely delicious and cooked to perfection. we also tried there summer time mocktail but initially it was served under room temperature, after requesting them the add on some ice it tastes fine.

"northeast kitchen, located right beside pista house, has been a good find for me.

i have been there more times than i can count on my fingertips.

i love the simple ambience, and the food.
i won‚Äôt vouch for consistency though. service is slow, and really slow on a full night.

my favourite dishes here are the steaky pork ribs, smoked pork with bamboo shoot and bibimbaap. momos are decent.
soup is canned, something, i was a little shocked to find out.
their mocktails are also very good.

although there are fallacies, the food still makes me go back again and again.",4,Positive

the place usually packed but you would definitely find a table. staff is polite and friendly.
coming to food.... there is so much on the menu to try on.
pork ribs are most recommended but they are only available on weekends.
beef with onions and chilly is good. they come with complimentary rice which is unlike normal indian rice. more like how koreans eat.
you get non alcoholic beer here, which goes well with the food.",4,Positive
"having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that's a part of india, but different from the other usual cuisines, led me and a bunch of my friends to zing's for dinner.

first up, we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant. the starters were quite good- spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations (pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork).
the main course, however, was disappointing, or perhaps we expected something else. the ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of top ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them. there was not enough broth either (which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles). the teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally.

the best thing would be the prices- everything is so resonably priced, it's not easy to find non-veg (especially pork, beef etc) at these prices!

one major area of feedback would be the service. they have an extremely laidback, dont-really-care attitude, and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time.

a little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently- maybe even start a franchise :)

decent food. average service. affordable pricing. big on non vegetarian delicacies.

small place with cute interiors serves up some mouth watering momos, bruschetta and ramen.
good things take time, especially if it‚Äôs a newbie kitchen trying to serve you food. be patient. the service is slow but the food is good.

if you‚Äôre looking for a bowl of north eastern style of ramen, try their version of it. simple, soupy and well spiced. it‚Äôs a bowl of comfort. let‚Äôs not get your hopes high just yet. it‚Äôs their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic ramen that is usually popular otherwise.

the momos are good, soft and melt in the mouth- must try. they run out of the vegetarian ones rather soon.

anyways coming to the food, a great place for most things pork. my favorite dish which is something i totally gorge over is the bosam. nicely sliced pieces of pork belly, kimchi and tender pices of chillies. each bite is a bliss. the kimchi pork fried rice is good too though i wish they could improve upon the quantity of pork in the dish.",3,Neutral
"my 1st visit to the place for lunch and i enjoyed their food.
we ordered lemongrass chicken it was nice but not strong lemon grass flavor though. but the chicken stew with rice was awesome, it was very light yet very flavor full. i will surely visit this place again to try their korean menu. #foodlove",4,Positive
"having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place, and the 4.5 rating on zomato, it was on my wishlist for ages, but i was always skeptical of the taste, being too authentic and a totally new cuisine. the former proved to be true, and was the primary reason i didn't have a very pleasing dinner.

it's a small and cute little diner like cafe, with minimalistic and soothing interiors. the sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially, but i got used to it in just a few minutes. some room freshener would do the trick.

the items are priced very cheap, i had high expectations, but only to learn later the portions are just too small. we had:

üçó spicy drums of heaven (140/5) - the only thing i could properly finish. a typical batter fried chicken. almost south indian and spicy in taste, but the coating was too thick.

üçó chicken succulent yakitori (130) - 3 skewers with tiny chicken chunks, spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle. texture was good, but taste, average. sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like.

üçó chicken momos (130/5) - standard, good amount of filling, with a very pungent ginger flavor. the coating was thick too. chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy, and went well with the momos.

üêΩ bosam (170) - it was my first time trying pork belly, and i can't really judge, but it felt fatty and gooey. the pieces were drenched in grease. served with spicy kimchi which i loved.

üçú chicken ramyum noodles (180) - big bowl of noodles, what looked like maggi but was only a close resemblance. scarce chicken pieces, undercooked, dry and hard noodles, and overall a very bland taste.

üêü naga steam fish (250) - this was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant. and i couldn't tolerate it. a very very pungent and strong odor. the fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection. served with steamed white rice.

whatever i mentioned about the food, was just my impression, and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine, i didn't really like it.

however, one thing that was disappointing was the service. it was slow and just took ages. once the food arrived, it was fine but again the bill took more than 20 minutes.

as many others have already said, i guess, the strong point of this place is their pork preparations, and i would recommend this place purely for that. an elaborate menu with lots of options, priced well.

here's my overall score:
food - 3.5/5 (not judging what i tried first time/don't know about)
ambience - 4/5 (get a room freshener!)
service - 3/5
vfm - 4/5",4,Positive
i would give a negative star if possible for their hygiene and service. we ordered our food at 9:30pm and after an hour's wait they come and say that what we ordered from the menu isn't available. we had to order something else and wait for another 30mins and then to my surprise i found hair in the food! so in short it a was a terrible experience.,1,Very Negative
"had a lot of expectations after checking out the positive reviews for zing's. there was some weird smell when we entered the outlet which was a bummer. we asked for momos which were not available. so we got lemongrass chicken and the portion size was very disappointing and shocking. drums of heaven was another appetizer that we ordered which was below average. we then ordered ramyuen noodles which was tasting and looking very similar to maggi. we also got ohm fried rice which was very bland and tomato ketchup was used for presentation. the waiter who took our order looked disinterested. so, i really don't understand what the hype is about. thumbs down üëé",1,Very Negative

fried rice with omelette - 2/5(nothing much)
pork bimbipop- 3/5 (the only decent thing in the main course.

"had the misfortune of visiting this place on new years day. we were given the run around with the table, then it took them 30 mins to take our order only to forget all about it. after an hour of reaching the place we realise the food isn‚Äôt even ready.

not even an apology. thoroughly disappointed.",1,Very Negative
the food is amazing. their service needs to improve a lot. 5 stars for tasty food and elaborate menu. the staff was very friendly and can help you with ordering the right dish.,5,Positive
"the most amazing naga beef i've ever had. the pork ribs are to die for. the pork belly melted in our mouth. most of the dishes are tasty as hell.
portion is kinda small but the price is correct for the portions.
service is a bit slow. one area they really need to improve is to get more and/or better trained staff.
but the flavor of the food makes up for everything making me give 5 stars.",5,Positive
love for asian food brought me to this place. this place would accomodate 30 -35 people at once approximately. food are well made with almost authentic taste. tried pork momos which tasted really good specially the pickle that goes well with momos and you would not find it anywhere else in hyderabad as per my knowledge. after that we ordered dotsol bibimbap which was a colorful food which would please your eyes and ofkorse your savory mouth and fill your stomach for sure (depends how much you eat :p i was full with one bowl) . one more dish that we had ordered was ramyun noodle which i felt almost like maggie with a very slight difference but it was soothing and filling. only thing that had disaapointed me was the late service. we almost had to wait for 40 mins for our food.,4,Positive
"this tiny joint serves excellent northeastern & east asian food. their beef curry with naga peppers is heavenly. deojikalbi was excellent as well. the beef soba noddles was also good, though less so than the other two items. the portion sizes are a little small, but then again the prices are pretty damn cheap as well. the one area where they can improve is the speed & efficiency of service, but since it's fairly new & has a very small staff at this point (possibly family run ?), i'm optimistic that they will improve as they mature.",5,Positive
"i seriously didn't understand the buzz around this place. decided to have sunday lunch here owing to the good rating of this place. the staff didn't really give any attention and we had to find a table for ourselves.
many items on the menu were not available even on weekend and we settled for veg clear soup, mushroom & spinach soup to start with. the quantity of soups was a bummer and it was a huge bowl quarter filled with soup. if they plan to serve this quantity then they should switch to smaller bowls to atleast give illusion of a filled bowl. mushroom & spinach soup tasted like maggi /knorr soup and not fresh.
for starters we opted butter pepper garlic prawn. it was served in a small plate with even smaller portion. 5 tiny prawns for starter definitely doesn't justify. the taste was average , better than soup.
for main course we decided dotsol bibimbap and naga chicken curry. main course was way better in taste and we really liked bibimbap. naga chicken was good in taste but had mostly bones.
the portion size is major disappointment here and its evident across all courses. another point of concern is their service. be it taking order, suggesting food or even table service, the staff is not really helpful and takes forever to respond.",2,Negative
visited this place with much expectations..but got disappointed with the service and the bad smell inside the restaurant..we ordered chicken momo and lemongrass chicken..chicken momo was very okayish...n after waiting for a long time the owner informed that they need lot more time to make the dish..as we couldn't wait more did not get chance to taste the dish...service needs to be improved..,2,Negative
"food is awesome and loved the chicken momo and the chicken noodles. good authentic food, a must visit for any momo and noodle love. however expect a delay in service.",5,Positive
"one of the very few places that i tried north eastern food. the place has a cosy setup with interiors and cutlery that totally go with the theme of the place.

we ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl, ramyan noodles, bruschetta and doenjang jjigae. we absolutely loved the jjigae, which is similar to a vegetable stew and absolutely rich with flavours. the teriyaki bowl and noodles were definitely above average. they served the teriyaki bowl with saut√©ed spinach on the sides, perhaps more vegetables would have been better. all in all a great experience!",4,Positive
"bad experience when ordered food from here. prices looked very reasonable while ordering, and literally the quantity was very less. they should be mentioning that if we are ordering prawns for starters they are giving exactly 6 pieces of them. very disappointed with that even though the taste is good.",1,Very Negative
"i was pretty excited looking at the 4.6 rating. but quite disappointed. i would rate the food at 4 though. but service is extremely poor. the staff isn't good at recommending dishes. the beef curry with naga chilli isn't good, probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste. the pork belly was good. beef fry wasn't great because meat was undercooked. the steam country chicken curry was good.

i would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because i really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now.",3,Neutral
"cute little place with great food and superb presentation. the interiors are simple and pleasant. the place is very neatly maintained and appears hygienic.
this place is just walkable from my office and it has been my go to place since the time i discovered it.
i love their garlic prawns, chicken yakitori, teriyaki chicken, and noodles.",5,Positive
very low quantity for the price,1,Very Negative
"hello guys, this will be honest review. we visited yesterday(7th dec) as we heard a lot about this restaurant. we had a mixed experience here. when you enter this place, you will definitely feel a bad smell inside. that was really disgusting. we ordered chicken lollipop, smoked pork, bosam and ramyun noodles. food was awesome except bosam. we didn't like the taste. so if you want to try northeast food, surely you can give a try.",3,Neutral
"perfect northeast kitchen in the town...
the pork rice is delicious and noodles are good...don't expect a regular noodles...the non alcoholic beers are good
and fries are very good",4,Positive
"this is my go to place. i can never get bored of their food and ambience. happy to see them in zomato. food is always great. love the ramyun noodles and bibimbap. best time to visit is on weekdays. on weekends, there's too much rush and food orders get delayed. i would suggest to add more items in their menu.",5,Positive
"been here twice in less than a month, and i hope i can keep coming back.

i absolutely love their food. the bibimbap is to die for, and the king chilly pork only slightly less so. their ice-cream also manages to be excellent.

the service is a bit shifty, but we can't have everything. unbelievable prices (for now), as well. definitely go here if you love meat.

slightly louder music and tea would be great additions, but hardly necessary.",5,Positive
"this amazing restaurant is not exactly in gachibowli. it's located between sarath city capital and sln terminus mall in kondapur.

we visited this place when it had just opened and we were surprised with the quality of the food. for starters, we had pork momos. everything including the presentation was perfect. beef soba noodles and teriyaki chicken rice alongwith roasted chilly lamb and each one was competing with the other for a place in our hearts. the beef had a lovely texture and was well cooked. it was a tad on the bland side but tasted great nevertheless.

the ambience catches your eye and one fails to control the urge to click pictures of the walls. the people are nice, so is the food. you could keep visiting it.",5,Positive
"we were soo excited about the place but somehow not satisfied.. firstly.. the place was in utter silence.. the ramyun noodles, bosam, butter garlic prawns were all just mediocre and purely serves just 1.. lack of salt was felt in some dishes.. yea but the mock tails were good..",3,Neutral
"finally some korean dishes in a restaurent in the city...!! have tried their
-bossum(korean lettuce wraps)
-dwaenjang jigae(soyabean paste gravy with vegetables)
-kalkuksu(plain noodles with chicken)
-daeji kalbi(porkbelly with ganjang sauce)
-steam fish naga chili
everything was soo good...loved the soyabean paste gravy and ssam was pretty good too.kalkuksu needs more broth to it...it was very dry with little broth...wish they didn't use instant ramen.the serving pots gives life to this place...am visiting this one again for sure.my love for asian and authentic cuisines made me visit this one and it didn't disappoint.",5,Positive
"forget the 4 or 5 rating given for this restaurant. this place is crap. i will say except plating, nothing will please your appetite. customer service, i will give -10. for 15 tables, it a single guy who was taking orders. in between all this, he is also the one who is at bill desk too. believe me they didn't served water until we are forced to ask for.

customer service - they don't deserve a rating for it.
food - 1*",1,Very Negative
"the restaurant is a nice decent place and pocket friendly too. food taste good but i personally think there are too much soya sauce mostly in everything .the menu is mainly korean with very few ne food in their main course section(for people who really want to experience northeastern food i‚Äôd suggest that the main course section might be helpful for you). over all, m happy that i found a place to hop in whenever i feel like having pork or beef.",4,Positive
"it's a fairly simple restaurant, nothing too fancy, with some parking available right in front of restaurant. however the climb is way too steep. has pork and beef on menu, a great addition to kondapur. food is good, portions are small, but that's by hyderabad standards, otherwise one dish is enough for one adult. we went on a sunday and we had to wait for close to one hour to get all items ordered, maybe we will try it on a weekday, if waiting time still is that long, it needs serious improvement. overall a new addition for niche crowd.",4,Positive
"best pocket friendly place in and around gachibowli if you are a fan of south korea, and north eastern cuisine. and, yes there's a lot of love in cooking korean food and every morsel tastes wonderful. small place, good range of menu and pocket friendly price. must try - smoked pork ribs, pork bosam , naga steamed fish and chicken ramyun noodles.",4,Positive
"i have been waiting to write a review for zing's north east kitchen for a real long time and i love what they cook n create, it's a little restaurant on the very opposite side of sln terminus, gachibowli. the food quality is amazing just feels like home, quantity and the price are reasonable. and i have lost count of the number of visits i made... strong recommendation for pork and beef lovers üòç",5,Positive
"for all the pork lovers now you have an amazing outlet right at gachibowli....great food , very good staff ...personal care from the owner ...just loved it ....",5,Positive
"an awesome foodie experience that takes you telepathically to the kitchens of north east india. will come here again and again for the taste of their food if not for anything else.

food: 4/5 the pork dishes are awesome and the noodles were delicious. this is one place where though your stomach is full your heart wants more. only thing i do not like is the noodle that they use. feels like instant noddles and i feel this could be better.

service: 3/5 service is very slow. they seem to be a family run restaurant and sometimes (which is more often than not) when they are busy service can be very slow. they have to very soon hire some more helping hand if they continue to experience this much of demand.

ambiance :  3.5/5 simple and minimalist interiors of a north eastern roadside joint.

price : 4/5 pretty decently priced for the quality and taste that they offer. it is really a steal deal.",4,Positive
"an extremely accessible joint situated on the main road with a pretty good variety of north east cuisine and a polite bunch of staff. we planned to try anything but options in pork so we ordered pork belly with veggies n kimchi salad. the particular dish is supposed to be consumed is a unique fashion. the pork belly, veggies and kimchi are to be placed on the lettuce leaf and wrapped. this combination is delicious and you would love it. next we had smoked pork ribs which i assume had barbecue sauce and sesame seeds and tastes pretty soft tender and yum. the beef curry and steamed rice was decent but extremely spicy. you can specify how spicy you want your dish and they can suggest or customise their dishes.
ambience is nothing but ordinary and it draws a decent crowd even on weekdays.
but i would definitely go back to try the other delicacies. do visit and indulge into their menu.",4,Positive
"i have been looking for good porks in hyderabad.. n finally found it . pocket friendly and delicious food you would find over here. right opposite to sln terminus, quick service, decent interior and courteous manner! pork ribs, beef curry chicken momo..the list goes on! don't miss this place ..",5,Positive
"i visited this place once and oh my oh my lemme tell you, this place is ahmaaazing! the food was amazing. we ordered pork and it tasted so good, just melted in my mouth. i am salivating just by thinking about it. maybe there was just a little extra soy sauce in the food but however it was, it was really good! highly recommended! will visit soon. chompchompchomp!",5,Positive
"though understaffed, this place is really a treat for someone who is not used to north eastern food. i took few of my friends for a treat and ordered multiple items out of which pork ribs and teriyaki chicken turned out to be amazing. keep up the good work!",5,Positive
"if u wanna try good pork in hyderabad then this is the place, love the pork dishes from starters to main course. staffs are well behaved & food is not expensive as well. a must visit for pork loversüëç",5,Positive
the food is amazing! easily one of the best pork dishes i have had in hyderabad. the restaurant set up is like a cozy little shack and this along with the food transports you to another place entirely. i'm gonna become a regular here!!!,5,Positive
"we went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while.

starting of with the pros, the decor and ambiance of this place is really good. the menu is quite interesting too, and includes a variety of chicken, pork, beef and some fish dishes. there are a few vegetarian options, but i do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian. they have a good choice of mocktails as well, and each one was really good. the pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too. the staff there was good too.

moving on to why i chose to give this a bad review- first of all, the service was really slow. took about an hour for my food to arrive. moreover, my chicken noodles tasted exactly like maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in. i had attached a picture of it for reference. moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes. a small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people. even though the taste was good, because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined.
hence the two stars.",2,Negative
"so yeah, let's start the reviewing part.
1. costly place and not much appreciated for students.
2. service is really very slow.
3. quantity is not much appreciated but kinda okay but not all dishes.
4. they had less staff.

so done with the negative part and the positive thing is that you get to have pork there which is rare in this area and the food is not that great but kinda okay. if you wanna try something new and also spend some extra bucks then go for it. not much of a satisfactory feeling here. 2 stars for the delays and less quantity of food in fat ass price. happy dining.",2,Negative
"sad experience at zing's after hearing so raving reviews about this place. folks at the restaurant were least bothered in taking our order right since we sat down on an empty table. half of the food items on the menu weren't available, maybe they need to shorten the menu just to include items that are available round the clock. we had ordered pork with bamboo shoot, which i have had quite a lot of time at my hometown (siliguri), unfortunately, this wasn't nearly as good as i had before. although i won't judge the restaurant based on just this item, as chances are it was a one off case. but the service and staff attitude was a real put off. i had very high hopes, but was completely let down. something seemed to be very off, as a restaurant having 4.6 rating usually won't come across this way. either my bad day, or the chef's.",1,Very Negative

"dunkin donuts has always been a great donut place according to me. they serve excellent coffee and burgers as well. i particularly love the naughty lucy burger, which is an all time favourite.
this time i decided to try their new grilled chicken monster burger and i was a little disappointed. as a whole, the burger tasted fine but, why on earth did the chicken burger have a layer of hash browns? such a bummer. üòê

i had a bad experience",1,Very Negative
"located in sln terminus on the ground floor, this joint has a good seating and decent ambience.

the place is a bad maintained one in terms of staff and food. a donut shop must have sugar glazed donuts at all times, but initially they refused to serve one.

finally the donut i had was the caramel vanilla, the donut was first served cold despite telling them to heat it. the donut anyways turned out to be a good one, perfectly sweet and hot. the caramel however was not upto the mark.

for the drink i had vanilla macchiato, the drink was way different from illustration. it lacked the caramel sauce on top and almost had no taste of vanilla, we also ordered for classic macchiato which tasted the same. so there was no vanilla in my coffee.

i would suggest skip this place and head somewhere else for the sweet cravings post dinner.",2,Negative
"loved the ambience of the place. also we ordered a box of six classics, and all of them were delicious. alongwith the popular chocolate ones do try the caramel, strawberry and colour pop ones too. also do try hot chocolate orange and hot chocolate hazelnut, definitely a must try place for me.",5,Positive

"i just came out of this outlet. the food is as per dd standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance.

the tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it. the wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes.

for payment too when i decided to pay through the mobile wallet, instead of the standard qr code or getting a request for the otp, i was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system wasn't working.",3,Neutral
just 5 mins from my house and been there hardly a few times because i did not quite soulfully enjoyed their donuts. the 'ugh' quotient is missing in the do-ugh-nuts here which makes me do-not do the dunkin donuts.,3,Neutral
bit costly..but taste wise its good...almost the taste of usa...good variety of items to choose from. good place to visit. ambiance is good also,4,Positive
"though the brand's famous for donuts, i'd have to start the review with their burger. after having got bored with mcd, kfc and other popular burger places, dd's burgers are just stunning. also, their bun is slightly different, which tastes even better over others.  the chicken was quite juicy with all flavors dumped in. unfortunately, it is overpriced!

coming to their staple food, they are great as well. they got tons of options, so not possible to review all of them here. but, i would highly suggest having their death by chocolate.

and, their packaging is great. i loved the boxes they provided!",5,Positive

"landed up here on a saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. following summaries my experience below-:

ambiance- the ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of dunkin. the walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the dunkin outlets i have been to in pune and mumbai. ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5

service- you pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. it is an entirely self service type of mode. nothing extraordinary. 3/5

food- we tried the following two doughnuts-:

kit kat doughnut- the doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. the chocolate factor was also less. the freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.

mango doughnut- literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. just for that 3/5.

will i come here again? i like just one here which is ugly strawberry. do try that if you like strawberries.",3,Neutral
"had naughty lucy veg burger meal, alive by chocolate, lychee litchi donuts and filter coffee dunkin style.
the burger was cheesy and tasted good. the donuts were excellent , especially the center lychee filling in the lychee litchi donut. the coffee had a hint of caramel and is worth a try. in all would have rated it at 3.5 as ac was not functional, but will go with 4 for donuts.",4,Positive

burger - naughty lucy chicken burger ( 4/5 and for people who love cheese it is 4.5/5 )
donut - alive by chocolate (4.5/5)

"simple and sweet outlet. i liked the episode outlet with some great graffiti. the service counter girl was kind of ride though as we said something for order and she ordered something else and then she argued. well, for the love of donuts - the chocolate and the mango craze and the rainbow pop were awesome. soft, spongy and colourful were the words. the taste of mango craze could be improved more though. the chocolate over the donut was little rough and it meant that way i guess. so, overall great.",3.5,Neutral
"i can't say the donuts are too tasty.if you are a sweet lover you can once try this.we ordered a pack of six and i felt no difference in each of these ,in taste they look similar except the yellow one(mango flavoured).

i didn't even feel it as fresh one ,as soon as i ordered he bought the one which he has packed it and kept as stock.overall, i was disappointed for the first time being there.

once you can try this as a snack, but it's too sweet.
ambience i can rate as 3.5/5
food-3/5",3.5,Neutral
"unhelpful and rude staff. according to zomato, they are supposed to be open till 11 but the staff gives excuses to not accept orders at 10.45 also, probably because they want to leave early. on top of that, they have the audacity to behave rudely.

"it took me so long to pen down this review, 6 days to be exact! and why you ask. well that's because i had to taste 6 donuts in all.

yess, i decided to try the festive rakhi donut box that comes with 6 mini donuts ranging from death by chocolate, chocolate filled, mango flavored, two classics, etc. all this priced at rs 199 plus taxes. this roughly came out to rs 243.

so much goodness in one box!

now i can't name each of the donuts but i can say that majority were chocolate based. of the 6 donuts, 2 were classic style and rest 4 were filled ones.

the first one was the classic sugar coated. simple and goody good.

the second one was a chocolate coated classic donut. this one was fine.

next up the mango flavored one. this one had a mango glaze on top and center filled with mango puree or jam. this was a fresh taste after so much chocolate.

the fourth one i think was death by chocolate. this one had a delicious chocolate coating on top and center filled with gooey chocolate.

the fifth one had a chocolate topping but cream filling. this one was ok.

the last one again had a chocolate topping and a vanilla filling. this one was good. the topping had some sprinkles too.

all in all a sinful treat for all donut heads out there.
definitely a must try.

breaking away from my usual style of writing i will come to the location and ambience after the food.
so this outlet is located on the ground floor of sln terminus. very easy to locate. the board is visible from the road.

the interiors like other dunkin donuts outlets is quirky with pop colour furniture and interesting wall designs. on a sunday afternoon the place was moderately crowded.

service was good. no issues there. would love to visit again!",4,Positive

ambience & seating: 3/5 (average)

the service is very bad and the reputation of such shops are going down because they're treating all the customers as those low class business meet holding people in hyderabad.

however the taste of the beverages is very bad. the below are the beverages we tried.

1. tough guy cappuccino

they need to work on making fresh chokha with fresh flavours.",3,Neutral

"this is the place for litti chokha. (drops the mic)

food : 4.5/5 the litti cokha is just amazing, sitting in hyderabad and getting such quality food that reminds you of your home town stalls is really something. would have been nicer if the chokha was a bit more hotter/spicy. but understand that such taste would not go well with lot of foodies here. i have gone there again and again for litti chokha and have very rarely tried other things. this time tried the chinese plate and really liked that too.

service : 3.5/5 it was a self service join which now services your table. timely service and good behavior there is very little more to expect.

ambiance : 3/5 has a very nicely maintained outdoor sitting beside road.

"this is a newly opened restaurant in gachibowli. it is famous for it's nizami style of cuisine. it is very spacious and has a cozy ambience with good music.

dishes that we have tried:

1. chicken hot & sour soup
2. chicken manchow soup
3. eight treasure soup
4. chicken platter
5. daawat khaas sabz kebab platter
6. daawat khaas murgh musallam
7. zafrani roti
8. paneer pasanda
9. kaddu ki kheer

the food served here is delicious and mouth-watering. the pictures of the famous dishes served here are displayed in the lcd tv's. just the pictures themselves will activate all your taste buds. if you are going with a group of 6-8 members, i suggest you order platters instead of individual starters.

we have ordered chicken platter and daawat khaas sabz kebab platter. the chicken platter comes with 4 variety of chicken starters with 6 pieces for the each variety. and veg platter is served with paneer tikka kebab, tandoori broccoli and starter of cauliflower. both veg and non-veg platters tasted great.

in the main course we have ordered the famous dish of this restaurant *daawat khaas murgh musallam* it comes with chicken marinated with ginger garlic paste and stuff with eggs and mutton keema. leaving the hyderabad biryani aside, this was the best main course item that i have tried in the recent times. it easily serves for 3-4 adults. and it is really a must try dish if you're visiting this restaurant. apart from that we have ordered paneer pasanda with zafrani roti. the paneer pasanda curry tasted little bit sweet and none of us have liked it.

and coming to desserts we have ordered kashmiri rabdi and kaddu ki kheer. both of them are really good.

service:

the service here is really commendable. the staff is cordial and always available at your service. within no time from ordering they serve the food hot at your plate.

value for money:

i can't comment on the vegetarian food but for the non vegetarians this restaurant is a treat and the prices are worthy enough. we can try a variety of dishes which we haven't even encountered in the menu of regular hyderabad restaurants. so mark it and visit this place for your next dining. have good food and great experience :)",4,Positive

then we tried main course nalli gosht and murgh lababdar with bread, murg musallam and hyderabadi mutton biryani.

hyderabadi daawat, a new place in town located at gachibowli. a place know from serving pure authentic hyderabadi cuisine! and this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

talking about the ambiance, it's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful interiors and great flighting.

we were here for lunch and since it was our first visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their signature dishes.

but before that since it was very hot, we ordered for mocktails.
strawberry mojito, virgin mojito, blue hawaii, soda fountain and mango mule were among the mocktails we had, they're amazing and refreshing!

started with yakhni shorba: very delicious, mutton was cooked properly. soup was served very hot!

murg sholay kebabs: the signature starter of this place, very well presented with the mini bbq sizzling grills. the chicken was little hard, should've cooked for a little longer.

wok tossed chicken: chicken was soft and tender tossed in sauces, little sweet. chopped with bell peppers and spring onions of topping. absolutely delicious.

phuket fish: one of the best fishes i had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, slightly spicy. a must try.

sikanderi raan: the house speciality! the most tender meat i've ever had in life, probably the best you'll get in hyderabad. very tender, full of masalas and loaded with ghee. the marination for the whole raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. highly recommended!

chelo kebabs: another house speciality, the kebabs were tender, smokey and delicious. served along with mild flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, sunny side up and salad . a perfect platter for 2 people!

murg musallam: i've had this in many places, didn't really like it, but here it was one of the bests i had in the city. though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. the whole chicken is stuffed with minced meat and boiled eggs! chicken is marinated with many spices and curd mainly. cooked very perfectly, tender and absolute scrumptious. served along with flavoured rice! highly recommended and the best murg masallam you'll ever find!

chicken tikka lababdar: scrumptious, slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. no colors added in the gravy, just delicious!

nihari gosht: i usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, but i had faith in this palace that they serve good meat. as their mutton starters were excellent, even from the main course this gravy was scrumptious. spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. we had these 2 delicious curries with hot butter naans! i would recommend these 2 curries, a must try!

mutton biryani: very flavourful, meat was perfectly. rice grains were of a good quality! just that they added a lot of cardamom in it, with which the biryani gave a strong flavour. tasted pretty good.

ended the day with desserts: hot shahi tukda and matka firni. both tasted delicious, they weren't too sweet. perfect to end our day.

outstanding and fantastic experience at hyderabadi daawat, one of the places to serve authentic hyderabadi cuisine, no colors and preservatives. hope this place will never disappoint! it was worth travelling 25 km's to visit this place. the staff was humble and took good care of us.",5,Positive
"hyderabadi daawat as the name suggests has some authentic hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in hyderabad! ever been to a hyderabadi daawat before? no not the hotel we're talking about a function, well if you've been to one then you definitely know how much a hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the menu! and here at hyderabadi daawat, the restaurant, you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy! the hotel is very easy to locate! its on the main road...while coming from orr or gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you're coming from miyapur side then it will be on your left! the restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors, very calm and cozy place! they also have banquet hall and a conference hall and they also undertake catering orders for parties and functions! and after the ""dastar"" was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the yakhni shorba! shorba is nothing but the soup! yakhni shorba is a dish from kashmir...people in the north tend to have it more! and it is a very good source of protein! usually it is mild in spice level but at hyderabadi daawat owing to the spice cravings of hyderabadis it was made a little spicy! but the taste was fantastic! it was the best way to start off your meal! next came the starters in which we were served the wok tossed chicken, phuket fish, sikandari raan and murgh sholay kebab! let's start with what we loved the most: the sikandari raan! ‚ù§ it's one whole leg from the goat or sheep! you know for a fact that mutton and beefs aren't usually as tender as chicken but the chefs at hyderabadi daawat changed this notion entirely! the mutton from the raan was soo soft tender and juicy that your teeth has no work to do...cause it just melts! and talking about the spices...it was very mild in spice and very well marinated! coming to the significance of the name sikandari raan! most of you must be knowing that alexander the great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as sikandar e azam! after winning one of the battles in 300 b.c at takshila he took the ruler called porus as captive and when porus was asked what he wanted he told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo alexander or sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this raan was signature dish! and since then it is named as sikandari raan! well, we think no other name would have justified the size and taste of this dish better than sikandari raan! a must must have for you all! highly recommended dish if you're here! üòç the next best starter was the phuket fish! it's a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions, ginger garlic paste and tossed in soya and chilli sauce! the taste was of another level! next we had the wok tossed chicken! wok tossed is an east asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming! the taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew! soo we recommend the chef to look into that! and next came the murgh sholay kebab! it was the barbeque styled chicken! very nicely marinated and tender to eat! and the presentation was amazingly done! üëåüèª after we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called chelo kebab! it was extremely well presented! chelo kebab is an iranian dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs! the chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour! after this the main course was started in which we were served the chicken lababdar, nihari gosht, and murgh musallam with butter naan! nihari gosht was love! ‚ù§ it wasn't like the usual nihari that you eat on a regular basis! it was different and very thick and spicy! and the mutton which they used was really tender! do try this dish here! chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo! üòç murgh musallam was completely different here when compared to the murgh musallam we had at other places! here they serve the murgh musallam with rice! and the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs! you should definitely try this dish! ‚ù§ we were done with all this but how can you even think that a hyderabadi daawat would end without the hyderabadi biryani? we had the mutton biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions! the aroma of the ghee added to the taste of the biryani! üòçüòç and the daawat came to an end with the desserts you commonly find in a hyderabadi daawat...matka firni and double ka meetha! double ka meetha is the very usual dish you see in the functions of hyderabad! it is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added! and at hyderabadi daawat it was perfectly made and was served hot! ‚ù§ overall the lunch here was a terrific experience and we all just loved it! and also a special mention to the owner of this place who is a very kind hearted and a humble person! he speaks to you related anything and everything you have to ask or tell and takes the feedback whether good or bad with a smile! way to go sir! üëåüèª",5,Positive
"this place is only a few months old. it's true that hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines, mainly there are n number of cafe's, bars, food joints. the new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture.
hyderabadi daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends.
it excells in real flavours used in hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes.
starting with the mocktails section, there is a huge variety. from the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones. the signature mocktails and a must try outs are mango bloom, soda fountain and strawberry mojito.
coming to the starters, it's the best to begin with some soup. yakhni shorba is the best try out soup.
phucket fish, wok tossed chicken and sholay kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu. sikandari raan.. the signature item from the menu is the show stealer. the presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately.
heading to the main course, hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani. this place has amazing mutton biryani which is flavoured so well. the aroma is literally breathtaking. chicken tikka lababdar and nihari ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan. the main ""main-course"" is murg massalam, a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs. this dish was superb in taste as well as presentation. after a full on meal desserts are a must. matka firni and double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal.
the staff here is very polite and friendly. the ambience is serene and calm,goes well while having your meal here. the place has a huge space of sitting area. the indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling.
overall its a place you can go to with your family for an amazing lunch or dinner. most recommended!!!",4,Positive
just average üëé i had paya shor a from this place and must its not worth. you can have it alongside rice or roti but not all alone like a soup. they gave 2 small pieces infact very small and the quantity also too less. utne mei kya hoga? infact #payashorba is an absolute waste from here. completely disappointed. i have given 2 stars just for the packaging. well it was neat. rest all i don't prefer to have from this restaurant againüëé.,2,Negative
"review is for delivery only.
ordered dum la murg asifi, with roti and nan.

"probably i am having a bad experience with hyderabad food these days. so i thought of ordering from a 4* restaurant to be sure.

ordered masala kulcha. they definitely dont know what a kulcha is and what masala is. it was a tandoori roti. with a little carrot dressing. how can they charge 50 rs for that? above all this, it was slightly over burnt and had no butter.

surely not ordering from this place again!",1,Very Negative
i ordered biryani from this place. biryani was very dry. rice didn't have any taste. without salan it was not possible to eat the biryani. major part of the rice was white without masala.,3,Neutral
"visited hyderabadi daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. the ambience, service, food were really gr8. was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. ordered paya shorba which was deliciously made. succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. for starters we ordered murgh ke sholay, phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. every item was a revelation. gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. for mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. it being a persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. perfect. and the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. wondered why we have not visited this place before. a definite must visit from me. keep it up team hd. you rock!!!!",4,Positive
"looking at the overall rating & the close promixity to our office, visited this place for lunch along with my team today. looks like this place is mainly for it people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches ( 12+). nothing great to say about the interiors, ambiance it is decent enough. i am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian, but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food.

veg: not that great, we ordered panneer tikka & palak sheek kebab for starters, sabzi nawabi handi & butter naan for mains. panneer is rubbery & not soft indicating it is not fresh. palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste & not cooked properly. as suggested by the staff, we opted for sabzi nawabi handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good. service wise, they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well.

non veg: sikendari raan is a standout dish whereas the other murg musallam is bland with no taste/spiceness to it. same is the case with yakhni shorba which tasted like hot gravy water.

overall i would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service.",3,Neutral
"ordered chicken biryani from this place last night and it was delivered within 45 min with good packing.

coming to the food, biryani was not upto the mark. rice was quite plain and don't have masala, however it looks amazing but lacks the flavour. there is one thing called less masala or spices but rice here was actually more on the bland side, rice quality was superb but taste was missing which usually hyderabadi biryani have. mirch ka salan was decent so as the raita, chicken pieces were having some masala and spices but somewhere some of the pieces were little raw from inside and not completely cooked. when eaten with mirch ka salan and pieces then only there was little bit of taste otherwise it wasn't decent enough also. ordered from zomato on special prices otherwise the price tag which they have is high. didn't found this biryani value for money.",2,Negative

quality- 5/5: the food was awesome, great taste just they should have given some raita or chutney with pulao eventually i was bored of eating pulao, it was less spicy and more sweet
quantity- 3/5 : the quantity of pulao was good but sabz sheek kebab was very costly just ten piece for 260 rupees is too much
value for money: 4/5- the quantity was less still it could be considered valuable as the food was very tasty but the cold drink mrp was 20 and they gave it for double price dont know if they added some thing in colddrink from there end that they charged double
overall is recommended if you eat less and have extra money to spend",4,Positive

"i am a huge fan of regional cuisines. the diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range india possess. it also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it‚Äôs just a festival of flavors. cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the nizams, rayalseema to telugu cuisines.

hyderabadi dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of nizams. from slow cooked raans to delicious biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and i was really excited to go for it.

as i went in for a dinner, we started with a serving of a traditional yakhni shorba, a great start to the meal. with every sip, the intense flavor starts to get you. then there was an array of appetizers that really got me. we had the achaari paneer tikka, where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix. for the non vegetarians, we had murgh kalmi kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix. the gosht seekh kebab was wonderful as well. it was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the patrani fish. the fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste.

the restaurant also took the pain to present us their special sikandari rann, where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor. it was served on a bed of fried onions, garlic with some mutton shami kebabs on the side. every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day. moreover, there were also some persian chelo kebabs and murgh mussallum for us to enjoy, served along with their range of condiments.

 the rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us. we had gosht masala, achari chicken and nargisi kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot stuffed kulchas and flaky garlic naans. the nargisi kofta was my favourite of the night. it just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it. the gosht masala was spicy but the achari chicken was incredible too. desserts like gil-e-firdaus and fruit salad marked the end of our meal.

in a nutshell, the true culture and authentic flavors of hyderabad is being exhibited here. so, hyderabadi dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list! go give them a visit!",4,Positive

"ask anyone what you like about hyderabad the most, the answer is always food! hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in india! irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! but where to eat in hyderabad? as an ardent foodie, i get this question asked, all the time. so to my non-hyderabadi friends i have always been recommending legendary irani restaurants for biryani and or any hyderabadi dish. because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

but that has changed now. thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic biryani. the legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! in the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the cyberabad area.

one such new entrant is hyderabadi dawat. it is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! and its evident in their authentic hyderabadi food.

hyderabadi daawat is located at gachibowli-kondapur road. it is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. just how hyderabadis like it! the menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a nawabi hyderabadi wedding reception!

we were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! we started with a mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 the starters started with achari paneer tikka which was surprisingly good. though not their forte, it had perfect taste and softness! the veg shami was another great starter! the only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

then came the first non-veg starter, the murgh kalmi kebab! chicken thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. it had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! it was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

then came seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! but this one at hyderabadi daawat made me feel like home! it had the perfect hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. had a proper seekh kebab after a long time!

tandoori jhinga was just good! nothing great but then no flaws either!

their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

the first one was the sikandari raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! it was one hell of a royal dish! but the meat could have been cooked more. in fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

the second khaas peshkash was chelo kebab platter! a persian delicacy that consists of rice, a seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! this dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. not very spicy though!

finally, it was time for the king of them all, the murgh musallam. a mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. it is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. see the pics and decide for yourself!

that was our nawabi hyderabadi daawat at this royal restaurant!

i'm glad the hyderabadi cuisine is now going fine dine!

take my word, hyderabadi daawat serves, authentic hyderabadi food!",5,Positive

only word of advice for the management is please stop applying gst on products sold at mrp such as cold drinks and water bottles. gst should not be calculated on those products.

paid a visit on the occasion of diwali. the serving manager was very courteous and humble. he suggested some good starters and we finally picked up veg. garlic sticks. shorba is a must try. dal makhni with roomali roti is heaven. double ka meetha was way too ‚Äòmeetha‚Äô. overall the preparation is sumptuous and pocket friendly. must visit.,4,Positive

"'say no more!'

food - the name itself will get any hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! and certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!

i'll list out my favorites first, in the starters i just fell in love with the murgh kalmi kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! i jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise yakhni shorba (indianized mutton soup) was a great way to get things started! it had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! sabz ki shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. paneer achari kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! gosht sheekh kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. patrani fish, wrapped inside a banana (i'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, i'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! tandoori jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!

the drinks got mixed reactions! well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! we gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us cinderella, caramel mint mojito and mint cooler which just blew us all away! i hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!

the main course had us dying! we were already so full and there was plenty of food left! gosht achari, murgh achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! nargisi kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.

special mention goes to 'sikendari raan' for ‚Çπ1490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! if you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your mutton cravings! food gets a solid 10/10! need to work on the drinks though!

ambiance - it is a huge property just opposite to sln terminus. with ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! although the place is well lit, i didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'hyderabadi daawat' should incorporate anything and everything hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! i had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic lungi, have marfa (hyderabadi band baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! well you never know, i'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! ambiance gets 8/10!

service - it was decent! as they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! the food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! i'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! the waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! overall service gets 8/10!

why hyderabadi daawat? #authentic

will i specially go to hd? sometimes :)",4,Positive
"it's always good to see restaurants which focus on hyderabadi cuisine since it's so diverse and encompasses a lot of different varieties within it. hyderabadi daawat does justice to it's name but treating us to good hyderabadi food.

the restaurant is located on the gachibowli - kondapur mainroad with convenient parking. the interiors are classy and comfortable.

the dish that started off the daawat was the yakhni shorbha which was meticulously done - spicy, meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone.
achari paneer - seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection.
sabz ki shami - the textures felt a little strange to me.
tandoori aaloo- soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exterior
murgh kalmi kebab - marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor.
gosht seekh kebab- it is extremely easy to dry out a seekh kebab but they nail it here.
patrani fish and tandoori jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste.
their main course comprised of murgh mussalam, nargisi kofta, achari murgh, shahi paneer, dal akbari, gosht masala.
their sikandari raan and murgh mussalam deserve a special mention.
a variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the lemon mint cooler, cinderella ( slightly on the sweeter side) and coco baliney.
their service was exceptional where the minutest details were taken care of.",4,Positive
"the name is a giveaway here! this place specialises in hyderabadi cusinie and we were here for a food review session.
ambience- decent with ample space. it's a fine dine place you can visit with your family.
food- this place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian, my review revolves around their veg food and beverages.

the food was well prepared and presented overall. i liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti basket. two of my favourite beverages from the evening were caramel mojito and lemon mint.

the menu is vast and really reasonable. do not miss this place if you like hyderabadi cusinie. even if you're not a fan, do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates.

"i have always been a fan of regional cuisines of india for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition. and its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. and with the imprint nizams have left on the city of hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in hyderabadi cuisine.

hyderabadi dawaat is one new joint in gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. from slow cooked raans to delicious biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.

coming to the food, i went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional yakhni shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. with every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.

then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. from the vegetarian ones, i personally loved the achaari paneer tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. from the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the murgh kalmi kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, gosht seekh kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and patrani fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.

from among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their sikandari rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some mutton shami kebabs on the side. each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. in a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like chelo kebabs which is a persion styled serving of mutton and chicken kebabs on a bed of saffron rice and murg mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.

even after the rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their gosht masala, achari chicken and nargisi kofta all of which went really well with some hot stuffed kulchas and flaky garlic naans. nargisi kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. gosht masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. with the achari chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. gil-e-firdaus and fruit salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.

the service here at hyderabadi dawaat was just as good as their food. the staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. i was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. in a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of hyderabad on a plate, hyderabadi dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!

"being a big foodie myself, i would say this is the best fine dine place for all types of cuisines.. the ambience and hospitality is great to match up to it's delicious food.. there are two exclusive dishes over here which were sikendari raan and murg musallam and i have to say that those dishes will keep you wanting to come back to this restaurant again and again...",5,Positive
"so the place is named as hyderabadi daawat, is actually not just hyderabadi food. they have turned this up to a multi cuisne serving hyderabadi , mughlai , oriental and a bit of continental. we though here were just to try the mughlai , a bit of hyderabadi and a little north indian style of food. lets check them out. #hyderabadfoodexplorer #letsexplorehyderabad ...

"hyderabadi cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. but there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of nizams. you always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. hyderabadi daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. 

my dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.

dishes like #murghmussalam , #murghkalmikebab, #chelokebab, #patranifish, #goshtmasala, #sikanderraan and many more. while a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). 

must try : #acharichicken, #goshtmasala, #kalmikebab, #paneerachari, #dalakbari and #nargasikofta

do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and i'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich hyderabadi daawat cuisine. i'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (mainly mr. dilawar was so gracious)

"a newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a sunday afternoon we landed.

a quick confirmation via zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff.

menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier. earned a 1/2 star!

ordered pathar-gosht and afghan kebab as wanted to start off light. as surprising as it can be the afghan kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. pathar-gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. another star earned for starters.

when in hyd go for biryani- so how couldn't we as we ordered biryanis - chicken and mutton. prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !

taste was good as they took care that the biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. the colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the typical hyderabadi style.

with tummies full we ordered blue mojito and it too scored as expected...amazing. time for a wrap up as the manager mr. dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. a true gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.

my view: an amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with family and friends. located conveniently in main road to gachibowli, daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting hyd. when in daawat- don't forget to try their pathar-gosht and not to forget the amazing raan they boast of being their super speciality.

"a newly opened daawat restaurant on kondapur road. we visited on saturday evening without prior booking. the decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting.

we ordered mojito and ginger peach mocktails along with daawat khas veg kebab platter. mocktails were good but little too sweet. veg platter was good but nothing excellent. paneer particularly wasn't so fresh. we directly went for veg and chicken dum biryanis. again, both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary.

overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich. you can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families.",3,Neutral
"my husband and i, visited zega for their dimsum festival and we were not disappointed.
the service started with a delicious bowl of thukpa, which had a perfect blend of spice. followed by an array of dimsums, each being delicious and warm. the chicken gyoza was absolutely mind blowing. i could eat a zillion of those!
the dimsums (which we were full after) were followed by the main course which included fried rice/soft noodle with chicken and fish(we did not try the vegetarian dishes)
the cherry on the cake was the dessert! toffee banana with ice cream. ugh! delicious!!
our bill was ~ 1700/- for 2
worth every penny.

"zega is a beautiful pan asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of sheraton hyderabad. the restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic pan asian dishes that one could ask for.

i went there for their ongoing dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall. the dimsum food festival had a variety of thukpa options ranging from chicken, mutton, pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from china. next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.

the first thing to try out was their chicken thukpa. it was simply delicious. the broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. the amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. this was something i personally recommend all of you to try.

next up, we were offered some of their dimsums. the showstopper of the day were pan fried chicken gyoza, pok choi roasted garlic and napa cabbage crystals, prawn crystal wraps and vegetable beijing dumpling. the prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.

for mains, we ordered for wok tossed chicken in dry chilli cashews, crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side vegetable fried rice and vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. the chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. it was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.

with out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. this was magical. i have been a lover of toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. the creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.

all in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of pan asian food. the staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing. happy eating. :)",4,Positive
"it's been a very long desire to taste the pan asian food at zega, very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet, well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar, coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request, taste of the food was just ok, need to relook into the clasic dishes, over all it was a very average dining experience at zega.",2,Negative

we ordered thai curry red chicken for main course ,it was coconut milk curry paste had taste of lime grass,basil ,some veggie like baby corn ,beans also used ,having ting of sweetness,served with little portion of rice just for one person if your tummy is empty ,thai curry tasted nice,cooked very well.

"sheraton is a big brand in the hotel industry and famous for its cuisines! one of the best place for a fine dine experience, the restaurant is of high class with a gigantic bar.

the seating is decent, food menu has limited options, yet the flavors are deep rooted.

order some keema patty, keema pao and cheese maggi. the menu seems ordinary, however, the taste is top notch. the cold coffee is average, and needs some serious work.

nothing much to say apart from the hospitality of the amazing staff. do visit for sharing your experience!!",4,Positive

"this place is good unless you look at the menu card. it's like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend. 900 rs for a glass of wine ? well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass.
but if you're a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this.

dj plays some really nice music.
and one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am.",3,Neutral

this is an amazing place to hang out. 10 th floor. ask for neel or arjun to get best of the hospitality. sai is the masters for making the deadly drinks. awesome place to unwind. be here and you will realise. crispy veg is a must to try and feel the heaven. kailash manager is a head strong guy who doesn't know the courtesy to treat the customers,4,Positive

would not like to even give 1* as service was pathetic. staff was appearing to be busy and had no courtesy to attend our table in the centre of the restaurant. starters were served after main dish though they were ordered much before. one of the staff half served a dish to a couple of guests on our table and hopped to other table without finishing her task without any apology. we had to keep on asking for a dish (sushi) which was ordered 90 mins. before it was served. noisy place...,1,Very Negative
"table was not clean and there were stains on it, obviously not a 5 start standard. food was ok ok not something great with limited variety on menu. service was below average as they were not prompt i had to wait every time to get something served on the plate or need to call them and ask to serve. on a whole the experience was very poor. nothing great when i visited with my wife for dinner.",2,Negative

"there are places that deserve a 5 star but they're worth a single visit. this one's different. the restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits. the food taste and quality exceeded the expectations. the presentation was great. nice and courteous waiting with quick service.

however, the security of the hotel (sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called zega. also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.

it was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. but i cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.

anyway. it's a must visit. i apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5. but, i really had no choice based on the inconvenience at the entrance.",4,Positive

"we went for a family dinner on 15th april. being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba. noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. however we went inside and opted for a buffet. the food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). the fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. the most annoying thing was the on the table service. the table wasnt ready when we were seated. we had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. multiple times. the empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. the taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star.",3,Neutral

"had been there for lunch on a friday afternoon. they have a very cosy atmosphere with a wonderful view of the gachibowli road from atop the 10th floor. their food was something that we thoroughly enjoyed. we had their awesome tyangra style hakka fired prawns which was sweet and mildly spicy. there were about 6 chunky prawns in a plate. their maki salmon sushi was great as well if not the best. then we had the chinese barbecue pork belly ribs which was chunky, succulent and juicy. in short, we had a really great meal and look forward to a second visit there soon.",4,Positive

good ambience.. great food.. well i would say best parathas out there in the area. served with curd and green and red chutney will make you feel eat more but you can't as only one will fill you tummy. comes in great packaging if you order online. 15 to 20 mins is average cooking time. so less wait more taste and great value for money is all that you need.,5,Positive

coming over to the taste, i would say i loved it. the aloo parantha was excellent. the corn cheese parantha was good too but i couldn't find any cheese in that parantha. i guess i would never order corn and cheese parantha again. but i would love to try other paranthas by triptify and wpuld definitely recommend others to try this place!!",4,Positive

"i had ordered manchow soup. the taste was very nice. it felt like a great start . crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the soup, chicken was cooked well, overall a very good subtle starter. the chilli chicken dry was one of the best i've tasted,was kinda smoky, chicken was cooked very well. the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing,cooked to perfection. only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the chilli garlic burnt sauce tasted extremely weird. the chicken fried rice was not that great too . it had good aroma and aura but taste was average . the restaurant had good ambience. overall it was good experience",3,Neutral
"it is overrated casual chinese food, with lot of oil. you can call it more of indian chinese. ordered wolly chicken average. flat noodles very oily. thread chicken was oily. the captain/manager denied us axis bank card discount because it was not told before. no restaurant denied me that discount before. quantity is too much and they charged more than what was mentioned in the menu. seriously it is an overated ""indian chinese"" restaurant. one star is for the thread chicken starter (oily, fried).",1,Very Negative
"overrated place. it's a disappointment and below par as per taste. we had panok prawns, you could taste the batter, it's basically the deep fried prawns however the taste is not at al upto the mark. schewan noddles and chicken garlic sauce is below par. nothing great about the place.",2,Negative

"we love chinese food and we headed for chinese pavilion to have dinner on a wednesday evening. we reached there by 7:30 and we were the first customers, by 8:30 onwards people started to fill the restaurant. it‚Äôs not difficult to find the place since is on the main road.

ambiance is nice, the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing. decors have chinese items so it‚Äôs not bad.

service was spot on, we were attended very. it didn‚Äôt take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen.

for food we had satay chicken sticks and spicy black bean lamb for starters, teppan soba noodles sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts. the satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. the lamb was good but not wow. the noodles tasted awesome! it came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. usually in india is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience. the prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely. recommend!

"such good place for chinese food...

ambience: nice and peaceful.

taste: very good. i had lemon grass soup since i had a sore throat and it helped me more than i wished for. lemon, coriander, and chillies have all added to the flavors. the crispy water chestnut starter is sweet but tasty. i could not stop myself from finishing the sweet coriander sauce that had a hint of mint.
teppan soba noodles, a sizzler, is just as good. all in all, a happy experience!

will i visit again: yes!

cost effectiveness: average. about 700 for a person.

experience enhancers: the staff who are well aware of how the food is made. very nice service",4,Positive
"been to this place twice for dinner and haven't been disappointed. we ordered a lemongrass soup, honey potato (please lookup exact names in the menu) to begin with and proceeded to have veg soft noodles and manchurian. the manchurian isn't the desi version that you get in most places so the spice levels can be a let down. but the noodles were thin and light. overall a delicious meal. definitely recommend it!",4,Positive

they served us a bland soup and when we enquired about it the ""captain ""(person who took the order) said we should taste the soup first before asking.
the captain was disrespectful and dismissive also charged us full price for soup that was unpalatable.
needless to say we didn't try anything else there.",1,Very Negative

"we have been here on weekend afternoon for lunch as we want to have a authentic chinese. nice ambience, less crowded & peaceful environment. warmly welcomed by staff. coming to food as we have kid with us, so the dishes we ordered were of less spice. ordered some veg soup, couple of starters. i must say veg soup was made to perfection, full marks. we didn't like starters; honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be & babycorn starter has no taste (no salt, no spice). but again main course specially egg fried rice was very nice & tasty (could have ordered a bit more spicy one; bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored, so no complaints). over all good experience, but spicy levels are far less :)

"visited this place on a friday evening. saw good rating on zomato and decided to give this place a try.
this place has great ambience and decent staff. we ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good. but if you see the attached image to this review, the cucumber and salad, which i got was not fresh and this had disappointed me. you would expect fresh food on your table, when you pay premium price.
we then ordered garlic based noodles (cant remember the name), mongolian chicken and lime soda. the food was great but again, we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed.
overall i would say the food was great, a bit pricey though. i could not give a great rating because of the things mentioned above.",2,Negative
"this is my favourite neighbourhood chinese restaurant, love the jade chicken soup here as well as seafood. the staff is courteous, fast & love the quiet ambience, fragrance, decent & less crowded. a bit expensive (costs around 1000-1500 for 2 pax) place considering the locality but its worth the money.",4,Positive

"mediocre food .
ordered wanton soup and chicken dimsum.
for a crazy dimsum lover , the dish was unappealing as the outer cover was thick , though the chicken portions were decent . the wanton soup was mediocre.
what bothered me was the service personnel hurried his way through the order and mentioned that only main course can be served. it was still 15 minutes for the closing time.
i just feel some personal touch would have been better.
will explore some more dishes , before commenting further",3,Neutral

the chineese cuisine served here has a delightful taste to it. the pan fried item's are the best and must try in the menu. the pricing is costly, one would feel it over priced right from the moment of the first sight of menu. overall a family restaurant with good chineese cusine and strictly a no friends hangout place.",4,Positive

we ordered:

stuffed mushrooms: they were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. and quantity was great.

mushroom in shechuan sauce: we ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, i have never tasted tofu before so i can't say. but we didn't really like it.

hakka noodles: noodles tasted great. really tasty, and quantity was really good.

fresh lime soda: it was really good and refreshing.

fried rice: it was decent with good amount of veggies. quality of rice was good.

stir fried greens: it was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like broccoli, pringle etc

every dish i liked. jade chicken soup was something new for me & having spinach in i was wondering how it would taste. but to my surprise in was too good.terriyaki chicken was excellent. chicken fried rice was something that i dint like much but haka noodles was a good one. would recommend to visit there once as they also serve small portion which is really very innovative & helpful for customers to try more dishes.

the place is not bad, easy to find, valet and comfortable seating. service was decent as well.

food was outrageous, the order was chicken corn & manchow soups which were ok, prawns and teriyaki chicken which were decent but the killer was pan fried noodles, if you cant make it the way it is supposed to be then why keep it in the menu??

vegetables - baby corn, brocolli appeared stale and they got a wierd mushroom, which was yuckyyy to the core. i eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible.

stay away from pan fried!!!!",2.5,Negative

quick feet,friendly and humble staff make your visit a memorable one.
we ordered:
jade soup:this could seem a lil bland according to many.but for me spinach broth with sliced garlic was packed with oriental touch.for a change shredded meat in soup was not rubbery.

sea wars : this appetizer was blend of fried prawns,fish and squid .the chilli soy sauce and sweet coriander sauce served on side added a wonderful touch to this delightful dish.

fook chook fried rice: white sauce (not cream based) topped fried rice had a subtle flavor.it was loaded with vegetables.

honey noodles with ice cream : texture of the noodles here was nothing like the ones i tasted earlier.fried noodles had a fudgy texture with went along real well with thick creamy ice cream.
fruit punch was decent.but pinacolda has to be improved.
i recommend you to visit this place if you enjoy oriental cuisine sparcely infused with indian flavors

"if its chinese then it's this place ! no other place in hyderabad has chinese food this good ( well at least till now )
let me start of by complementing the service of this place- such a homely and warm feel when each waiter was more than willing to make us comfortable, the owner mr. ali, who himself helped us out in deciding what to order based on our pallet. the food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself, it was way better than what we wanted.
our order came in around 15 min ( maybe lesser ) and it consisted of crispy lamb, noodles saut√©ed in this wonderful butter garlic combination!!, mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce!! the food was exceptionally good ! each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream ( the best darsaan i've ever had ).

this place was bookmarked for a long time now so i wanted to pay it a visit. and finally the moment came when i was actually able to go there. i am a huge fan of indo-chinese cuisine and i honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. 

i ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the chinese food. 

wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. 

all in all, the food wasn't enjoyable. 

will i visit again? probably not! i am sorry!

#foodshaukeen #chinesepavilion

chinese pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a chinese restaurant, and i wasted no time in suggesting this üòâ. visited gachibowli branch which is above ccd and is in the same building of up the bistro.
their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably.
pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 - 350 . a tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 ai.
have ordered manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds. red chilli prawns (dry), bbq chicken, three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers. prawns teppan yaki, pan fried and tossed along with chilli garlic and butter tasted real good. bbq chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better. show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish, a wonderful combo to your taste buds. three treasure veggies had broccoli, baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me. had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces, could have done wonders.
among main course was schezwan fried rice and cp special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce, tasted okish as sauce did not impress me as much as i expected. schezwan rice was delicious though, right to the spices. requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles üòï.

service : though their service is quick, staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order. something that is important from customer point of view.

bottomline : there were few misses and few hits. however, most of the dishes were towards sweeter side. i wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception.",3.5,Neutral

"my favorite chinese restaurant in hyderabad. food is splendid and its never crowded. the waiters are connoisseurs.

the royal thai soup is what a soup should be.
the roasted lamb with superior sauce tastes great with the pepper sauce.
the pan fried noodles will make your day.
oh and the chocolate mousse will give you sweet dreams.",5,Positive
"just went due to the zomato rating. small place, may be 40-45 seater restaurant. close to offices. has valet parking, which most of the small restaurants doesn't have. staff is courteous. they have a daily course meals round the week. good option instead of buffets. every item in the platter is good. nothing wrong to point out. lighter on pockets, go for it. with bhaskar varada",4,Positive
"amazing food,good ambience & great service...this is what describes chinese pavilion. their chinese is blended in indian flavors & that is what makes it so special! the chopsuey,all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish/prawn starters. the best part about their food is it isn't bland,it is mixed with indian flavors ensuring the chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy. if you want to try something different within the chinese cuisine this place won't disappoint you. and the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice. i am going with a 4.5 because i beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and i request every foodie to visit this place. this is honestly one of the few chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an indian touch. worth a visit any day!",4.5,Positive
"the food was just average. staffs were very nice. serving time was also nice. the taste of food can be betternwith beyyer cooks. comparing the price to the taste..... its not at all worth.

thank you team for awesome service!",5,Positive
"chinese cuisine including diverse styles from various parts of chine has not only influenced the food landscape in various parts of asia but across the world. one of the most simple yet complicated in flavor profiles. india has also embraced so much of asian cuisine that you can vouch that most of indian foodie community next to their regional cuisine would be fans of chinese cuisine. chinese pavilion is one of the most consistent brand in hyderabad that you keep hearing for authentic no non-sense chinese dishes at not to alarming prices and yet have strong fan following.  i for one of them was a fan as i dined here last year and fate had me to dine her with fellow foodie bhais exactly after a year and i had to be blown away by the food only to believe that no wonder this place has been awarded the best chinese restaurant 2016 from times of india . big bow to owner mr. sayed ali and also our foodie guru taher bhai for making our menu selection so easy and making it one of the memorable dinner in recent times hands down. ...

"had dinner here yesterday. went here without reading any reviews and were hence with no expectations..very good place for veg. chinese. they have got everything right.... ambience, service and most importantly food.. waiters were friendly enough to suggest items in menu basis our preference. courteous service and great food at reasonable price ( considering the portion size).... what else do you want.",4,Positive
what a delightful place. food was the star here and we were left literally grinning ear to ear by the end of it all. a feat considering how grumpy i was at prospect of consuming vegetarian food on account of ganesh chaturthy. but one sip of vietnamese noodles soup later we were already celebrating. halfway into thai red curry/steamed rice i had already activated my man-vs-food mode but it all abruptly ended after my wife swiftly got everything parcelled. happy.,5,Positive
"writing this right after having a very satisfying take out meal. chinese pavilion never disappoints! every item in the menu is delicious and distinct! the soups, chicken in banana leaves, bamboo rice, veggies with water chestnuts and so much more to love!",4.5,Positive
"searched for chinese cuisine nearby and i found this cuisine with better rating but with high costs. thought of visiting this place and really it made my day.
as soup is one of my favorite dishes i started with spicy crab soup.
it was good but found something was missing in it.
i tried to do some modifications and added sugar and venigar which made it awesome.
thai basic chicken fried rice was good. not that spicy but i the rice was very dry. it might tasted better if it was bit wet.
betki fish tossed in crab meat was very good.
that was a great experience with a great ambiance and good service.

"veg review :)

i have visited its other branch in banjara hills many times and have always liked their food.... so wanted to give this branch a try.

food here is great too..

dishes ordered:
pepper fried paneer - i personally don't like starters if they are very crisp so couldn't enjoy it much....

pan fried noodles - amazing :) loved it!!
mushroom pepper chilly - good but felt it didnt go very well with noodles
brownie - very soft and juicy",4,Positive
"initially thought of going to wonton (gachibowli) but on recommendation from a friend arrived here for dinner. restaurant is located near the gachibowli highway on the 1st floor above ccd. restaurant had nice interiors and we were greeted in a warm manner. the staffs were very courteous to explain us the dish details at the time of order. we ordered for potato ball honey pepper sa, dumplings, vegetable manchurian, vegetable black bean noodles, 3 treasure veg chilly. all dishes were served spontaneously and all were almost authentic chinese dishes. there was no soup provided along with dumplings as is provided in kolkata shops. we were disappointed with manchurian as they were too much salty. noodles were perfectly cooked but the babycorns needed to be boiled a bit. overall a wonderful experience as we spent more than 2 hours eating n chitchatting with friends. we also had cakes which we brought from outside. they were very much cooperative to allow us outside food.
taste 3.1/5
service 5/5
price 4/5. there is no service charge on the bill.",3.5,Neutral
had a mixed experience... cant say it is bad cant say it is good... it is ok. we ordered soups and they are fine... later on mixed sea food... prawn is ok and squid is very smelly... another chicken starter it is good. coming to main course... ordered crispy noodles and it is ok and then korean noodles also ok... veg noodles is good. i recommend to try it once.,3,Neutral
"ordered a lot of dishes from this place and and none let us done. was very happy to eat good chinese food in hyderabad after such a long. we ordered spicy crab soup, mongolian chicken, prawns teppan yaki, chicken pan fried noodles,mix xo fried rice, roast lamb oyster chilli, sampan chicken. every dish was cooked to perfection. would love to go back often and often..",4,Positive

"i was never a fan of chinese food until i visited chinese pavilion(banjara hills). when i heard that they've opened a second branch in gachibowli i couldn't wait to visit. however, they were successful in keeping up the quality, taste and my expectations. great food, great ambience and very good service.",5,Positive
"i visited this restaurant with friends and was immediately blown away with the quality of service.
we were seated immediately and the staff was courteous and professional especially with our large group.
the ambience is one of the best i've come across with a rather unusually quirky ceiling piece.
food - i had the stuffed mushroom which was delicious along with a fruit punch and a chocolate volcano.
all in all one of the best culinary experiences i've had in the city.",5,Positive
"im going to cut to the chase, the food is excellent! 

i must say the honey chicken and the thai chow kay is by far the best. 
the man chow soup is another brilliant piece of art! 
for me this chinese pavilion beats any chinese restaurant in the city.  

no wonder its called chinese pavilion! :d",5,Positive
"chinese pavilion in banjara hills was the first chinese restaurant in hyderabad for me and i still have fond memories of the great authentic taste. so, when i heard that they have opened another restaurant in gachibowli which is near to my home, i was excited and took my family to dinner. first of all, the ambience is a huge let down. it looked like any budget restaurant and i was thinking whether i should get out or go in. finally, went in expecting some great food.
we ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. first of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. they are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. the fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. the desert was a disaster. overall, please avoid this restaurant. i am not sure what is the condition of their banjara hills branch now but there are far better chinese eateries around gchibowli as well.",1.5,Very Negative
"madhumathi mahajan well to start with nice courteous servers and staff. excellent serving time, all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out? these things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.

now food - jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. main course was mix xo rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, i thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. so try and rate yourself.

last ambience - was warm n eye soothing.

oh and i forgot, the orange pekoe tea, the best i had in lat few months. have it",3,Neutral
"this place has never disappointed us.. the food, the courteous staff, the serene ambience.. we wanted to have something totally rice free and with very little oil. they served us steamed fish with chilly garlic noodles with chicken. as always it was awesome.. thanks chinese pavilion, it is always a pleasant experience!",4.5,Positive
"bad rating is mainly because of ""chicken bone found in veg food"" and is not acceptable for a vegetarian.

to satiate cravings for chinese food we headed to chinese pavilion and there was also a voucher available in little app for luncheon tray for rs 310 (veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for veg luncheon tray is rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).

the ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.

it was thrusday special (veg):
hot and sour soup: was just ok - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.
kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)
potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well made
brocolli, baby corn, mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried rice
veg hakka noodles - was good
veg fried rice

overall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken bone came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. it was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.
well management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. i requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for veg/non-veg cooking which manager declined which makes me believe they don't.

staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of veg and non-veg as in indian culture it means a lot.

uploaded photos with the bone found.",1.5,Very Negative
"i personally love and prefer chinese food. had been here couple of times with my husband.

the ambiance of the place is very good. the entrance has some carvings and the walls were very nicely decorated. the server was very polite

when it comes to food this place does not disappoint.this is a small/comfy restaurant that is surprisingly not very crowded even on weekends. 

we went there for our anniversary celebrations and it was just perfect. no crowd, we got the attention and service we were looking for.",4,Positive
"checked in here to try some delicious chinese food here, seen non-veg luncheon tray menu ans tried the same which they are charging 300+ taxes..
started with manchow soup and liked it instantly.. thereafter luncheon tray had came with pepper chicken starter, kimchi (salad), wolly chicken, egg fried rice and egg hakka noodles.. taste is fine and didn't liked eating egg hakka noodles and egg fried rice at a time.. badly missed dessert along with tray! (dnt mind for extra price..)
value for money and fine ambience.",3.5,Neutral
